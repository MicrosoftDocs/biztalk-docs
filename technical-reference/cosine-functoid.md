# Cosine Functoid

 

Use the **Cosine** functoid ( ![](images/Aa559678.3ec59432-420e-42e9-816f-45ef26487f54(BTS.80).jpeg)) to return the cosine of an angle.

## Input

**Parameter 1:** A numeric value that is an angle, specified in radians, for which the cosine is sought.

## Output

**Output 1:** A numeric value that is the cosine of the specified angle.

## Remarks

This functoid performs the following trigonometric calculation, where for a right triangle, A is one of the acute angles, H is the length of the hypotenuse, and S is the length of the other adjacent side.

Cosine(A) = S / H (cosine of angle is the adjacent side over the hypotenuse)

A radian is a unit of measure of angles, such that there are 2π radians in a circle. It follows that:

  - 2π radians equals 360 degrees

  - 1 radian = 180/π degrees

  - 1 degree = π/180 radians
