<td>The ENTSSO service requires the adapter to shutdown. The adapter should respond by calling <a href="issonotification-shutdownadapter-method.md">ISSONotification.ShutdownAdapter Method</a>.<br />
<br />
This notification type is supported by group adapters. It indicates that the group adapter only should shut down. Each individual adapter that is part of the adapter group gets its own SHUTDOWN notification.<br />
<br />
It is not necessary to confirm this notification.</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>SSO_NOTIFICATION_TYPE_SHUTDOWN_COMPLETE</strong></td>

<tr class="even">
<td><strong>SSO_NOTIFICATION_TYPE_PASSWORD_CHANGE</strong></td>
<td>0x00000003</td>
<td>Both</td>
<td>A password has changed.<br />
<br />
When sending a password change from an adapter to ENTSSO, the password change is considered to be accepted, and durable, on return from the notification to ENTSSO through <a href="issonotification-sendnotification-method.md">SendNotification</a>. That does not indicate that the password change is complete, but rather that it has been accepted, is durable, and is likely to be accomplished. Under some error conditions queues could fill up, in which case older password changes could be discarded. In general, you should perform more recent password changes than older ones.<br />
<br />
An adapter should make password changes received through <a href="issonotification-receivenotification-method.md">ReceiveNotification</a>, The adapter should make that change durable or effect the change immediately. The adapter should then call <strong>SendNotification</strong> with PASSWORD_CHANGE_COMPLETE for that password change to delete it from the database queue.<br />
<br />
This notification type is not supported by group adapters.<br />
<br />
An adapter must confirm this notification. It is optional for ENTSSO to confirm this notification.</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>SSO_NOTIFICATION_TYPE_PASSWORD_CHANGE_COMPLETE</strong></td>
<td>0x00000004</td>
<td>Both</td>
<td>The ENTSSO service completed the password change. Note that the definition of complete may vary depending on what is configured. For more information, see the Remarks section of <a href="issonotification-receivenotification-method.md">ReceiveNotification</a>.<br />
<br />
You can use the tracking ID to correlate the original request with the response.<br />

This notification type is not supported by group adapters.<br />
<br />
It is necessary for an adapter to confirm this notification. It is optional for ENTSSO to confirm this notification.<br />
<br />
Note that this notification is currently not implemented. ENTSSO will ignore any SSO_NOTIFICATION_TYPE_PASSWORD_EXPIRE messages, and will never send a message of this type to an adapter.</td>

<br />
If the ENTSSO service detects that a password sync adapter has not sent any password changes for some time, it may send a STATUS notification to that adapter as a &quot;keep alive&quot;. The adapter should respond with a STATUS_ONLINE or STATUS_OFFLINE notification.<br />
<br />
This notification type is supported by group adapters. It applies only for the status of the group adapter, not for the adapters within the adapter group.<br />

## Remarks

There is no online or offline notification for adapters to the group adapter. This is because control of the individual adapters is handled by each adapter itself.

In general, the notifications that require confirmation are those that are durable in the database queue. The other notifications are control and status information which are transient. Notifications that require confirmation have one of the confirm flags set.

There is no notification to or from the adapter about enabled or disabled status. This is because the enable and disable is handled by the enable and disable of the underlying configuration store application. Thus, when the adapter is disabled by an administrator, the adapter receives access denied messages from all calls to ENTSSO.

## Requirements
