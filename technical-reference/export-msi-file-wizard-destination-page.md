# Export MSI File Wizard, Destination Page

 

Use the **Destination** page to specify the name of the application as well as the full path, including file name, of the .msi file. The application name that you provide will be included in the list of application names from which you can select for the application when you import it from the .msi file.

## UIElement List

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Use this</th>
<th>To do this</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Destination application name</strong></td>
<td>Type the name of the application.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>MSI file to generate</strong></td>
<td>Type the full path, including file name, of the .msi file that you want to generate, or click the browse button to navigate to the file. If the file does not already exist, it will be created in the path you specify. If it does already exist, you will be prompted to overwrite the existing file.<br />
<br />
Example: C:\MSI Files\MyApplication.msi</td>

</tbody>
</table>
