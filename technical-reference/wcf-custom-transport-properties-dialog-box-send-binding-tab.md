# WCF-Custom Transport Properties Dialog Box, Send, Binding Tab

Â 

Use the **Binding** tab to configure different types of predefined or custom bindings for Windows Communication Foundation (WCF). You can also import and export these settings through the **Import/Export** tab.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>BizTalk Server does not support all the types of the binding extension elements that you can configure on the <STRONG>Binding</STRONG> tab.</P>



## Predefined Bindings

Predefined bindings hide the complexity of the WCF messaging stack. Applications using predefined bindings do not require full control over the stack. The attributes exposed on each predefined binding are the ones most appropriate for the usage scenario the binding addresses. It is not possible to add elements or attributes to a predefined binding. To do so, you should implement a custom binding.

## Custom Bindings

Custom bindings provide full control over the WCF messaging stack. An individual binding defines the message stack by specifying the binding extension elements for the stack elements in the order they appear on the stack. Each binding extension element defines and configures one element of the stack. There must be one and only one `transport` binding extension element in each custom binding. Without this element, the messaging stack is incomplete.

The order in which elements appear in the stack matters, because it is the order in which operations are applied to the message. The recommended order of stack elements is the following:

1.  Transactions (optional)

2.  Reliable Messaging (optional)

3.  Security (optional)

4.  Transport

5.  Encoder (optional)
