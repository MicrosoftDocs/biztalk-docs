# WCF-NetMsmq Transport Properties Dialog Box, Send, Binding Tab

Â 

Use the **Binding** tab to configure the binding properties specific to the WCF-NetMsmq send adapter. The WCF-NetMsmq adapter can communicate with a service through binary-encoded messages over the MSMQ transport. The WCF-NetMsmq adapter provides queued communication in a .NET-to-.NET environment.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The current version of the WCF-NetMsmq adapter does not support WS-Reliable Messaging.</P>

<br />
- <strong>None</strong>: No dead letter queue is to be used.<br />

## Messages Delivered to the Dead Letter Queue

The dead-letter queue is a queue managed by the sending application's Queue Manager that stores messages that have failed to be delivered or have expired. The reasons that a message can fail to reach the receiving application include:

  - A transactional message is sent to a nontransactional queue.

  - A nontransactional message is sent to a transactional queue.

  - An unauthenticated message is sent to a queue that accepts only authenticated messages.

  - An unencrypted message is sent to a queue that accepts only encrypted messages.

  - The message expires before the message is delivered to a receiver.

  - The message storage quota of the target computer or the storage quota of the destination queue is exceeded, or there is no available storage space on the target computer when the message arrives.

  - The sender does not have the access rights needed to place the message in the destination queue.

  - The digital signature attached to the message is not valid.

  - An encrypted message cannot be decrypted by the destination queue manager.

  - The destination queue is purged or deleted before the message is retrieved.


    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>If the <STRONG>Dead letter queue</STRONG> property is set to <STRONG>None</STRONG>, messages can be lost if target queue service failure occurs. If the <STRONG>Dead letter queue</STRONG> property is set to <STRONG>System</STRONG>, failed messages are placed in the transactional dead-letter queue or nontransactional dead-letter queue depending on the <STRONG>Transactional</STRONG> property.</P>
