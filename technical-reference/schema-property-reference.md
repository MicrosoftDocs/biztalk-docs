# Schema Property Reference

 

All of the nodes in the schema tree view, as well as the schema file itself (as displayed in Solution Explorer), have properties. Most of these properties can be examined and set in the Microsoft Visual Studio Properties window. Schema item properties are an exception; they are examined and set in a property pages dialog box.

This section provides reference information about these properties. Schema item and file properties are organized in those categories, while schema node properties, many of which are associated with more than one type of schema node, are summarized according to their node affiliation, and organized alphabetically to provide additional detail.
