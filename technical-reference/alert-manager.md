<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Field Name</th>
<th>Contents</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Name</td>
<td>The name of the alert. The name of the alert is used as the subject of alerts delivered in e-mail and as the file name for alerts delivered as a file. <strong>Note:</strong> Names are limited to 100 characters. Valid alert names must start with a letter. Following characters can be letters, numbers, a space (' '), or an underscore ('_'). Additionally, there cannot be two consecutive spaces in the name.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Message</td>
<td>The text of the message that will be delivered with the alert.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Priority</td>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
