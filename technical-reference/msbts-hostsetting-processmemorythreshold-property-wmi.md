# MSBTS\_HostSetting.ProcessMemoryThreshold Property (WMI)

Â 

This property represents the maximum Process Memory (in percent) allowed before throttling begins (in percent or megabytes).

Set to 0 to disable throttling that is based on process memory. If you provide a percent value (a value between 1 and 100), the threshold is set to the percentage value of the total virtual memory available to the process, including available physical memory, available page-file, memory already allocated to the process, memory addressing limits such as the 2 gigabyte addressing limit for 32-bit memory-addressing architecture, and so forth. When you specify a percent value, the process memory threshold is computed dynamically at regular periodic intervals. If a value above 100 is specified, the threshold will be set to this value in megabytes.

## Syntax

```C#
  
uint32ProcessMemoryThreshold;  
```

## Remarks

The default value for this parameter is 25.

This property is read/write.

The syntax shown is language neutral.

## Requirements

**Header:** Declared in BTSWMISchemaXP.mof.
