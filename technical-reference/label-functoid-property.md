# Label (Functoid Property)

 

Use the **Label** property to provide a name for the selected functoid that makes sense to you in the context of its use.

## Category

General

## Allowed Values

Any string. The string should describe how this functoid is used in the transformation.

## Default Value

None.

## Remarks

Providing an appropriate label for functoids can be useful when multiple functoids of the same type are used in a map. Labeling them appropriately can make map maintenance easier.
