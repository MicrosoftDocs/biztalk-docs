# WCF-Custom Transport Properties Dialog Box, Receive, Behavior Tab

Â 

Use the **Behavior** tab to configure the endpoint and service behaviors for this receive location. An endpoint behavior is a set of behavior extension elements that modify or extend service or client functionality. For example, the **callbackTimeOuts** behavior extension element specifies the interval of time for the client callback within which transactions must complete or be automatically terminated. A service behavior is a set of behavior extension elements that modify or extend service functionality. For example, the **serviceTimeOuts** behavior extension element specifies the interval of time for a service within which transactions must complete or be automatically aborted. You can also import and export these settings through the **Import/Export** tab.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Service behaviors affect only service-related aspects, and endpoint behaviors affect only endpoint-related properties.</P>




> [!NOTE]
> <P>BizTalk Server does not support all the types of the behavior extension elements that you can configure on the <STRONG>Behavior</STRONG> tab.</P>

<br />
The default values are <strong>EndpointBehavior</strong> and <strong>ServiceBehavior</strong>. <strong>Note:</strong> In order for the impersonation scenario to work in the WCF-Custom receive adapter, you must add the <strong>serviceAuthorization</strong> extension under the <strong>ServiceBehavior</strong> and then set the <strong>ImpersonateCallerForAllOperations</strong> to <strong>true</strong> as well as select the <strong>Issue Single Sign-On ticket</strong> option under the <strong>Other</strong> tab in the <strong>WCF-Custom Transport Properties</strong> dialog.</td>
