# Setup Wizard, Welcome Page

Â 


> [!IMPORTANT]
> <P>We recommend that you refer to the latest version of the BizTalk Server 2013 R2 Installation Guide at <A href="/previous-versions/">https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=269585</A>.</P>



The basic installation process for Microsoft BizTalk Server is the same as for most Windows-based applications. The BizTalk Server Setup program calls Windows Installer to install BizTalk Server and the related components. Setup coordinates the installation process from beginning to end, terminating when the last component is installed. If you don't have a component, Setup is able to install prerequisites from the Web or a pre-downloaded CAB file.

With a simplified Installation Wizard, a component updater, and one-click configuration, installing and configuring BizTalk Server is more straightforward and efficient than ever before.
