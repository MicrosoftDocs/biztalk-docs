# Node Properties - Alphabetical Listings

 

Inserting a schema node of any type into a particular position within a schema hierarchy is the first step to making that node an effective member of the schema. Each type of schema node has an extensive set of properties associated with it, such as the name of the node, its data type, the range of occurrences allowed, and so on. Some properties are exclusive to a particular type of node while other properties are shared by several types of nodes, or in a few cases, most or all types of nodes.

This section provides reference information about all of the properties associated schema nodes, organized first according to whether they apply to all schemas, only to property schemas, or only to schemas with the flat file schema extensions. Within these categories, the node properties are organized alphabetically, without regard to the node types to which they apply.
