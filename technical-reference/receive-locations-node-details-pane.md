# Receive Locations Node, Details Pane

Â 

Use the Receive Locations node details pane to manage and control receive locations in an application. Right-click a specific receive location to display the following commands:

  - **Enable**. Causes the receive location to accept inbound messages at the specified address and to submit the messages to the message box.

  - **Disable**. Causes the receive location to no longer accept inbound messages.

  - **Move To Application**. Displays the **Move to Application** dialog box, which you use to move artifacts from the current application in the Administrative Console to a different application.

  - **Delete**. Deletes the selected receive location.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You cannot delete the primary receive location for a receive port. If you attempt this, you will receive an error message. To delete the receive location, you can either delete the receive port, which also deletes the receive location, or you can make a different receive location primary and then delete the original receive location. For instructions on making a receive location the primary receive location, see <A href="/biztalk/core/how-to-edit-the-properties-of-a-receive-location">How to Edit the Properties of a Receive Location</A>.</P>



  - **Properties**. Displays the **Receive Location Properties** window.
