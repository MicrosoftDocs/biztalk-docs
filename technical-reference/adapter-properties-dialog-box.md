# Adapter Properties Dialog Box

 

Use the **Adapter Properties** window to view information about an adapter. You enter the information in the **Adapter Properties** window when you create the adapter. After you have set up the adapter, you cannot edit the properties. When you create a new adapter, send and receive instances for the adapter are automatically generated. The host selected to run the adapter is the default host. You can select a different host in the **Adapter Handler Properties** window if necessary.
