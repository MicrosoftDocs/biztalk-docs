## Remarks


> [!NOTE]
> <P>If a send port or receive location is updated using the BizTalk Explorer object model or a WMI script, the Receive Port Properties and Send Port Properties property pages in BizTalk Explorer will display an incorrect Address (URI). The Address (URI) used internally is the Address (URI) set by the script, so the script works as expected. To update the property pages to display the correct Address (URI), update the Address (URI) field in BizTalk Explorer with the new value.</P>




> [!NOTE]
> <P>This class wraps the managed <STRONG>Microsoft.BizTalk.ExplorerOM.ReceiveLocation</STRONG> class.</P>
