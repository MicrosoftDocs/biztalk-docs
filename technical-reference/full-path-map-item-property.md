# Full Path (Map Item Property)

 

Use the **Full Path** property to examine the file system location of the map file, which is generally the folder of the BizTalk project to which the map belongs.

## Category

Miscellaneous

## Read-Only Value

The file system location of the map file (which is generally the folder of the BizTalk project in which the map was created) combined with the value of the **File Name** property. If you use an existing map in a BizTalk project, it becomes a unique map associated only with that project after it is saved.

## Remarks

Read-only; you cannot directly modify the value of this property.
