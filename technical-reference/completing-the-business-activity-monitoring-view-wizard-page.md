# Completing the Business Activity Monitoring View Wizard Page

Â 

You have successfully created a new Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) view. You will see a PivotTable report appear in your Microsoft Excel workbook.

After the PivotTable report appears in your Excel workbook, you must drag the defined dimensions and measures from the PivotTable tree view and drop them onto the PivotTable area. Also, note that if you do not define dimensions and measures in the view, then only a summary of the details of the BAM view appear on the sheet.
