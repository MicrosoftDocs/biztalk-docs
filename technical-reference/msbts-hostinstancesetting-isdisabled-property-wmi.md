# MSBTS\_HostInstanceSetting.IsDisabled Property (WMI)

Â 

Enables or disables a host instance.

## Property Declaration

*The syntax shown is language neutral.*

```C#
boolean IsDisabled = FALSE;  
```

## Remarks

The **IsDisabled** property can be changed when the host instance is in the stopped or started state. However, if a host instance is disabled while it is running, then the change will not take effect until the host instance is stopped. Thus a running host instance will continue to run even if it is disabled. But once it is stopped, you cannot start it until the **IsDisabled** property is set to FALSE again.

## Requirements

**Header:** Declared in BTSWMISchema2K.mof or BTSWMISchemaXP.mof.

**Namespace:** Included in \\root\\MicrosoftBizTalkServer.
