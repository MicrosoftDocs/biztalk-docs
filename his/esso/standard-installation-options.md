# Standard Installation Options
Host Integration Server takes advantage of the Enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities for securely storing critical information.  
  
 By default, Enterprise Single Sign-On is not installed with the rest of Host Integration Server. You can install it by using the following procedure.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  When Enterprise Single Sign-on (Server component) is installed, configuration must be performed. The first step to set up an SSO system is to configure the master secret server. We recommend that you set up a stand-alone master secret server. You can do this by only selecting Enterprise Single Sign-On from the custom feature tree in  Host Integration Server Setup.  
>   
>  We also recommend that any computer that is running Enterprise Single Sign-On have a time synchronization service running. This keeps the computer time in sync with the rest of the system. This is necessary for SSO ticketing services to function correctly.
