# How to Create User Mappings
Use the **createmappings** command to create one or more user mappings, as specified in the XML file. The following is an example XML file.  
  
```  
<sso>  
<mapping>  
<windowsDomain>domain</windowsDomain>   
<windowsUserId>WindowsUserName</windowsUserId>   
<externalApplication>Application name1</externalApplication>   
<externalUserId>App1UserName</externalUserId>   
</mapping>  
<mapping>  
<windowsDomain>domain</windowsDomain>   
<windowsUserId>WindowsUserName</windowsUserId>   
<externalApplication>Application name2</externalApplication>   
<externalUserId>App2UserName</externalUserId>   
</mapping>  
</sso>  
  
```  
  
 If a user account is changed, you must use this command to create a mapping for the new user account. You should also remove the old user mapping. For more information about removing a mapping, see [How to Delete User Mappings](../esso/how-to-delete-user-mappings.md).  
  
 After you create a user mapping, you must enable it before you can use this mapping in the Single Sign-On (SSO) system. For more information, see [How to Enable a User Mapping](../esso/how-to-enable-a-user-mapping.md).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Only domain groups are supported for user mappings.  
  
### To create user mappings using the administration utility  
  
1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type `cmd`, and then press ENTER.  
  
2.  At the command prompt, go to the Enterprise Single Sign-On installation directory.  
  
     The default installation directory is \<*drive*>:\Program Files\Common Files\Enterprise Single Sign-On.  
  
3.  Type `ssomanage –createmappings <mappings file name>`, where *\<mappings file name>* is the name of the file that contains the user mappings that you want to create.  
  
### To create user mappings using the client utility  
  
1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type `cmd`, and then press ENTER.  
  
2.  At the command prompt, go to the Enterprise Single Sign-On installation directory.  
  
     The default installation directory is \<*drive*>:\Program Files\Common Files\Enterprise Single Sign-On.  
  
3.  Type `ssoclient –setcredentials <application name >`, where *\<application name >* is the name of the affiliate application that the user wants to create a mapping for.
