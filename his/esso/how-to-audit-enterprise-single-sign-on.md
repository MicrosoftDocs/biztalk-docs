# How to Audit Enterprise Single Sign-On
Use this command to set both the positive and negative auditing levels. Single Sign-On (SSO) administrators can set the positive and negative audit levels that suit their corporate policies. You can set positive and negative audits to one of the following levels:  
  
-   0 = None  
  
-   1 = Low  
  
-   2 = Medium  
  
-   3 = High - This level issues as many audit messages as possible.  
  
 The default value for positive auditing is 0 (none), and the default value for negative auditing is 1(low).  
  
 To change the database-level auditing, you must update the Credential database using an XML file. The following is an example XML file that is used for updating the Credential database:  
  
```  
<sso>  
<globalnfo>  
<auditDeletedApps>1000</auditDeletedApps>  
<auditDeletedMappings>1000</auditDeletedMappings>  
<auditCredentialLookups>1000</auditCredentialLookups>  
</globalInfo>  
</sso>  
  
```

3.  Type `ssoconfig –auditlevel < positive level>``<negative level>`, where *\<positive level>* is the level of auditing when actions succeed, and *\<negative auditing>* is the level of auditing when actions fail.
