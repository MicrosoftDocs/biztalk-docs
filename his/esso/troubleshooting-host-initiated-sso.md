# Troubleshooting Host Initiated SSO
The primary method of troubleshooting host initiated Single Sign-On (SSO) is tracing.  
  
## Tracing  
 Use the Trace command-line utility to enable tracing in SSO.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  For the trace command to function, the file tracelog.exe must be in the following directory:  
>   
>  \<drive>:\Program Files\Common Files\Enterprise Single Sign-On.  
>   
>  You can download this file from the following location:  
>   
>  [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=33023](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=33023)  
  
#### To use the trace utility  
  
1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type `cmd`, and then click **OK**.  
  
2.  At the command prompt, go to the Enterprise Single Sign-On installation directory.  
  
     The default is \<drive>:\Program Files\Common Files\Enterprise Single Sign-On.  
  
3.  Type `Trace –start –high` to set the tracing level to high and begin the trace.  
  
4.  Run the scenario with host initiated SSO.  
  
5.  Type `Trace –stop` to end the trace.  
  
6.  A .bin file is generated in the directory above, which you can send to Microsoft for analysis.
