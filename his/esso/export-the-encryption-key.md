# Export the Encryption Key
If you are migrating from Host Integration Server 2000, you must export the encryption key. The encryption key is a security device that Host Integration Server 2000 uses to encrypt user passwords. It must be backed up because the migration utility will need it as part of the migration process.  
  
### To export the encryption key  
  
1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, and then type `cmd`.  
  
2.  Locate the Host Integration Server 2000 installation directory.  
  
3.  Type `udbkey /showkey >hostseckey.bak` to back up the key into a file.  
  
4.  Protect the file securely.
