# Upgrading from an Earlier Version of SSO
If you are installing the Enterprise Single Sign-on (SSO) feature, and you already have an earlier version deployed on your computer (for example, from [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] CTP, or Microsoft BizTalk Server), you must follow these steps.  
  
- Back up the SSODB to a secure location.  
  
- Back up the master secret key on the master secret server.  
  
- Update the master secret server by running [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] Setup, selecting **Custom Installation**, and then selecting **Enterprise Single Sign-On**. After selecting **Enable Enterprise Single Sign-On on this computer**, select **Join an existing SSO system**.  
  
  You do not have to update the other SSO servers (non-master secret servers) from your BizTalk Server installation. However, if you want the new Enterprise Single Sign-On features to be available on those servers, you must update them by using the same procedures outlined earlier.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  These considerations also apply if you are installing Microsoft BizTalk Server 2006 on a computer that has an existing installation of [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] Enterprise Single Sign-On, and you want to update the servers.
