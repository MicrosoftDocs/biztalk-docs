# Host Initiated Single Sign-On
Host-initiated Single Sign-On (SSO) enables a request from the host system to access a resource on a Windows system. The host system (for example, an RACF account) exists in a non-Windows environment and under the context of a non-Windows user. The Single Sign-On Credential Store maps host accounts to Windows accounts, enabling this access.  
  
 The following topics describe configuration that is specific to Host-initiated SSO.
