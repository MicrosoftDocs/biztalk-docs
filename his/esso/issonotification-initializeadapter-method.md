# ISSONotification.InitializeAdapter Method
Initializes the password sync adapter to the ENTSSO system.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp#  
  
HRESULT InitializeAdapter(  
BSTR strAdapterName,  
ULONG lFlags,  
ULONGLONG* hNotifyEvent,  
GUID* guidTrackingId);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `bstrAdapterName`  
 [in] The unique adapter name.  
  
 `ulFlags`  
 [in] A bitwise combination of the [SSO_NOTIFICATION_FLAG](../esso/sso-notification-flag-enumeration-com.md) values.  
  
 `phNotifyEvent`  
 [out] When this method returns, contains an event handle created by PS Helper. You should cast the return value to a HANDLE on return, as MIDL does not support the HANDLE data type. This parameter can be NULL if the event handle is not required by the adapter.  
  
 `pguidTrackingId`  
 [out] When this method returns, contains the tracking ID generated by ENTSSO. The tracking ID is used for auditing purposes. This parameter can be NULL if the tracking ID is not required by the adapter.  
  
## Return Value  
 This method returns an HRESULT indicating whether it completed correctly. For more information, see the Error Values section.  
  
## Error Values  
 This method returns an HRESULT containing one of the values in the following table.  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|The initialization was successful.|  
|S_FALSE|The initialization was successful, but was a reconnect. For more information, see the Remarks section.|  
|E_ACCESSDENIED|Access is denied.|  
|ENTSSO_E_NO_SERVER|Could not contact the ENTSSO server. Check that the ENTSSO service is running.|  
  
## Remarks  
 Before calling **InitializeAdapter**, you must have entered the relevant adapter name into ENTSSO.  
  
 **InitializeAdapter** should be the first method your adapter calls, because you cannot call any other **ISSONotification** methods before you call **InitializeAdapter**. You should not call **InitializeAdapter** again until after you call **ShutdownAdapter**. Once you shut down the adapter, however, you may call **InitializeAdapter** at any time to reconnect.  
  
 **InitializeAdapter** initiates communication between the PS Helper and the adapter. When your adapter calls **InitializeAdapter**, the PS Helper calls the Enterprise Single Sign-On (ENTSSO) service over encrypted LRPC. Using the adapter name, the ENTSSO service grants or denies access based on the access account that was defined for the current adapter.  
  
 You must have started the ENTSSO service before calling **InitializeAdapter**. PS Helper cannot automatically start ENTSSO because the adapter process might not be running with sufficient privileges to start a service. Therefore, your adapter must initiate all communication between the adapter and ENTSSO.  
  
 PS Helper first establishes a connection with the ENTSSO service, and then creates a named event. PS Helper then passes the named event to the ENTSSO service. ENTSSO uses the event signal to the PS Helper when a notification arrives for the adapter. ENTSSO returns the event to the adapter so that the adapter can wait on the event, or else ignore the event and allow PS Helper to wait instead. This gives more flexibility to the adapter for the adapter threading model. The event is valid for the adapter until ENTSSO completes the processing initiated by a call to **ShutdownAdapter**.  
  
 The ENTSSO service accepts the initial remote procedure call (RPC) call from the PS Helper if ENTSSO is running. ENTSSO then performs an access check. If ENTSSO is unable to access the database to obtain the adapter configuration information, then ENTSSO returns an E_ACCESSDENIED event. If ENTSSO has the adapter configuration information, but cannot currently contact the database, then ENTSSO continues to accept password change notifications and buffers the notifications locally and encrypt the notifications in a local temporary file.  
  
 **InitializeAdapter** also returns E_ACCESSDENIED if the adapter is deleted or disabled.  
  
 For all errors, more detailed information will be available in the Windows Event Log.  
  
 It is assumed that the adapter knows the appropriate name to use when communicating with ENTSSO.  
  
 **InitializeAdapter** is single-threaded. All other threads calling **InitializeAdapter** are blocked until **InitializeAdapter** has completed. It is also synchronized with the **ShutdownAdapter** method.  
  
 It is possible that the adapter process terminates before you can issue a **ShutdownAdapter**. In this case, and if ENTSSO receives another **InitializeAdapter** before ENTSSO receives a corresponding **ShutdownAdapter**, ENTSSO treats the second **ShutdownAdapter** call as a reconnect. In this case, ENTSSO cleans up and invalidates the existing event, and creates a new handle. ENTSSO also completes any pending **ReceiveNotifications** for the old event handle with a shutdown notification.  
  
 In the case of a reconnect, a new tracking ID is returned from the **InitializeAdapter**. ENTSSO returns a new tracking ID because the tracking ID returned from **InitializeAdapter** can be considered a session ID. Further, ENTSSO reissues any pending (but unconfirmed) notifications to the adapter.
