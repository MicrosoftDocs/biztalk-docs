# Adapter Programming Administration
An adapter is a special type of configuration store application: that is, an adapter is a component that shares a namespace with other Single Sign-On and configuration store applications. Therefore, you can access information about an adapter using ISSOConfigStore. But unlike a configuration store application, you do not perform administrative functions on an adapter with the ISSOAdmin interface. Instead, you administer an adapter through ISSOPSAdmin. The reason for a specialized adapter administration interface is so that the system can coordinate other activities with the configuration store.
