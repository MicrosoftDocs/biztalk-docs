# Managing User Mappings
This section provides information about how to create and configure the Enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) mappings.  
  
 Administrators use the **ssomanage** utility to manage mappings, and the application users use the **ssoclient** utility to manage their mappings.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Application administrators can manage mappings associated with affiliate applications for which they are an administrator, while SSO affiliate administrators and the SSO administrators can manage all mappings associated with all affiliate applications.
