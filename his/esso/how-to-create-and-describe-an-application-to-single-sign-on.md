# How to Create and Describe an Application to Single Sign-On
A common administrative task that you might need to perform is adding an affiliate application into the Enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) database. Adding an affiliate application to the Enterprise SSO database enables you to associate users and credentials with the affiliated application.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Creating an affiliated application requires membership in the "SSO Affiliate Administrator" account or above.  
  
### To create and describe an application in the SSO database  
  
1.  Create a new `ISSOAdmin` object.  
  
2.  Create a new application with a call to `ISSOAdmin.CreateApplication`.  
  
3.  Add the relevant fields describing the application with a call to `ISSOAdmin.CreateFieldInfo`.  
  
     During this step, you tell the database that an application has users and associated passwords.  
  
4.  Push the newly created description out to the server with a call to `ISSOAdmin.UpdateApplication` or `ISSOAdmin2.UpdateApplication2`.  
  
     The difference between the two methods is that `UpdateApplication2` uses an `IPropertyBag` as the way to describe the application updates, while `UpdateApplication` has multiple parameters.  
  
5.  Purge the local cache for the changes you made by calling `ISSOAdmin.PurgeCacheForApplication`.  
  
     Purging the local cache is a security measure that prevents having the names and passwords that you describe in step 3 to exist in an unsecured location.  
  
 The following example shows how to create an application and add field information.  
  
```  
public static bool AddApplication(string name, string admins, string users)  
    {  
       try  
       {  
          ISSOAdmin admin=new ISSOAdmin();  
          // Create application.  
          admin.CreateApplication(name, "SSO Sample Application", "administrator@ssoaffiliateapplication.com", users, admins, SSOFlag.SSO_WINDOWS_TO_EXTERNAL | SSOFlag.SSO_FLAG_ALLOW_TICKETS | SSOFlag.SSO_FLAG_VALIDATE_TICKETS, 2);  
          // Add fields.  
          admin.CreateFieldInfo(name, "User Id", SSOFlag.SSO_FLAG_NONE);  
          admin.CreateFieldInfo(name, "Password", SSOFlag.SSO_FLAG_FIELD_INFO_MASK);  
          // Enable application.  
          admin.UpdateApplication(name, null, null, null, null, SSOFlag.SSO_FLAG_ENABLED, SSOFlag.SSO_FLAG_ENABLED);  
          // Purge changes.  
          admin.PurgeCacheForApplication(name);  
       }  
       catch  
       {  
          return false;  
       }  
       return true;  
    }  
```
