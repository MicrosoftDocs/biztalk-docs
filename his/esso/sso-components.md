# SSO Components
The sub services of the Enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) service are as follows:  
  
-   **Mapping.** Maps the user account in the Windows system to the user accounts in the back-end systems (affiliate applications).  
  
-   **Lookup.** Looks up the user credentials in the Credential database in the back-end system. This is the SSO runtime component.  
  
-   **Administration.** Manages the affiliate applications and the mappings for each affiliate application.  
  
-   **Secret.** Generates the master secret and distributes it to the other SSO servers in the system. It is only active on the Single Sign-On server that is acting as the master secret server.  
  
-   **Password Synchronization.** Simplifies administration of the SSO credential database, and keeps passwords in sync across user directories.
