# How to Set the Enterprise SSO Server Using the Client Utility
Each time you use **ssoclient**, you must first point the user to the correct Single Sign-On (SSO) server that contains their configuration information.  
  
### To set the SSO Server for a user using the client utility  
  
1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type `cmd`, and then press ENTER.  
  
2.  At the command prompt, go to the Enterprise Single Sign-On installation directory.  
  
     The default installation directory is *\<drive>*:\Program Files\Common Files\Enterprise Single Sign-On.  
  
3.  Type `ssoclient â€“server <Single Sign-On Server>`, where *\<Single Sign-On Server>* is the name of the Single Sign-On server that the user wants to connect to.
