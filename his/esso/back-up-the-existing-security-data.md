# Back up the Existing Security Data
For safety purposes, you should back up your existing security data before you migrate to Enterprise Single Sign-On.  
  
 For information about how to do this, see the documentation for your particular product version (for example, Host Integration Server 2000 or SNA Server 4.0).
