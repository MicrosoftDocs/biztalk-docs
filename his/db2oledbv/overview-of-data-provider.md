# Overview of Data Provider
The Microsoft OLE DB Provider for DB2 (Data Provider) lets you create distributed applications targeting IBM DB2 databases. The Data Provider takes advantage of Microsoft SQL Server data access architecture together with a Microsoft network client for DB2 that functions as a Distributed Relational Database Architecture (DRDA) application requester. The Data Provider converts Microsoft Component Object Model (COM) OLE DB commands and data types to DRDA protocol code points and data formats.  
  
## Data Provider Features  
 The Data Provider offers the following features:  
  
- Installation using an interactive and scriptable program.  
  
- Support for Windows 32-bit x86 and 64-bit x64 operating systems.  
  
- Compatibility with SQL Server, SQL Server Data Tools, and SQL Server PowerPivot  
  
- Access to DB2 server computers across a TCP/IP network connection.  
  
- Execution of DB2 dynamic SQL commands within remote unit of work transactions.  
  
- Tools for creating, testing, modifying and storing data source definitions.  
  
- A trace utility for recording flows and commands to enable troubleshooting of problems.  
  
- Help through on-line user documentation.  
  
  The Data Provider is designed and tested for use with multiple versions of Microsoft SQL Server and SQL Server Data Tools. The Data Provider is based on technology in Microsoft Host Integration Server (HIS). For more information about Microsoft HIS, see [Microsoft HIS Documentation](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=799230).
