# Release Notes

These release notes summarize the most important issues in [!INCLUDE[his2016](../includes/his2016-md.md)].  
  
## Software  
 A single Microsoft Installer (MSI) file contains the server software. You can download the software from the [Microsoft TechNet evaluation center](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/).  
  
## Upgrade  
 You cannot do an in-place upgrade to HIS 2016.  You must uninstall all existing copies of Host Integration Server, and then install HIS 2016.  A [HIS migration tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=54950) is available to assist in upgrading from previous versions of HIS. [HIS Migration Tool](../install-and-config-guides/his-migration-tool.md) has more details.
  
## Installation  
 The setup installation is a new simple wizard that installs the software, and also has an optional advanced dialog to select (install) or de-select (uninstall) features.  
  
## Configuration  
 The post-installation configuration is a new set of simple dialogs that configure the features, and also has advanced settings to (enable) or un-configure (disable) sub-features.  
  
 Configuration is required to use most features, including services, adapters, and tools.  
  
## 32-bit and 64-bit  
 You cannot install HIS 2016 on a 32-bit x86 only operating system. The setup installation supports 64-bit x64 operating systems. It installs features and tools to use side-by-side on x64 and x86 systems. For example, set up the installation and configuration so that you enable BizTalk Adapters to run in both a BizTalk Server 64-bit and 32-bit host application.  
  
## Client  
 The setup installation installs the server side-by-side with the client. The installation does not provide the client as a stand-alone option. The HIS team is developing a client-only MSI for x86 and x64 operating systems, which will be available at retail release.  
  
## Telemetry  
 HIS 2016 includes technology for telemetry and error reporting. The HIS product team utilizes this data to improve the quality, reliability, and performance of [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)].  Ths includes:
