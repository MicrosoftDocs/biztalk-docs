# Installing HIS 2016
This installation guide provides basic instructions for using the [!INCLUDE[his2016](../install-and-config-guides/includes/his2016-md.md)] setup installation and configuration.

## Installation  
  
1.  Double-click the **HIS2016_Server_EN.msi** file.  
  
2.  In the **License Agreement**, accept the **End User License Agreement**. To customize your installation (optional):

## Unattended Installation
