# HIS Designer Views
The Host Integration Server Designer (HIS Designer) development tool uses a two-pane user interface. The left pane displays a tree view, and the right pane displays a list view, or **Details** view. The tree view displays a hierarchical representation of the contents of the library. The list view displays a compact subset of the selected type library component’s properties that are displayed in the property browser. You might find it useful to customize the details view by using something other than a list. For example, a COBOL, RPG, or IDL view might be more useful.  
  
## Tree View  
 The tree view contains the following elements:  
  
 .NET Library  
  
 Methods  
  
 Method1  
  
 Parameter1  
  
 Parameter2  
  
 …  
  
 Parameter(n)  
  
 Method2  
  
 …  
  
 Method(n)  
  
 Data tables for .NET Framework libraries  
  
 DataTable1  
  
 DataTable Column1  
  
 DataTable Column2  
  
 …  
  
 DataTable Column(n)  
  
 Structures for .NET Framework libraries  
  
 Structure1  
  
 Structure Member1  
  
 Structure Member2  
  
 …  
  
 Structure Member(n)  
  
 Unions  
  
 Union1  
  
 Union Member1  
  
 Union Member2  
  
## Details View  
 The details view displays context-sensitive information about the item that is selected in the tree view. The details view displays a subset of the properties of that type library component. These properties are displayed in columns labeled in a context-sensitive manner.  
  
 The detail views include the following:  
  
 Interface view  
  
 Method view  
  
 Parameter view  
  
 DataTables view  
  
 DataTable view  
  
 DataTable column view  
  
 Structures view  
  
 Structure view  
  
 Structure member view  
  
 Unions view  
  
 Union view  
  
 Union member view
