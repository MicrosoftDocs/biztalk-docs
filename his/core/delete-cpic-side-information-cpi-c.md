# Delete_CPIC_Side_Information (CPI-C)
The **Delete_CPIC_Side_Information** call (function name **xcmdsi**) deletes an entry from the side information table in memory. The side information entry is identified through the symbolic destination name.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
CM_ENTRY Delete_CPIC_Side_Information(Â   
  unsigned char FAR *key_lock,         
    unsigned char FAR *sym_dest_name,    
    CM_INT32 FAR *return_code            
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *key_lock*  
 Supplied parameter. This parameter is ignored.  
  
 *sym_dest_name*  
 Supplied parameter. Specifies the symbolic destination name of the entry to be deleted.  
  
 *return_code*  
 The code returned from this call. The valid return codes are listed later in this topic.  
  
## Return Codes  
 CM_OK  
 Primary return code; the call executed successfully.  
  
 CM_PROGRAM_PARAMETER_CHECK  
 Primary return code; the *sym_dest_name* parameter specified a nonexistent side information entry.  
  
 CM_PRODUCT_SPECIFIC_ERROR

-   [Extract_CPIC_Side_Information](../core/extract-cpic-side-information-cpi-c.md)
