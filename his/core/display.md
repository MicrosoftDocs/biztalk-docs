# DISPLAY
The **DISPLAY** verb returns configuration information and current operating values for the SNA node.  
  
 It is recommended that you use the [GetAppcConfig](../core/getappcconfig.md) Windows extension function to obtain system configuration information relating to APPC LUs. Users of 5250 emulators, in particular, should use the **GetAPPCConfig** Windows extension.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Because of the nature of client/server architecture, the implementation of the **DISPLAY** verb on [!INCLUDE[hishostintegrationserver2009](../core/includes/hishostintegrationserver2009-md.md)] contains important differences from the IBM Extended Services for OS/2 version 1.0 (IBM ES for OS/2 version 1.0) on which it was based.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  For applications that use the APPC **DISPLAY** verb in IBM ES for OS/2 version 1.0 compatibility mode and that do not use the Host Integration Server extensions for enumerating all active servers and connections, Host Integration Server will randomly choose a default **DISPLAY** connection, unless a specific default **DISPLAY** connection has been configured in SNA Manager. This connection is used as the basis for all **DISPLAY** requests. For information about specifying the default **DISPLAY** connection, see [!INCLUDE[hishostintegrationserver2009](../core/includes/hishostintegrationserver2009-md.md)] Help.

## Return Codes  
 AP_OK  
 Primary return code; the verb executed successfully.  
  
 AP_PARAMETER_CHECK  
 Primary return code; the verb did not execute because of a parameter error.  
  
 AP_DISPLAY_INVALID_CONSTANT  
 Secondary return code; the value supplied for NUM_SECTIONS or INIT_SEC_LEN is invalid.  
  
 AP_STATE_CHECK  
 Primary return code; the verb did not execute because it was issued in an invalid state.  
  
 AP_DISPLAY_INFO_EXCEEDS_LEN  
 Secondary return code; the returned **DISPLAY** information did not fit in the buffer.  
  
 AP_INVALID_DATA_SEGMENT  
 Secondary return code; the segment containing the data buffer is too small for the specified data length.  
  
 AP_COMM_SUBSYSTEM_ABENDED  
 Primary return code; indicates one of the following conditions:  
  
 The node used by this conversation has encountered an ABEND.  
  
 The connection between the TP and the node type 2.1 has been broken (a LAN error).  
  
 The SnaBase at the TPs computer has encountered an ABEND.  
  
 AP_COMM_SUBSYSTEM_NOT_LOADED  
 Primary return code; a required component could not be loaded or terminated while processing the verb. Thus, communication could not take place. Contact the system administrator for corrective action.  
  
 AP_INVALID_VERB_SEGMENT  
 Primary return code; the VCB extended beyond the end of the data segment.  
  
 AP_STACK_TOO_SMALL  
 Primary return code; the stack size of the application is too small to execute the verb. Increase the stack size of your application.  
  
 AP_UNEXPECTED_DOS_ERROR  
 Primary return code; the operating system has returned an error to APPC while processing an APPC call from the local TP. The operating system return code is returned through the **secondary_rc**. It appears in Intel byte-swapped order. If the problem persists, consult the system administrator.  
  
## Remarks  
 **DISPLAY** identifies an LU by alias alone. If the same local LU alias is used multiple times in a domain (for backup or other purposes) and that LU alias is specified through **DISPLAY**, the verb can flow to a different LU than the one intended.  
  
 For the **DISPLAY** verb to return successfully, a specific connection must be defined in the SNA Manager program **Display Verb** dialog box. IBM originally defined the **DISPLAY** verb with the IBM OS/2 Extended Edition product which assumed a single connection. However, because Host Integration Server supports multiple connections, the specific connection associated with the **DISPLAY** verb must be configured.  
  
 The **DISPLAY** verb requires a user-supplied buffer for the return of system information. If the buffer is not large enough, APPC returns the AP_DISPLAY_INFO_EXCEEDS_LEN return code, along with the size actually needed at the time of the request (in the **area_needed** parameter). One possible strategy for the use of this verb follows:  
  
-   If the **buffer_len** value is less than the **area_needed** value returned by APPC, and the required length is less than 64 kilobytes (KB), then increase the size of the display buffer to equal or greater than the **area_needed** value.  
  
-   If the **area_needed** value is greater than 64KB, you can choose to request each information section individually. Or, you can take the following steps:  
  
    1.  Process the information sections with complete information, whose total number displayed equals the total actual number.  
  
    2.  Choose a subset of the information sections you requested that contains incomplete information, and reissue the verb requesting those information sections.  
  
    3.  Repeat steps a and b as needed.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If an individual information section is greater than 64 KB, then you cannot get all of the requested information from APPC.  
  
 The **DISPLAY** verb should not be executed from different threads of the same process, since it is not thread-safe.  
  
 The **DISPLAY** verb returns AP_DISPLAY_INVALID_CONSTANT if the following values are not set for the supplied parameters for **init_sect_len** and **num_sections**:  
  
||NS/2 format|IBM EE format|NS/2 format (Windows only)|IBM EE format (Windows only)|  
|------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|  
|**init_sect_len**|50|44|52|48|  
|**num_sections**|16|9|16|9|  
  
 The AP_DISPLAY_INVALID_CONSTANT is also returned when the following parameters are not set properly:  
  
-   **reserv2** must be set to NULL.  
  
-   **am_info** must be set to AP_NO.  
  
-   **tp_info** must be set to AP_NO.  
  
-   **adapter_info** must be set to AP_NO if NS/2 format is requested.  
  
-   **ms_info** must be set to AP_NO if NS/2 format is requested.
