# Macros
The 3270 Client provides macros for ease in using host function keys.  
  
 To use a macro, select the correct macro from the Macro menu. The appropriate function key is sent to the host.  
  
 The following table shows the macros for the 3270 Client:

|Reset|Sends a Reset key to the host. Reset unlocks the keyboard and clears operator errors.|  
|Sys Request|Sends a Sys Req key to the host. With most systems, use this macro to notify the host system that the display station is ready to select a new program or activity.|
