# Configuring Certificates
The **TN3270 Server properties** dialog box contains a **Port/Security** tab, which allows you to configure the ports to be available to the TN3270 server. The security parameters are then configured on a port-by-port basis.  
  
 The following issues are required to implement security support:  
  
-   A client that attempts to connect to a port that has not been configured on the TN3270 server will be unsuccessful.  
  
-   The default port defined in SNA Manager does not affect the security configuration. Either a port security record is found (in which case it is used), or it is not found (in which case the client fails to connect).  
  
-   A port with security level Unsecured means that TLS/SSL will be fully disabled on that port. There will be no exchange of certificates on that port.  
  
-   All the changes made to the configuration are dynamic.  
  
-   Server authentication certificates may not be dynamically changed.
