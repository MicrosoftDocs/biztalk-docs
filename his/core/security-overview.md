# Security Overview
As corporate networks become increasingly integrated with the Internet and other external networks, the threat of unauthorized access to your corporate resources grows significantly. When you plan your networking environment, you must strike a balance between protecting your resources and allowing users unobstructed access to data.  
  
 The following list includes some of the questions that must be answered as you prepare to secure your [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../core/includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] environment:  
  
-   How can I authenticate users who require host resources?  
  
-   How can I control access to host resources?  
  
-   How can I control sensitive data flowing between workstations and host applications?  
  
-   How can I maintain security while connecting my host network to external sources like the Internet?  
  
-   How can I make host resources easier to access for authenticated users, yet maintain a more secure and easy-to-administer host environment?  
  
 This section helps answer these questions and describes how to implement the security features to create a more secure LAN-to-host environment.
