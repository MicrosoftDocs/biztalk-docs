# Supported Features
This topic lists the features that are supported over the IP-DLC link service.  
  
## Base SNA Features  
 The following existing [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../core/includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] SNA features are supported over the IP-DLC link service:  
  
-   LU types 0, 1, 2, 3 and 6.2 (dependent and independent)  
  
-   LUA, FMI, APPC, and CPI-C APIs  
  
-   Dynamically Defined Dependent LUs (DDDLUs)  
  
-   Dynamic addition of local LUs, remote LUs, and connections  
  
-   Incoming and outgoing calls  
  
-   Connection Activation at Server startup, on demand or by administrator  
  
-   SNA data compression  
  
-   PU concentration with the upstream link over IP-DLC  
  
 Because the preceding SNA features are supported, it follows that the following applications are also supported over the IP-DLC link service:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../core/includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)]-compatible 3270 emulators  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../core/includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)]-compatible 5250 emulators  
  
-   APPC - 3270 Session Viewer (including the LU-LU Test feature)  
  
-   Host Print Service  
  
-   Data Integration Services (data providers for DB2 and host files)  
  
-   Local and remote administration  
  
-   TN3270 server  
  
-   TN5250 server  
  
-   Session Integrator  
  
-   Message Integration (WCF Channel for WebSphere MQ)  
  
-   Application Integration Transaction Integrator  
  
-   BizTalk Adapters  
  
## Fault Tolerance Features  
 Note that because the IP-DLC link service uses the APPN and HPR/IP protocols, it is automatically able to take advantage of the following fault tolerance features:  
  
-   Ability to reroute sessions around a failure in the network provided that an alternative route exists.  
  
-   Ability for mainframe applications to be moved to a different processor with little or no impact to users when system or application failures occur on the mainframe.  
  
## Security Features  
 Because the IP-DLC link service uses UDP/IP, the Windows IPsec feature can be used to provide end-to-end data security over the IP-DLC link service. Windows handles configuration of IPsec independently. No specific configuration is required for the IP-DLC link service.  
  
## Diagnostic Features  
 The diagnostics provided by the IP-DLC link service are used through the [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../core/includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] Tracer Initiator and Trace Viewer facilities.
