# Welcome to the Object Wizard Page (WIP)
Use the **Welcome to the Object Wizard** page to view the definition of a metadata file (.tlb for COM, .dll for .Net) and to control whether the welcome page is displayed again the next time the wizard is used.  
  
|Use this|To do this|  
|--------------|----------------|  
|**Do not show this welcome page again.**|Select this option if you will be using the wizard more than once and do not want to read the introduction each time the wizard is launched. Each time the wizard is launched, the welcome page will be hidden and the wizard will begin with the second page. To view the welcome page again, click **Back** on the second page of the wizard.|
