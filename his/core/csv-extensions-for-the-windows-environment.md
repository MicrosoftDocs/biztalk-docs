# CSV Extensions for the Windows Environment
This section describes API extensions to the Windows® Common Service Verb (CSV) API. Windows CSV allows multithreaded Microsoft® Windows-based processes. Multithreading is the running of several processes in rapid sequence within a single program. A process contains one or more threads of execution. All references to threads in this document refer to actual threads in multithreaded Windows environments.  
  
 For each extension, this section provides a definition of the function, syntax, returns, and remarks for using the function.  
  
 This section contains:  
  
-   [WinAsyncCSV](../core/winasynccsv.md)  
  
-   [WinCSVCleanup](../core/wincsvcleanup.md)  
  
-   [WinCSVStartup](../core/wincsvstartup.md)
