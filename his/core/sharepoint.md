# SharePoint
SharePoint in Office 2010 provides self-service access to information by providing a powerful set of features that allow business users to create and share analysis and data from their desktops or a browser. It enables people to access and respond to information securely from virtually anywhere with confidence that content changes and fidelity are maintained across locations and devices.  
  
 The combination of Office and SharePoint empower end users by providing both read and write access to line-of-business (LOB) applications and external data sources. You can now access back-end data and business processes through familiar Office applications with no additional training, facilitating the reach of LOB data across the organization.
