# SNA Internationalization Programmer&#39;s Guide
This section describes the features available in [!INCLUDE[hishostintegrationserver2009](../core/includes/hishostintegrationserver2009-md.md)] for supporting international languages and different national language character sets.  
  
 The SNANLS API uses the language support features provided with Windows. SNANLS supports European languages that use single-byte encoding, as well as East Asian languages that use double-byte or Unicode encoding.  
  
 For API references and other technical information about SNA Internationalization, see [SNA Internationalization Programmer's Reference](../Topic/SNA%20Internationalization%20Programmer's%20Reference1.md).
