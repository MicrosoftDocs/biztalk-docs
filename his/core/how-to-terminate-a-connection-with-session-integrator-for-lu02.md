# How to Terminate a Connection with Session Integrator for LU0
After you finish sending and receiving information over the LU0 session, you must terminate your connection. Ending a session with Session Integrator consists primarily of calling `SessionLU0.Disconnect`.  
  
### To terminate a connection with Session Integrator for LU0  
  
1.  End the connection by using `SessionLU0.Disconnect`.

// Go back to the original state of buttons.  
  SetOpeningState();  
  }  
```
