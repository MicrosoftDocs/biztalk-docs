# RQR and CLEAR
An application using Transmission Service profile (TS profile) 4 can request the session to be recovered by sending **Status-Control(RQR)**. The local node presents this to the host as an **RQR** request. Note that, if the application has received a critical [Status-Acknowledge(Nack-2)](../Topic/Status-Acknowledge\(Nack-2\)1.md), this option cannot be taken because the local node will send a [Close(PLU) Request](../Topic/Close\(PLU\)%20Request1.md) immediately following the **Status-Acknowledge(Nack-2)** to the application, and the primary logical unit (PLU) connection will no longer be valid. The **RQR** message requests the host to reset the session by sending a **CLEAR** request, as shown in the following figure.  
  
 The receipt of **CLEAR** causes the application to reset its session state to that following the **BIND**, the **Open(PLU)**.  
  
 Another way for the application to deal with error conditions is to ask for an **UNBIND** by sending **Status-Control(RSHUTD)**. (For more information, see [Application-Initiated Termination](../core/application-initiated-termination.md).) Note that this may not require the host to supply a new **BIND**, depending on the host configuration. A new SSCP request may be required (such as **LOGON**).  
  
 In the following figure, the application requests recovery by issuing **Status-Control(RQR)**. The host sends **CLEAR**, and the application must reset its session to state that it was following the **BIND (Open(PLU)**). In this case, the application is now between brackets and awaiting start data traffic (SDT).
