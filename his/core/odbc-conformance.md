# ODBC Conformance
Microsoft ODBC Driver for DB2 enables access over SNA LU 6.2 and TCP/IP networks to remote DB2 databases. This driver is implemented as an IBM Distributed Relational Database Architecture (DRDA) application requester that can connect to most DRDA-compliant DB2 systems, including z/OS, z/OS, IBM System i, AIX RS/6000, and Microsoft Windows.  
  
 You can use the driver interactively or from an application program to issue SQL statements and execute DB2 stored procedures. From Microsoft Office Excel, users can import DB2 tables into worksheets and use Excel graphing tools to analyze the data. From Microsoft Office Access, users can import from and export to DB2. Using Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), developers can publish DB2-stored information to users through a Web browser interface.
