# Office
Organizations face a broad set of business challenges that database technologies address, from running mission-critical applications to enabling the productivity of business users tracking personal and team-specific data. Information Technology (IT) groups often lack the staff and resources to solve all these problems. Microsoft Office productivity applications empower business users to solve their own problems without relying on IT assistance while enabling IT professionals to access and integrate data across their enterprise organization.  
  
 Microsoft provides a rich set of complementary technologies, including SQL Server, SharePoint Server, and Visual Studio, that address the varied and changing data management needs of organizations. Each of these technologies has features to address a range of user/developer/administrator roles, and the products are engineered to interoperate and interconnect. Host Integration Server empowers enterprise developers to deliver new applications more quickly and with less custom coding.  
  
 The topics in this section describe the features and functionality in Excel and SharePoint that enable enterprise organizations to integrate existing IBM host systems, programs, messages and data to create new applications that empower line-of-business users without requiring extensive coding.
