# Protect the Local File System, Database, and Registry
To prevent an attacker from spoofing their identity, accessing restricted data, or tampering with the data, you should do the following:  
  
-   Place the computer that is running Transaction Integrator (TI) in a secure location.  
  
-   Confirm that the access permissions to TI programs, TI components, and the registry are set correctly.  
  
-   Use host-initiated Single Sign-On (SSO) in conjunction with valid host UID and PWD passed in the initial connection flows.  
  
-   Use a secure network connection (for example, CICS TRM over IPsec-protected TCP/IP network connection).  
  
 You can also help mitigate this threat with the following deployment scenarios:  
  
-   Host-initiated SSO  
  
 You can learn more about this threat by reading about the following:  
  
-   How to help secure remote access to SQL Server (for example, integrated Windows security)  
  
-   How to send a valid host user ID  
  
-   How to send a valid host password
