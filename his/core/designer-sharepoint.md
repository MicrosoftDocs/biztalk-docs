# Designer (SharePoint)
The SharePoint Designer provides a graphical user interface that you can use for designing SharePoint sites and end-user workflows. SharePoint Designer also allows you to manipulate data from SharePoint as well as external data sources without coding directly against the .NET Framework.  
  
 With SharePoint Designer 2010, you can build complete, rich, reusable, process-centric applications on the SharePoint platform that integrate external data. SharePoint Designer 2010 makes it possible to build composite applications by configuring or designing components such as data sources, lists, content types, views, forms, workflows, and external content types without writing any code.  
  
 For more information, see [Getting Started with SharePoint Designer 2010](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=198249) (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=198249).
