# Conversation Security
You can use conversation security to require that the invoking TP provide a user identifier and password before APPC will allocate a conversation with the invokable TP. If security is activated, the invoking TP must supply a combination of the user identifier and password as parameters of [ALLOCATE](./allocate2.md) or [MC_ALLOCATE](./mc-allocate2.md). Conversation security is activated and configured through registry or environment variables on the computer where the invokable TP is located.  
  
 With communication involving more than two TPs, the verification of a user identifier and password can be passed from one TP to another. Suppose that TP A invokes TP B, which requires security information, and TP B in turn invokes TP C, which also requires security information. Through **ALLOCATE** or **MC_ALLOCATE**, TP B can inform TP C that conversation security has already been verified.  
  
 For information about the registry or environment variables affecting conversation security, see [Configuring Invokable TPs](../core/configuring-invokable-tps1.md).
