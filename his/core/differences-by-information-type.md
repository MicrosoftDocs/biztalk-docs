# Differences by Information Type
Differences in the implementation of the **DISPLAY** verb between [!INCLUDE[hishostintegrationserver2009](../core/includes/hishostintegrationserver2009-md.md)] and IBM ES for OS/2 are described in this section by information type. For each information type, there is a topic that describes:  
  
-   The information defined by IBM ES for OS/2 version 1.0.  
  
-   The information returned by Host Integration Server.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Host Integration Server does not support all of the information types supported by IBM ES for OS/2 version 1.0. If an information type is not listed in this section, it is not supported by Host Integration Server.
