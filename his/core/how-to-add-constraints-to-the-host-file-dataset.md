# How to Add Constraints to the Host File Dataset
The `HostFileDataAdapter.Fill method` fills a `DataSet` object with table columns and rows from a data source; though constraints are commonly set by the data source, the `Fill` method does not add this schema information to the `DataSet` object by default. To populate a `DataSet` object with existing primary key constraint information from a data source, you can call `HostFileDataAdapter.FillSchema`.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If a `column` in a data source is identified as auto-incrementing, the `FillSchema` method, or the `Fill` method with a `MissingSchemaAction` of `AddWithKey`, creates a `DataColumn` that has an `AutoIncrement` property set to `true`. However, you must set the `AutoIncrementStep` and `AutoIncrementSeed` values yourself.  
  
### To populate a dataset with additional key constraints  
  
1.  Call `HostFileDataAdapter.FillSchema`, using the targeted `DataSet` and Schema that contains the specified key constraints.  
  
     Adding schema information to a `DataSet` before filling it with data ensures that primary key constraints are included with the `DataTable` objects in the `DataSet` object. As a result, when additional calls to fill the `DataSet` are made, the primary key column information is used to match new rows from the data source with current rows in each `DataTable` object, and current data in the tables is overwritten with data from the data source. Without the schema information, the new rows from the data source are appended to the `DataSet` object, resulting in duplicate rows.
