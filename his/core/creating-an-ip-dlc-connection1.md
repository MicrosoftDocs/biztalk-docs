# Creating an IP-DLC Connection
You create and configure an IP-DLC link service connection as you would create any other link service connection.  
  
### To create an IP-DLC connection  
  
1. In the scope pane of the [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] MMC snap-in, locate the computer on which you want to create the IP-DLC link service connection.  
  
2. Under that computer, expand **SNA Service**.  
  
3. Right-click the **Connections** folder under that computer.  
  
4. On the context menu, click **New**, and then click **IP-DLC**.  
  
5. To configure the new link service connection, follow the steps for [Configuring an IP-DLC Connection](./configuring-an-ip-dlc-connection2.md).
