# How to Clear Event Logs
In Windows, you can clear the event logs by selecting **Clear all Events** on the **Action** menu after selecting the appropriate log file. You have the option of saving the event log before you clear it.  
  
### To clear event logs  
  
1.  Click **Start**, and point to **Programs**.  
  
2.  Point to **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Event Viewer**.  
  
3.  Select the appropriate log file (**Application**, **Security**, **System**, **Directory Service**, or **File Replication Service**).  
  
4.  Click the **Action** menu, and then click **Clear all Events**.  
  
5.  You will be prompted to save the file.
