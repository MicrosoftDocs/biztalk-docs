# LPI Connections
Partners communicate by passing messages to each other. If two partners want to communicate with each other, a locality partner index (LPI) connection is set up between the two partners. Messages then flow between the partners over this connection. The term LPI connection is explained in [LPI Addresses](../core/lpi-addresses.md). Note that this is not related to the MicrosoftÂ® Host Integration Server concept of a connection between the local node and a remote system.
