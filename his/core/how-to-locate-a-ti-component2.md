# How to Locate a TI Component
The more remote environments (RE) that you have configured, the more difficult it can be to locate a specific Transaction Integrator (TI) component in TI Manager's console tree. You can, however, easily locate a specific component without expanding all the REs in the console tree.  
  
### To locate a specific TI component  
  
1.  Start TI Manager, right-click **Transaction Integrator** in the console tree, and click **Find Component**.  
  
2.  In the list, click the name of the component that you want to locate, and then click **OK**.  
  
     The console tree shows the remote environment with which the component is associated.
