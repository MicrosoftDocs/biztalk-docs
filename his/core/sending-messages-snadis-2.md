# Sending Messages (SNADIS)
The SNALink should build a message in a buffer, and then call the Base to send it. The message contains source and destination LPIs, which are set up when the connection is opened. For more information, see [LPI Connections](../core/lpi-connections-snadis-2.md).  
  
 The SNALink can either obtain a new buffer to contain the message to be sent (using [SNAGetBuffer](./snagetbuffer1.md)) or reuse one in which it has previously received a message. The application is responsible for any buffer that it has obtained or in which it has received a message. It must either use (or reuse) the buffer to send a message or release it (using [SNAReleaseBuffer](./snareleasebuffer1.md)). If a buffer to be reused does not contain the correct number of elements for the message to be sent, the application can obtain additional elements (using [SNAGetElement](./snagetelement1.md)) or release existing ones (using [SNAReleaseElement](./snareleaseelement1.md)). It is the applications responsibility to maintain the **numelts** field in the message header.  
  
 The function used to send a message to the node is [SNASendMessage](./snasendmessage1.md).
