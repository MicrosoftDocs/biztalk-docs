# SNALink Configuration Information
The configuration information for all SNALinks on a computer is stored hierarchically, referenced by the SNALink name.  
  
 The entry for each SNALink must include certain fields that are required by the [!INCLUDE[hishostintegrationserver2009](../core/includes/hishostintegrationserver2009-md.md)] system. These are listed in the following table.  
  
|Required field|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|TYPE|The type of the SNALink. Acceptable values for TYPE are: SDLC, X25, TOKENRING, TCPIP, FRAMERELAY, CHANNEL, ISDN, ETHERNET.|  
|LINKMODULE|The name of the IHV DLL that provides the protocol code.|  
  
 The remainder of the configuration information consists of entries of the form PARAMETER = VALUE. Parameters can be set to either an integer or a string.  
  
 Examples of possible parameters that may be required by an SNALink are as follows:  
  
-   PortNumber = 3  
  
-   LineType = SWITCHED  
  
-   L3PacketSize = 128  
  
-   T1Timeout = 30  
  
 Note that to support more than one port on a multiport adapter, you must define multiple SNALinks. It is not possible to configure a single SNALink to support more than one physical link.  
  
 The following figure shows a sample configuration for a computer with two SNALinksâ€”SDLC1 and X25HOST.

 The configuration information is accessed using API calls that Host Integration Server provides.  
  
 The IHV Setup utility must write the configuration information for each SNALink supported. See [Setup Information (SNADIS)](../core/setup-information-snadis.md) for information about how this should be performed.
