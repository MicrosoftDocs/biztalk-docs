# RH Usage Errors (Category X&#39;40&#39;)
These sense codes indicate that fields in the request/response header (RH) are contrary to SNA rules or previously selected BIND options and prevent the intended half-session from receiving the request.  
  
 The checks 400A and 4012 are also performed. These do not permit negative responses because they apply to no-response sessions and responses, respectively.  
  
 The following codes are in this category.  
  
|Code|Meaning|  
|----------|-------------|  
|4006|Exception response not allowed|  
|4007|Definite response not allowed|  
|400F|Incorrect use of format indicator|  
|4011|Incorrect specification of RU category|  
|4014|Incorrect use of DR1, DR2, ER|
