# Invoking and Working with Invokable TPs (CPI-C)
There are two kinds of transaction programs (TPs): TPs that can invoke (that is, initiate a conversation with) other TPs, and TPs that can be invoked. A TP that can invoke another TP is called an invoking TP, and a TP that can be invoked is called an invokable TP.  

 The following topics describe how:  

- Invoking TPs request invokable TPs.  

- Invokable TPs identify themselves to the SNA service in preparation for being invoked.  

- An invokable TP is matched to an invoking TP's request.  

  For information about how to configure logical units (LUs) to support TPs, see [Configuring Host Integration Server to Support TPs](../core/configuring-host-integration-server-to-support-tps-cpi-c-1.md).
