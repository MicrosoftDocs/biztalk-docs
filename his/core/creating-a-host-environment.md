# Creating a Host Environment
A host environment (HE) defines the network and hardware characteristics of the non-Windows host that will initiate requests to the Windows operating system. For example, a host that uses the TCP/IP protocol to initiate requests to Windows is identified to host-initiated processing (HIP) through an HE that contains the IP address of the host and the code page that the host uses to represent its data.  
  
 You can use the **New Host Environment Wizard** to create a new host environment.
