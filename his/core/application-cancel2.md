# Application CANCEL
One of the parameters on the [Open(PLU) OK Response](./open-plu-oresponse2.md), which the application sends to the local node, specifies whether the application generates **CANCEL** (or **EC**) to terminate an inbound chain that has received a negative response. If this option is not selected, the local node generates a **CANCEL** request when it receives a negative response from the host to an incomplete chain.
