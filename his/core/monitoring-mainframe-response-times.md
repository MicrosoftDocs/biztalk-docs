# Monitoring Mainframe Response Times
The IBM response time monitor (RTM) measures the length of time it takes for a host to respond to an incoming 3270 end-user request. Responding to customer requests is a good indication of system performance. Monitoring the response time can be helpful diagnosing network and other system problems. RTM is a feature that works in conjunction with NetView on the mainframe. It gathers data from 3270 terminal emulators and sends the information to the host through the NetView connection for collection and analysis. Then you can view a graphical display of response times for a particular 3270 emulation session.
