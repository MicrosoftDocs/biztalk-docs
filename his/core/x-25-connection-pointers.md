# X.25 Connection Pointers
An X.25 connection uses a packet-switching network, and communicates through the Qualified Logical Link Control (QLLC) protocol. Connections are configured through SNA Manager. The steps for configuring an X.25 connection are described in detail in [Important Connection Information](../Topic/Important%20Connection%20Information1.md). The following pointers indicate items that require special attention:  
  
-   As with all connections, the identifiers must be configured correctly. For details, see [Settings to Check for All Connection Types](../core/settings-to-check-for-all-connection-types.md).  
  
-   Pay close attention to the **Remote X.25 Address** on the **Address** tab of the **Connection Properties** dialog box; it should match the address of the remote host, peer, or downstream system. The address consists of from 1 through 15 hexadecimal digits. If a 15-digit address is used, the final 3 digits are used for routing between stations with the same 12-digit address. For connections to a host using VTAM, the address should match the DIALNO parameter in the PORT definition. For connections to an AS/400, the address should match the local address of the AS/400 (assigned by the X.25 carrier).  
  
-   Check the Max BTU Length setting, found in the **Connection Properties** dialog box. A BTU is a data-link information frame.  
  
-   Set the Max BTU Length so that it matches the capacity of the adapter and the host or downstream system. Otherwise, when the mainframe or AS/400 sends a logon screen, the BTU length (frame size) that is used will be unworkable, causing the connection to be dropped. The following table provides guidelines:  
  
    |For...|Set the Max BTU Length to...|  
    |------------|----------------------------------|  
    |IBM SDLC adapter|521 or less.|  
    |Connection to a mainframe|Equal to MAXDATA in the PU definition on the mainframe (recommended).|  
    |Connection to an AS/400|Equal to MAXFRAME on the AS/400 (recommended).|  
    |Connection to a downstream system|Less than or equal to the maximum value supported by the downstream system.|  
  
-   Setting the Max BTU Length correctly is especially important for downstream connections.  
  
-   For SVC connections, check that the codes in **User Data** include C3, which specifies the QLLC protocol (the X.25 protocol used by SNA Manager). To view **User Data** codes, right-click the connection in the left pane, then click **Properties**, then click the **X.25** tab in the **Connection Properties** dialog box. For information about other user data codes, contact your X.25 network administrator.  
  
-   If each attempt at connection activation incurs cost as you access the X.25 network, you may want to limit the number of these attempts. To do this, double-click the connection, and then click the **X.25** tab. In the **Maximum Retries** list, select an appropriate maximum number of attempts. (The default is No Limit.)
