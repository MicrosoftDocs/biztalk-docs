# Planning 3270 Connectivity
In the hierarchical SNA network model most frequently associated with a mainframe computer, you access centralized applications from remote terminals across a network.  
  
 This network model uses the information display protocol for IBM mainframe computers known as 3270. This protocol facilitates conversations between the mainframe and devices such as terminals, printers, and controllers. Through the definition and assignment of 3270 logical units (LUs), [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] provides access to these mainframe resources.  
  
 Once you establish the physical connection from the Host Integration Server computer to the mainframe, you need to determine the type of 3270 connectivity your users need. The topics in this section detail the networking services [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] can provide to your users and offers information on ways to set up these services.
