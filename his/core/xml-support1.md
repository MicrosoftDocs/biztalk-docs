# XML Support
A `DataSet` object can persist and reload its contents as XML and its schema as XSD. The `DataSet` has direct support for reading (shredding) and writing data using XML using the .NET Framework `XmlReader` and `XmlWriter` classes. When you are writing XML, the output conforms to the W3C XSD schema. XML is a good method of moving data between application tiers. The `XMLDataDocument` can use the XML services, such as XSL/T and XPath.
