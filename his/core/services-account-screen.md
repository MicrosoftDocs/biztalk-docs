# Services Account Screen
Setup installs a number of services that must be able to log on to the Windows domain. This requires Setup to create a domain user account and to assign the account the privileges that the services require to operate properly.  
  
 You must provide a domain and user name (domain/user) along with the password for the account. If the account does not exist, Setup will create it.  
  
#### Services Account Configuration screen  
  
1.  Type the domain and user name (domain/user).  
  
2.  Type and confirm the password.  
  
3.  Click **Next**.
