# Viewing Connection Properties
As with other link services, you can view IP-DLC link service properties by using the context menu in the list view of the **Link Services** folder.  
  
### To view connection properties  
  
1.  In the scope pane of the [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../core/includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] MMC snap-in, locate the computer with the link service connections that you want to view.  
  
2.  Expand the list for that computer, expand **SNA Service**, and expand **Connections**. The link service connections for that computer will appear in the right pane.  
  
3.  Right-click the appropriate link service connection, and then click **Properties**. The **Connection Property** page will appear, and the properties for this connection can be viewed or edited.
