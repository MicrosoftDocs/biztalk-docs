# Compiling the Source Text File
After you have created the source text file, the next step is to compile the file using the Pdfcomp (PDFCOMP.EXE) utility located in the \\*platform*\SYSTEM\PRINTSRV directory. To run Pdfcomp, type the following at the command prompt.  
  
```  
input_file output_file  
  
```  
  
 You must specify the full name (including file extensions) of the input and output files.  
  
 For example, to compile the sample PDF file, copy PDFCOMP.EXE and HPLJ2.PDF to a directory on the server's hard disk, open a Command Prompt window and change the current directory to the directory containing the copied files. Then, type the following at the command prompt.  
  
```  
  
hplj2.pdf hplj2.pdt  
  
```  
  
 This creates the binary PDT file in the current directory. Specifying this file in the properties of a printer session allows Host Print service to send preformatted data to the printer, bypassing the formatting function of the Windows printer driver.  
  
 Compilation of the PDF file into a PDT is not strictly necessary. If an uncompiled PDF file is selected in a Print Session under the SNA Manager, the compilation is performed automatically each time the print session is used. This feature has a performance overhead and is available mainly for ease of development. For production systems, it is strongly recommended that you pre-compile PDF files.
