# Deleting Link Services
As with other link services, you can delete an IP-DLC link service in the MMC snap-in.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  When you delete a link service, all related connections will no longer be associated with any link service. A user might associate such a connection with any other IP-DLC link service that is associated with the node. Deleting a node associated with a link service will break association between these items.  
  
### To delete a link service  
  
1. In the scope pane of the [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] MMC snap-in, locate the computer with the link services that you want to delete.  
  
2. Expand the list for that computer.  
  
3. Right-click the appropriate link service, and then click **Delete**.
