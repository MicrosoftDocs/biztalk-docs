# SNA Trace Utility Overview
The [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] SNA Trace Utility (snatrace.exe) is a graphical tool that allows you to enable or disable tracing options and set the SNA Trace Utility parameters.  
  
 After deciding the software components and types of tracing that can provide useful information, start the [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] SNA Trace Utility application and configure trace options for Host Integration Server computers.  
  
 If you are working to improve system performance or solve a difficulty with Host Integration Server components, reviewing trace files can assist in determining the source of the problem.  
  
 The SNA Trace Utility records activity between or within components of Host Integration Server. The files created provide detailed information about the exact sequence of events occurring within Host Integration Server components or between Host Integration Server computers and Host systems on the network.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You must be an administrator on the local account to run the SNA Trace Utility.
