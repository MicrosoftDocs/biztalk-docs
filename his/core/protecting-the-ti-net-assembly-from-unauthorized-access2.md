# Protecting the TI .NET Assembly from Unauthorized Access

## Overview
To prevent an attacker from viewing or modifying the contents of a Transaction Integrator (TI) .NET assembly and then using that information to either create a client application which spoofs the identity of an authorized user or modify the custom properties of the component, you should:  
  
-   Place the computer that is running Visual Studio and TI Designer in a secure location.  
  
-   Confirm that the access permissions to Visual Studio, TI Designer, or any other tool used to modify TI type libraries and .NET assemblies are set correctly.  
  
-   Store all TI .NET assemblies in a secure directory.  
  
-   Confirm that the access permissions are set correctly on all .NET assemblies.  
  
-   Confirm that the access permissions are set correctly on the directory that contains the .NET assemblies.
