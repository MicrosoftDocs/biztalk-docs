# HIS Designer Options
You can select the initial view to display when the Host Integration Server Designer (HIS Designer) starts. You can modify this option through the standard **Options** dialog box in Visual Studio, which is extended to support the functionality of the HIS Designer. You can open this dialog box by clicking **Options** on the **Tools** menu in Visual Studio.
