# Session Identifiers
Host Integration Server maintains a unique identification for every LU 6.2 session it has with a remote LU. This 8-byte identifier is generated by Host Integration Server every time it starts a new session (or is received by Host Integration Server when a session is initiated remotely). The Sync Point resynchronization protocols require knowledge of the session identifier.  
  
 To provide this, the [MC_GET_ATTRIBUTES](./mc-get-attributes2.md) and the [GET_ATTRIBUTES](./get-attributes2.md) verbs have been modified to return the session identifier of the session over which a particular conversation is allocated. The **MC_GET_ATTRIBUTES** and **GET_ATTRIBUTES** verbs can be used to retrieve this **sess_id** field of the VCB if the **opext** field of the VCB is combined with the value AP_EXTD_VCB using OR before calling APPC.
