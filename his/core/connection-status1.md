# Connection Status
The [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] SNA Manager offers six different messages that indicate the status of a connection:  
  
- Active  
  
- Pending  
  
- Stopping  
  
- Inactive  
  
- On Demand: Indicates that the connection is available to be started when needed. On Demand connections can also have all of the statuses listed above.  
  
- Incoming: Indicates that the connection is available to receive incoming calls. Incoming connections can also have all of the statuses listed above.  
  
  To view a connection status, simply select the appropriate connection in the SNA Manager.
