# Virus-Checking Tool Problems
When you are running [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] with some independent software vendor virus checking tools, SNA link services might fail to start due to the following error:  
  
 Event 128: "Can't load IHV DLL xxx.dll"  
  
 where xxx.dll is the specific DLL  
  
 It is recommended that any "real-time scanning" options be disabled on the virus checker before starting Host Integration Server to prevent local file access slowdowns.
