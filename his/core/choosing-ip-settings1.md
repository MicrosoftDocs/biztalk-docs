# Choosing IP Settings
IP settings assigned to the TN5250 definitions allow TN5250 clients to connect to the IBM System i. By default, the TN5250 definition is not assigned an IP address or a subnet mask. This allows any TN5250 client to connect to the IBM System i.  
  
 You can restrict access to the TN5250 service by specifying the IP address or subnet mask of the client workstation(s). When these values are specified, only clients whose IP and/or subnet mask match those specified in the TN5250 configuration are allowed access to the IBM System i through the TN5250 service. You can also specify the workstation name in place of the IP, and use a WINS, DHCP, or other name-resolution service to resolve a friendly name to an IP address.
