# How to Create a Visual Studio Solution
After you create, debug, and confirm your access to the host application, you can start to create the application for the BizTalk Adapter for Host Applications. The first task you must perform is to create a Visual Studio solution. This solution will contain the BizTalk Server and Host Integration Server projects that will, in turn, contain the necessary components for your application.  
  
### To create a Visual Studio solution  
  
1.  In Visual Studio, click **File**, point to **New**, and then click **Project**.  
  
2.  In the **New Project** dialog box, in the Project types pane, click **Other Project Types**, and then click **Visual Studio Solutions**.  
  
3.  In the Templates pane, click **Blank Solution**.  
  
4.  Enter the name of your project in the **Name** field, and then click **OK**.
