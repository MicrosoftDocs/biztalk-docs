# General Tab (Listener Properties)
The **General** tab displays the general properties of the application's local environment. The controls on the **General** tab are read-only.

|**Transport class**|View the class of the transport object.|

>  When viewed from the ***listener*** node, the general properties are read-only. If you want to change a general property, right-click the specific ***local environment* Node** under the **Local Environments Node**, and then left-click **Properties** on the shortcut menu. The properties on that page are read-write.
