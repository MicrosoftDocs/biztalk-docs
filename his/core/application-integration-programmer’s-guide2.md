# Application Integration Programmer’s Guide
This section of the Microsoft Host Integration Server Software Development Kit (SDK) provides information required to develop software to integrate .NET applications with Customer Information Control System (CICS) and Information Management System (IMS) transactions on IBM mainframe z/OS computers and callable RPG programs on midrange i5/OS computers.  
  
 Transaction Integrator (TI) enables developers to integrate mainframe-based transaction programs (TPs) with component-based Microsoft Windows applications. With Transaction Integrator, you can integrate existing mainframe-based TPs with Windows-based .NET applications. You may not have to modify your mainframe TP if the business logic is separate from the presentation logic. The wizards available in the TI Designer and TI Manager guide you through the process, step-by-step.  
  
 Transaction Integrator is appropriate when you need a synchronous or transactional solution where both systems being integrated are running at all times. For applications only requiring an asynchronous integration solution, a messaging-based solution using Message Integrator (WCF Channel for WebSphere MQ) is preferred over Transaction Integrator.  
  
 To use this guide effectively, you should be familiar with the following:  
  
- Host Integration Server  
  
- Microsoft Windows operating systems  
  
- Message Queuing  
  
- IBM CICS or IMS transaction processing systems, or i5/OS servers  
  
- BizTalk Server  
  
  Depending on the application programming interface and development tools used, you should be familiar with the following:  
  
- Microsoft .NET Framework  
  
- ASP.NET  
  
  For API references and other technical information for the Transaction Integrator, see the Programmer's Reference section of the SDK.  
  
  For information about how to tune your system to get the best possible performance from Transaction Integration, see the [Transaction Integrator Performance Guide](./transaction-integrator-performance-guide1.md) in the Operations section.
