# How To Report Errors in Host Integration Server Designer
The standard error-reporting mechanism in Visual Studio is through the **Output** window. This window has been extended to allow for error reporting. For example, if an operation could not be completed, an error message is logged in the **Output** window; the user can then double-click the error message to see its source in the Host Integration Server Designer.
