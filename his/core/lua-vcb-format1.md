# LUA VCB Format
The logical unit application (LUA) verb control block (VCB) is called [LUA_VERB_RECORD](../core/lua-verb-record2.md). It is a structure with two parts:  

- A structure, [LUA_COMMON](../core/lua-common1.md), which is used for all the LUA verbs.  

- A union, [LUA_SPECIFIC](../core/lua-specific1.md), which is used only by [RUI_BID](./rui-bid1.md),[SLI_BID](./sli-bid2.md),[SLI_OPEN](../core/sli-open2.md), and [SLI_SEND](./sli-send2.md).  

  This section contains:  

- [LUA_VERB_RECORD](../core/lua-verb-record2.md)  

- [LUA_COMMON](../core/lua-common1.md)  

- [LUA_SPECIFIC](../core/lua-specific1.md)
