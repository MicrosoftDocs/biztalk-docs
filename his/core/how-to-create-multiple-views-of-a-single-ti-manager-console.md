# How to Create Multiple Views of a Single TI Manager Console
Each instance of a TI (Transaction Integrator) Manager console shows the remote environments configured for a single computer. You cannot load more than one TI Manager console for a single computer. However, you can create multiple views of a single TI Manager console, and then display each view in a separate window. Typically, you can use this feature to display the different details for different selected items in the console tree. To save space on the screen, you can hide the console tree on each window.  
  
 When you add a new window, that window is superimposed on the original window. To make them all visible, cascade or tile the windows. You can then resize or reposition the windows.  
  
### To create multiple views of a TI console  
  
1.  Start TI Manager for the computer.  
  
2.  On the **Action** menu, click **New Window from Here**.  
  
3.  Repeat step 2 for the number of windows that you want to add.  
  
4.  On the **Window** menu, click either **Cascade** or **Tile Horizontally**, depending on how you want to configure the windows.  
  
5.  For each window, select the item in the console tree that you want to display.  
  
### To hide the console tree for a window  
  
-   On the window's **View** menu, click **Customize**.  
  
-   Clear the **Console tree** check box, and select the **Description bar** check box, and then click **OK**.  
  
     The description bar describes the content of the remaining pane, so you no longer need the console tree.
