# SSO with Host-Initiated Processing
When you use Single Sign-On (SSO) security with host-initiated processing (HIP), the impersonation of user credentials is handled differently depending upon whether you are calling a .NET object or a COM object. If HIP is calling a .NET object, there are no special considerations; the Transaction Integrator (TI) run-time environment impersonates the user account. If HIP is calling a COM object, however, there are special considerations.  
  
 Depending on the threading model and registration type of the components, the following actions occur when HIP calls the method of a .COM object when it is impersonating a user account (the one that the host credentials would have been mapped to via SSO):  
  
|Threading Model|Registration|Actions|  
|---------------------|------------------|-------------|  
|Single, apartment|Server/Library/No COM+ application|-   Server object methods are called under HIP Service/COM+ application configured identity.<br />-   Server object methods call **CoImpersonateClient** to start impersonating the user identity.<br />-   Optionally, methods can call **CoRevertToSelf**, although that is not necessary because COM will call it anyway after the method returns.|  
|Free, both, neutral|Server COM+ application|-   Server object methods are called under HIP Service/COM+ application configured identity.<br />-   Server object methods call **CoImpersonateClient** to start impersonating the user identity.<br />-   Optionally, methods can call **CoRevertToSelf**, although that is not necessary because COM will call it anyway after the method returns.|  
|Free, both, neutral|Library/No COM+ application|-   Server object methods are called under the user identity being impersonated.<br />-   Server object method should not call **CoImpersonateClient** or **CoRevertToSelf** because they would fail with RPC_E_CALL_COMPLETE.|  
  
 If you are programming in Microsoft Visual BasicÂ® 6.0, be sure to include the **CoImpersonateClient** and **CoRevertToSelf** declarations in your programs:  
  
```  
Private Declare Function CoImpersonateClient Lib "ole32.dll" () As Long  
Private Declare Function CoRevertToSelf Lib "ole32.dll" () As Long  
```
