# Host Print Services
Host Print service is a Windows Server service, and is found as SnaPrint in the Services utility in Windows Control Panel. To access network printers, the SnaPrint service must run in a domain account that has sufficient privileges to access the network printers. You must create this account before running Host Integration Server setup.
