# Object Node (WIP)
Use the ***object*** node to manage an object.  
  
 Double-click the ***object*** node to expand the node. The right pane displays the following information about the node:  
  
-   **Method**. The name of the methods on the object.  
  
-   **Transaction/Program**.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  If you view the list in the right pane of TI Manager and change the order of the columns using the **Add/Remove Columns** command on the shortcut menu, the order of the column headings might not be correct after you close and re-open TI Manager. The next time you open TI Manager, the values in the columns are displayed in the new order you set, but the column headings are in the their default order.  
  
 If you observe that the column headings are no longer in the order you set:  
  
1.  Right-click the node, point to **View**, and then click **Add/Remove Columns**.  
  
2.  On the **Add/Remove Columns** dialog box, click **Restore Defaults**.  
  
3.  Click a different node, then click the node you were just working on.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  The columns should now be in their original order.  
  
 Right-click the ***object*** node to display the following four options:  
  
-   **Delete**. Deletes the selected object.  
  
-   **Refresh**. Redraws the screen to show any updates  
  
-   **Properties**. Displays the ***object* Properties** dialog box and two tabbed property pages:  
  
    -   **General**  
  
    -   **Hosting**  
  
     Use these property pages to view or change the properties of the *object*.  
  
-   **Help**. Displays a Help topic (this topic) that explains the items that appear in the TI Manager console and the actions you can take.
