# Host Integration Server Support
This section explains how [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] works in Systems Network Architecture (SNA) networks. The following information is included:  
  
- A summary of the types and number of SNA sessions supported by [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)].  
  
- A list of the SNA commands supported by [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)]. This section also shows the type of SNA sessions in which the commands flow.  
  
- The transmission service (TS) and function management (FM) profiles supported by Host Integration Server.  
  
- A list and explanation of the five categories of SNA sense codes generated by [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)]. This section also describes logical unit (LU) type 6.2-specific sense data.  
  
  For specific information about an application programming interface (API) supported by [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)], see the programmer's guide for that API:
