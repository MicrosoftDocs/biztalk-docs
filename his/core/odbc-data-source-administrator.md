# ODBC Data Source Administrator
The Microsoft ODBC Data Source Administrator manages database drivers and data sources. This application is located in the Windows Control Panel under Administrative Tools. Beginning in Windows 8, the icon is named ODBC Data Sources, and on 64-bit operating systems there is a 32-bit and 64-bit version. Using the ODBC Data Source Administrator, you can add/modify/remove connections for use with the Microsoft ODBC Driver for DB2.  
  
 Data sources are the databases or files accessed by a driver and are identified by a data source name (DSN). Use the ODBC Data Source Administrator to add, configure, and delete data sources from your system. The types of data sources that can be used are described in the following table.  
  
|Data source|Description|  
|-----------------|-----------------|  
|User|User DSNs are local to a computer and can be used only by the current user. They are registered in the HKEY_CURRENT_USER registry.|  
|System|System DSNs are local to a computer rather than dedicated to a user. The system or any user with privileges can use a data source set up with a system DSN. System DSNs are registered in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE registry.|  
|File|File DSNs are file-based sources that can be shared among all users who have the same drivers installed and therefore have access to the database. These data sources need not be dedicated to a user nor be local to a computer. File data source names are not identified by dedicated registry entries; instead, they are identified by a file name with a .dsn extension. File data sources are stored in C:\Program Files\Common Files\ODBC\Data Sources.|  
  
 User and system data sources are collectively known as machine data sources because they are local to a computer. Each of these data sources has a tab in the **ODBC Data Source Administrator** dialog box.  
  
 To open the ODBC Data Source Administrator in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.  
  
1.  On the **Start** menu, click **Control Panel**.  
  
2.  In Control Panel, click Administrative Tools.  
  
3.  In Administrative Tools, click Data Sources (ODBC).  
  
 To open the ODBC Data Source Administrator in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012.  
  
1.  On the **Start** menu, click **Control Panel**.  
  
2.  In Control Panel, click Administrative Tools.  
  
3.  In Administrative Tools, click ODBC Data Sources.  
  
 Using the ODBC Data Source Administrator, you can add, modify, and delete data sources, as described in the following table.  
  
|Action|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|Adding data sources|It is possible to add multiple data sources, each one associating a driver with some data you want to access by using that driver. Give each data source a name that uniquely identifies that data source. For example, if you create a data source for a set of DB2 tables that contain customer information, you might name the data source "Customers." Applications typically display data source names for users to choose from. Adding a file data source is slightly different from adding user or system data sources.|  
|Modifying data sources|Depending on your requirements, you might find it necessary to reconfigure data sources. You can reset options by clicking Configure in any driver setup dialog box.|  
|Deleting data sources|Click Remove after selecting a data source.|  
  
 To add a data source for the ODBC Driver for DB2 using the ODBC Data Source Administrator.  
  
1.  In the **ODBC Data Source Administrator** dialog, click **Add**.  
  
2.  In the **Create New Data Source** dialog, click **Microsoft ODBC Driver for DB2**, and then click **Finish**.  
  
 The Microsoft ODBC Driver for DB2 Configuration dialog contains five tabs.
