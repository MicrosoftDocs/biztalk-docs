# How to Modify and Update a Transaction Integrator Interface
Once you have imported a host definition file, you can modify and update the interface. Optionally, if you did not start with a host definition file, you can create a new TI interface using the available tools.  
  
 Once you have modified the interface, you can deploy and write code against the interface.  
  
### To create, modify, or update a TI interface  
  
1.  Use HIS Designer to create, modify, or update the TI interface. For more information, see [Host Integration Server Designer UI](./host-integration-server-designer-ui1.md).
