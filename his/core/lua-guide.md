# LUA Guide
This section provides information required to develop C-language applications that use the conventional logical unit application (LUA) programming interface to exchange data in a Systems Network Architecture (SNA) environment.  
  
 This implementation of LUA is compatible with the Request Unit Interface (RUI) and the Session Level Interface (SLI) of earlier versions of the LUA for Windows operating systems and the IBM Extended Services for OS/2 version 1.0.  
  
 This section provides conceptual information and detailed reference information.  
  
 To use this section effectively, you should be familiar with:  
  
-   SNA concepts  
  
-   General concepts for the communications software you have installed. (Refer to your product documentation for information.)
