# Configure a New Security Policy Wizard Page (in the New Application Deployment Wizard) (1)
Use the first **Confige a New Security Policy** wizard page to identify the security policy and the source of the credentials. Type the name of the security policy, and then select the source for the credentials.  
  
|Use this|To do this|  
|--------------|----------------|  
|**Security policy**|Type the name for the security policy. The name can be a maximum of 259 Unicode characters (alphabetic, numeric, space, and special). The name cannot be the same as the name of an existing security policy.

|**Host-initiated Single Sign-on**|Select this option to use host user ID and password. This option is automatically disabled if Single Sign-on (SSO) is not installed or not available.|  
|**Windows credentials of the HIP application**|Select this option to use Windows user ID and password specified on the HIP NT application service. This option is automatically selected if SSO is not installed or not available.|
