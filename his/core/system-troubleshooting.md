# System Troubleshooting
When gathering information about system difficulties, it is best to start with information provided by the Windows Event Log and System Monitor, see [Windows Utilities](../core/windows-utilities.md) for additional information.  
  
 Event log information is generally more straightforward to interpret than trace information; use trace information only if event logs do not provide enough details.  
  
 When you report system problems to Microsoft Customer Service and Support, a technician may ask you for trace files and other system information:  
  
-   Trace files  
  
-   Windows Event Logs  
  
-   The current configuration file (Com.cfg)  
  
-   Dump files, which may be created by [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../core/includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] when a system trap (exception error) occurs  
  
-   Datascope traces of protocol exchanges
