# Precedence of Accounts in Determining LU Access
When user and group account memberships overlap, the highest-priority account that contains a 3270 LU or pool determines the access the user gets. Accounts are prioritized as follows:  
  
1. User accounts (highest priority)  
  
2. Subdomain groups  
  
3. Local groups  
  
4. Well-known groups such as Everyone (lowest priority)  
  
   For example, if a 3270 LU called LU 1 is assigned to a user account (a high-priority account) called JOHND, and at the same time an LU called LU 2 is assigned to a local group (a low-priority account) of which JOHND is a member, JOHND will be given access to LU 1, not LU 2.
