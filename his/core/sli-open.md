# SLI_OPEN
The **SLI_OPEN** verb transfers control of the specified logical unit (LU) to the Microsoft® Windows® logical unit application (LUA) application. **SLI_OPEN** establishes a session between the system services control point (SSCP) and the specified LU, as well as an LU-LU session.  
  
 The following structure describes the LUA_COMMON member of the verb control block (VCB) used by SLI_OPEN.  
  
 The second syntax union describes the **LUA_SPECIFIC** member of the VCB used by **SLI_OPEN**. Other union members are omitted for clarity.

struct LUA_EXT_ENTRY {  
    unsigned char lua_routine_type;  
    unsigned char lua_module_name[9];  
    unsigned char lua_procedure_name[33];  
} ;

    unsigned char         lua_init_type;  
    unsigned char         lua_resv65;  
    unsigned short        lua_wait;  
    struct LUA_EXT_ENTRY  lua_open_extension[3];  
    unsigned char         lua_ending_delim;

 SLI_OPEN requires this parameter.

 **lua_extension_list_offset**  
 Supplied parameter. Specifies the offset from the start of the VCB to the extension list of user-supplied dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). The value must be the beginning of a word boundary unless there is no extension list. In this case, the value must be set to zero.  
  
 If this option is not used by SLI_OPEN, this member should be set to zero.

-   For all other open types, this field should be set to zero.  
  
 This information is provided by the Windows LUA application.

 Supplied parameter. Indicates whether incomplete reads are supported. If this parameter is set to 1, incomplete or truncated reads are supported. For more details, see the remarks for [RUI_READ](../core/rui-read.md).  
  
 **lua_encr_decr_option**  
 Not used by **SLI_OPEN** and should be set to zero.

 The code will be posted to **SLI_OPEN** when an NAU is at its limit, unless you use the RETRY option.  
  
 To use the reset option, set **lua_wait** to a value other than zero. The LOGON or INITSELF command will be retried until the host is ready or until you issue **SLI_CLOSE**.  
  
 LUA_LU_COMPONENT_DISCONNECTED  
  
 Secondary return code; an LU component is unavailable because it is not connected properly. Make sure that the power is on.  
  
 LUA_NEGOTIABLE_BIND_ERROR

 Secondary return code; the required SSCP-LU is inactive. Specific sense code information is in bytes 2 and 3. Valid settings are 0x0000, 0x0001, 0x0002, 0x0003, and 0x0004.  
  
 LUA_SESSION_SERVICES_PATH_ERROR  
  
 Secondary return code; a request for session services cannot be rerouted to an SSCP-SSCP session path. Specific sense code information in bytes 2 and 3 gives more information about why the request cannot be rerouted.

 LUA_ENCR_DECR_PROC_ERROR  
  
 Secondary return code; an unexpected return code was received from the OS/2 **DosGetProcAddr** function while attempting to get the procedure address within the user-provided encryption or decryption dynamic link module.  
  
 LUA_NEG_NOTIFY_RSP  
  
 Secondary return code; the SSCP responded negatively to a NOTIFY request issued indicating that the secondary LU was capable of a session. The half-session component that received the request understood and supported the request but could not execute it.  
  
 LUA_LU_INOPERATIVE  
  
 Secondary return code; a severe error occurred while the SLI was attempting to stop the session. This LU is unavailable for any LUA requests until an activate logical unit (ACTLU) is received from the host.  
  
 LUA_CANCELED  
 Primary return code; the secondary return code gives the reason for canceling the command.  
  
 LUA_TERMINATED  
  
 Secondary return code; the session was terminated when a verb was pending. The verb process was canceled.  
  
 LUA_IN_PROGRESS  
 Primary return code; an asynchronous command was received but is not completed.  
  
 LUA_COMM_SUBSYSTEM_ABENDED  
 Primary return code; indicates one of the following conditions:  
  
-   The node used by this conversation encountered an ABEND.  
  
-   The connection between the transaction program (TP) and the physical unit (PU) 2.1 node has been broken (a LAN error).  
  
-   The SnaBase at the TPs computer encountered an ABEND.  
  
 LUA_COMM_SUBSYSTEM_NOT_LOADED  
 Primary return code; a required component could not be loaded or terminated while processing the verb. Thus, communication could not take place. Contact the system administrator for corrective action.  
  
 LUA_INVALID_VERB_SEGMENT  
 Primary return code; the VCB extended beyond the end of the data segment.  
  
 LUA_UNEXPECTED_DOS_ERROR  
 Primary return code; after issuing an operating system call, an unexpected operating system return code was received and is specified in the secondary return code.  
  
 LUA_STACK_TOO_SMALL  
 Primary return code; the stack size of the application is too small to execute the verb. Increase the stack size of your application.  
  
 LUA_INVALID_VERB  
 Primary return code; either the verb code or the operation code, or both, is invalid. The verb did not execute.  
  
## Remarks  
 For each **SLI_OPEN**, the Windows LUA interface:  
  
-   Starts the communication session.  
  
-   Reads and verifies a BIND command from the host, and passes it to the application if a BIND extension routine is supplied.  
  
-   Writes a BIND response.  
  
-   Reads and processes the STSN command and passes it to the application if a BIND extension is supplied (if necessary).  
  
-   Writes the STSN response (if necessary).  
  
-   Reads the CRV command (if necessary).  
  
-   Writes the CRV response (if necessary).  
  
-   Reads and processes the SDT command.  
  
-   Writes the SDT response.  
  
 The Windows LUA interface does the following additional functions for sessions that issue **SLI_OPEN** with the open type set to LUA_INIT_TYPE_SEC_IS or LUA_INIT_TYPE_SEC_LOG:  
  
-   Writes an INITSELF or an unformatted LOGON message.  
  
-   Reads and processes an INITSELF response or LOGON message response.  
  
 All SNA message traffic is administered by **SLI_OPEN** through the SDT command response.  
  
 To choose a certain LU configured for Windows LUA, the application sets lua_luname to the LU name in ASCII, padded with trailing spaces if necessary.  
  
 When SLI_OPEN is posted with LUA_OK in the lua_prim_rc parameter, SLI_OPEN successfully completed and the LU-LU data-flow session was established. The application can now issue [SLI_BID](../core/sli-bid.md), [SLI_CLOSE](../core/sli-close.md), [SLI_PURGE](../core/sli-purge.md), [SLI_RECEIVE](../core/sli-receive.md), and [SLI_SEND](../core/sli-send.md).  
  
 When SLI_OPEN is posted with a primary return code other than LUA_OK or LUA_IN_PROGRESS, the command did not successfully establish a session.  
  
 When using SLI_OPEN, a Windows LUA application must provide a session initialization type. Valid types are:  
  
-   [Secondary with INITSELF](../core/secondary-with-initself.md)  
  
-   [Secondary with an Unformatted LOGON Message](../core/secondary-with-an-unformatted-logon-message.md)  
  
-   [Primary Waiting for a BIND Command](../core/primary-waiting-for-a-bind-command.md)  
  
-   [Primary with SSCP Access](../core/primary-with-sscp-access.md)  
  
-   [Secondary with INITSELF](../core/secondary-with-initself.md)

-   [Primary Waiting for a BIND Command](../core/primary-waiting-for-a-bind-command.md)  
  
-   [Primary with SSCP Access](../core/primary-with-sscp-access.md)  
  
-   [BIND, CRV, and STSN Routines](../core/bind-crv-and-stsn-routines.md)  
  
-   [BIND Example](../core/bind-example.md)  
  
-   [Recovering from SESSION_FAILURE](../core/recovering-from-session-failure.md)  
  
-   [Ending a Pending SLI_OPEN](../core/ending-a-pending-sli-open.md)
