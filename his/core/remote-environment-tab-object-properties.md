# Remote Environment Tab (Object Properties)
Use the **Remote Environment** tab to set the remote environment properties of the object.

|**Remote environment**|View the name of the remote environment to which this object is assigned. This list is populated by the remote environments already defined and that agree in network type, host environment and programming model. You can select a different remote environment for this object.|
