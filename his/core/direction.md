# Direction
When an function management interface (FMI) application is communicating on its primary logical unit (PLU) connection with a normal flow request mode other than full-duplex (that is, half-duplex flip-flop or half-duplex contention), it must obey the SNA direction protocol. These two modes are treated separately.
