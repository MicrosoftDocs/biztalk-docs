# Transaction Integrator Basic Functions
In current Internet-driven, graphical user interface (GUI) computing environments, users usually prefer to access mainframe online transaction processing (OLTP) applications using the same interfaces that they use to access the Internet or their organizations intranet, instead of by using traditional green screen, dumb terminal access methods. Transaction Integrator (TI) provides any application that is compatible with Windows Server access to transactions and data in CICS, IMS, OS/400 applications. By providing this access, TI reduces the time and effort involved in programming specialized interfaces for mainframe computers.  
  
 As a generic proxy for a mainframe or midrange computer, TI intercepts object method calls and redirects those calls to the appropriate host application. TI also handles the return of all output parameters and values from the host computer. When TI intercepts the method call, it converts and formats the parameters from the representation understood by the Microsoft Windows platform into the representation that is understandable by the host transaction program (TP).
