# System Troubleshooting
When gathering information about system difficulties, it is best to start with information provided by the Windows Event Log and System Monitor, see [Windows Utilities](../core/windows-utilities2.md) for additional information.  
  
 Event log information is generally more straightforward to interpret than trace information; use trace information only if event logs do not provide enough details.  
  
 When you report system problems to Microsoft Customer Service and Support, a technician may ask you for trace files and other system information:  
  
- Trace files  
  
- Windows Event Logs  
  
- The current configuration file (Com.cfg)  
  
- Dump files, which may be created by [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] when a system trap (exception error) occurs  
  
- Datascope traces of protocol exchanges
