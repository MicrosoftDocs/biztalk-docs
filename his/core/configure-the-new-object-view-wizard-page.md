|**Object methods**|View all the methods that are defined in the object. Each row in the list contains a summary of the resolution information for a single method. Rows cannot be deleted. The columns are:<br /><br /> <ul><li>**Include:** Select this option to include the method in the object view.</li><li>**Method:** Displays the name of the method. Double-click the method name to display the **Method Resolution Criteria** dialog box.</li><li>**Endpoint manager:** For a TCP/IP network, select or type the IP address or host name to manage the endpoint. For an SNA network, type the name of the LU alias. In either case, the name can be a maximum of 259 alpha-numeric characters.</li><li>**Endpoint:** Displays one of the endpoints defined in the local environment associated with the view. To change the content of this field, double-click the **Endpoint** field for a specific method.</li><li>**Resolution Type:** Displays one of the possible resolution types:<br /><br /> <ul><li>**Endpoint**<br /><br />         If the local environment has all of its endpoints in use by object views, associated with the same host environment, that specify **Endpoint Resolution**, you will receive an error message.<br /><br />         If the local environment has all of its endpoints in use by object views, associated with the same host environment, that specify **TRM** or **Data** resolution, no endpoint is available for **Endpoint** resolution and **TRM** or **Data** resolution must be supplied for the other methods.<br /><br />         If the local environment has one or more endpoints available for endpoint resolution, the first method of the view appears. The first method has its endpoint set to the first endpoint in the local environment that is available for endpoint resolution and the resolution type is set to **Endpoint**. All the remaining methods have the **Endpoint**, **Resolution Type**, **Resolution Data**, and **Resolution Position** boxes cleared.</li><li>**Transaction Request Message (TRM)**<br /><br />         If the local environment currently has all of its endpoints in use by object views, associated with the same host environment, that specify **Endpoint** or **Data** resolution, the list control is not available.<br /><br />         If an endpoint is available for TRM resolution, **Include** is selected for all methods and their endpoint is set to the first endpoint associated with the endpoint that is available for TRM resolution.<br /><br />         All methods have resolution type set to **Transaction Request Message (TRM)**; the **Resolution Data** and **Resolution Position** boxes are cleared.</li><li>**Enhanced Listener Message (ELM)**</li><li>**Data**<br /><br />         If the local environment currently has all of its endpoints in use by object views, associated with the same host environment that specified **Endpoint** or **TRM** resolution, the list control is not available.<br /><br />         If an endpoint is available for data resolution, **Include** is selected for all methods and their endpoint is set to the first endpoint associated with the endpoint that is available for data resolution.<br /><br />         All methods have resolution type set to **Data,** and the **Resolution Data** and **Resolution Position** boxes are cleared.</li><li>**Link to Program**</li></ul></li></ul><br /> To change the content of this field, double-click the **Resolution Type** field for a specific method.<br /><br /> -   **Resolution Data** Identifies the data used to select the method to be executed. To change the content of this field, double-click the **Resolution Data** field for a specific method.<br />-   **Resolution Position** View the resolution position. If **Data Resolution** is selected, this information is used by the TI runtime to identify the starting point in the data stream in which to look for the data defined in the resolution data field to determine what method is to be executed. To change the content of this field, double-click the **Resolution Position** field for a specific method.|
