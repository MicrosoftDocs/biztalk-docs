# Code Page Translation
The choice of language or code page in TI Manager for a remote environment (RE) determines which code page is used to convert from Unicode on the automation side to Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC) on the mainframe side. You can either select the language and accept the subsequent default code page for that language, or you can select the specific code page itself.
