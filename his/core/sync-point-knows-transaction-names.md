# Sync Point Knows Transaction Names
A Sync Point implementation that knows the names of all the transactions that can be supported (for example, through configuration of the gateway) may accept incoming Sync Point conversations by issuing a [RECEIVE_ALLOCATE](../Topic/RECEIVE_ALLOCATE2.md) verb specifying the name of the transaction and indicating that it is willing to accept Sync Point conversations.  
  
 The **RECEIVE_ALLOCATE** verb was modified to allow a TP to specify that it can accept Sync Point conversations by adding a new **syncpoint_rqd** field to the VCB. When this field is set to AP_YES it indicates that the transaction program can accept Sync Point conversations from Host Integration Server. When this field is set to AP_NO (the default), it indicates that Sync Point conversations are not supported.
