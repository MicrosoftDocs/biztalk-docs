# Defining an SNA Remote Environment
You can define an SNA (APPC/LU 6.2) remote environment (RE) instance to fit each of the following three mainframe-based programming models:  
  
- CICS Link Using LU 6.2  
  
- CICS Using LU 6.2  
  
- IMS Using LU 6.2  
  
  Use TI Manager to define instances for any of these RE types.
