# Non-APPC LU Status
The status of a non-Advanced Program-to-Program Communications (APPC) logical unit (LU) can be:  
  
- Inactive  
  
- In Session  
  
- System Services Control Point (SSCP). This indicates that the LU is in use, but is not yet bound to a specific host application.  
  
- Available: Indicates the LU is recognized by the host as an available LU.  
  
- Pending: Indicates that a user is trying to access the LU, but either the connection is inactive or the mainframe does not recognize the LU.  
  
- Unavailable: Applies to downstream LUs only.  
  
  To view the status of an LU, select the LU in the SNA Manager.
