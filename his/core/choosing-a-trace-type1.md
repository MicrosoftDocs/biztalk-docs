# Choosing a Trace Type
After selecting one or more [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] components to be traced, decide the type of tracing to apply.  

 The following table describes the types of tracing available:  


| Type of tracing |                                                                                          Activity traced                                                                                          |                       Applies to installed components                       |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   Internal\*    |                                      Activity within a software component of [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)].                                      | SnaBase, SnaServer (PU 2.1 node), SNA applications, link services and more. |
|     Message     | Messages passed into and out of a software component of [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)], including messages sent to and received from the network. | SnaBase, SnaServer (PU 2.1 node), SNA applications, link services and more. |
|       API       |    Information passed into and out of a [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] DLL, as the DLL communicates with an application, such as the APPC DLL.    |                         SNA applications and more.                          |

 \* Internal tracing is intended for use by product support technicians. Interpreting internal traces and certain types of message traces requires a specialized knowledge base.
