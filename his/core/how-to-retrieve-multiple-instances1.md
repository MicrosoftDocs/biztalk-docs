# How to Retrieve Multiple Instances
You can retrieve a local copy of the collection with a call to **ExecQuery**. After you have retrieved an instance, you can modify and update the instance. The following example shows how to retrieve a collection:  
  
```  
Set colItems = objWMIService.ExecQuery("Select * from MSSnaStatus_Connection")  
  
```
