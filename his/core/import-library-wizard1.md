# Import Library Wizard
The **Import Library Wizard** enables you to import an existing library, whether it is annotated or not, to the existing component. The methods, recordsets, user-defined types, and unions from the imported library are inserted under the library in the Host Integration Server (HIS) designer.  
  
 You can start this wizard by selecting **Import Library** on the **Library** top-level menu. This wizard does not have welcome and finish page because it only selects a file to import. It is a single page dialog box, which is the standard Open File dialog box.
