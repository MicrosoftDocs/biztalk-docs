# Creating the Source Text File
You can use any text editor (such as Notepad) to create the source text file. The conventional file name extension for the source text file is .pdf (which stands for Printer Definition File).  
  
 The PDF file consists of two sections:  
  
- The [Macro Definition Section](../core/macro-definition-section1.md)  
  
- The [Parameter Definition Section](../core/parameter-definition-section2.md)  
  
  All text bounded by the C-language comment markers (**/\\*** and **\*/**) is treated as comments and ignored by the compiler.
