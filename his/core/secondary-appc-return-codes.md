# Secondary APPC Return Codes
## 00000000  
 AP_CNOS_ACCEPTED  
 APPC accepts the session lines and responsibility as specified.  
  
## 00000001  
 AP_BAD_TP_ID  
 The value of **tp_id** did not match a transaction program (TP) identifier assigned by APPC.  
  
## 00000002  
 AP_BAD_CONV_ID  
 The value of **conv_id** did not match a conversation identifier assigned by APPC.  
  
## 00000003  
 AP_BAD_LU_ALIAS  
 APPC cannot find the specified **lu_alias** among those defined.  
  
## 000000C4  
 AP_RCV_IMMD_BAD_FILL (for a basic conversation)  
 The **fill** parameter was set to an invalid value.  
  
## 00000004  
 AP_ALLOCATION_FAILURE_NO_RETRY  
 The conversation cannot be allocated because of a permanent condition, such as a configuration error or session protocol error. To determine the error, the system administrator should examine the error log file. Do not retry the allocation until the error has been corrected.  
  
## 00000005  
 AP_ALLOCATION_FAILURE_RETRY  
 The conversation could not be allocated because of a temporary condition, such as a link failure. The reason for the failure is logged in the system error log. Retry the allocation.  
  
## 00000006  
 AP_INVALID_DATA_SEGMENT  
 The program initiation parameters (PIP) data was longer than the allocated data segment, or the address of the PIP data buffer was wrong.  
  
## 00000007  
 AP_CNOS_NEGOTIATED  
 APPC accepts the session limits and responsibility as negotiable by the partner logical unit (LU). Values that can be negotiated are:  
  
 **plu_mode_session_limit**  
  
 **min_conwinners_source**  
  
 **min_conwinners_target**  
  
 **responsible**  
  
 **drain_target**

## 00000011  
 AP_BAD_CONV_TYPE (for a basic conversation)  
 The value specified for **conv_type** was invalid.  
  
## 00000012  
 AP_BAD_SYNC_LEVEL  
 The value specified for **sync_level** was invalid.  
  
## 00000013

 SNASVCMG is not a valid value for **mode_name**.

 The value specified for **mode_name** was invalid.  
  
## 00000031  
 AP_CONFIRM_ON_SYNC_LEVEL_NONE  
 The local TP attempted to use [CONFIRM](../core/confirm.md) or [MC_CONFIRM](../core/mc-confirm.md) in a conversation with a synchronization level of AP_NONE. The synchronization level, established by [ALLOCATE](../core/allocate.md) or [MC_ALLOCATE](../core/mc-allocate.md), must be AP_CONFIRM_SYNC_LEVEL.  
  
## 00000032  
 AP_CONFIRM_BAD_STATE  
 The conversation was not in SEND state.  
  
## 00000033

 The conversation for the local TP was in SEND state, and the local TP did not finish sending a logical record.  
  
## 00000051  
 AP_DEALLOC_BAD_TYPE  
 The **dealloc_type** parameter was not set to a valid value.  
  
## 00000052  
 AP_DEALLOC_FLUSH_BAD_STATE  
 The conversation was not in SEND state and the TP attempted to flush the send buffer. This attempt occurred because the value of **dealloc_type** was AP_FLUSH or because the value of **dealloc_type** was AP_SYNC_LEVEL and the synchronization level of the conversation was AP_NONE. In either case, the conversation must be in SEND state.  
  
## 00000053

 The conversation was not in SEND state, and the TP attempted to flush the send buffer and send a confirmation request.  
  
## 00000055  
 AP_DEALLOC_NOT_LL_BDY (for a basic conversation)  
 The conversation was in SEND state, and the TP did not finish sending a logical record. The **dealloc_type** parameter was set to AP_SYNC_LEVEL or AP_FLUSH.

 The conversation was not in RECEIVE or SEND state when the TP issued this verb.  
  
## 000000B2  
 AP_RCV_AND_WAIT_NOT_LL_BDY (for a basic conversation)  
 The conversation was in SEND state; the TP began but did not finish sending a logical record.  
  
## 000000B5

 The **fill** parameter was set to an invalid value.  
  
## 000000C1

## 000000F1  
 AP_BAD_LL (for a basic conversation)  
 The logical record length field of a logical record contained an invalid value â€” 0x0000, 0x0001, 0x8000, or 0x8001. See [About Transaction Programs](../Topic/Transaction%20Programs%20Overview2.md) for information on logical records.

 AP_SEND_DATA_NOT_SEND_STATE

## 000000F5  
 AP_SEND_DATA_CONFIRM_ON_SYNC_NONE  
 The type CONFIRM is not permitted for a conversation that was allocated with a **sync_level** of NONE.  
  
## 000000F6  
 AP_SEND_DATA_NOT_LL_BDY (for a basic conversation)

 AP_SEND_DATA_DEALLOC_FLUSH  
  
 AP_SEND_DATA_DEALLOC_SYNC_LEVEL  
  
 AP_SEND_DATA_P_TO_R_FLUSH

## 00000155  
 AP_MIN_GT_TOTAL  
 The sum of **min_conwinners_source** and **min_conwinners_target** specifies a number greater than **partner_lu_mode_session_limit**.  
  
## 00000156

 The partner LU does not recognize the specified mode name.  
  
## 00000159  
 AP_RESET_SNA_DRAINS  
 The SNASVCMG mode does not support the **drain** parameter values.  
  
## 0000015A

## 0000015F  
 AP_CNOS_COMMAND_RACE_REJECT

 AP_ALLOCATE_NOT_PENDING  
 APPC did not find an incoming allocate (from the invoking TP) to match the value of **tp_name**, supplied by [RECEIVE_ALLOCATE](../core/receive-allocate.md). **RECEIVE_ALLOCATE** waited for the incoming allocate and eventually timed out.  
  
## 00000519
