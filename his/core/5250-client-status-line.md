# 5250 Client Status Line
The following list describes the information displayed in the status line of the 5250 Client.  
  
 **Connection Indicator** The session is in the indicated state: connected or disconnected. When menu items are highlighted, an explanation of the menu item is displayed.  
  
 **Status Indicators** These indicators are only true when red.  
  
 **SA (System Available)** The AS/400 is operating and is available to the computer.  
  
 **MW (Message Waiting)** The AS/400 has one or more messages for you.  
  
 **KS (Keyboard Shift)** The keyboard is in shifted mode.  
  
 **IM (Insert Mode)** Characters inserted into an existing field will not type over the existing data.  
  
 **II (Input Inhibited)** Keyboard input is not being accepted by the AS/400. Try pressing the ERROR RESET key. If it is still highlighted, the system is processing your request.  
  
 **KB (Keystroke Buffering)** Keystrokes are being saved in a temporary buffer (storage space), because keyboard input is not being accepted by the AS/400 (as indicated by the II indicator). After the II indicator goes off, the keystrokes will be processed. To clear the keystroke buffering, press the ERROR RESET key.  
  
 **System and Device Indicators** These indicators appear only when the Client is connected to the AS/400.
