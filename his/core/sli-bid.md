# SLI_BID
The **SLI_BID** verb notifies the Session Level Interface (SLI) application that a message is waiting to be read using [SLI_RECEIVE](../core/sli-receive.md). **SLI_BID** also provides the current status of the session to the Windows logical unit application (LUA) application.  
  
 The following structure describes the LUA_COMMON member of the verb control block (VCB) used by SLI_BID.  
  
 The second syntax union describes the **LUA_SPECIFIC** member of the VCB used by **SLI_BID**. Other union members are omitted for clarity.  
  
## Syntax

 LUA_NOT_READY  
  
 Secondary return code; an SNA UNBIND type 0x02 command was received, which means a new BIND is coming.  
  
 If the UNBIND type 0x02 is received after the beginning [SLI_OPEN](../core/sli-open.md) is complete, the session is suspended until a BIND, optional CRV and STSN, and SDT flows are received. These routines are re-entrant because they have to be called again. The session resumes after the SLI processes the SDT command.  
  
 If the UNBIND type 0x02 is received while SLI_OPEN is still processing, the primary return code is session-failure, not status. Or, the receipt of an SNA CLEAR caused the suspension. Receipt of an SNA SDT will cause the session to resume.  
  
 LUA_INIT_COMPLETE  
  
 Secondary return code; the LUA interface initialized the session while **SLI_OPEN** was processing. LUA applications that issue **SLI_OPEN** with the **lua_open_type_prim_sscp** parameter receive this status on [SLI_RECEIVE](../core/sli-receive.md) or **SLI_BID**.  
  
 LUA_SESSION_END_REQUESTED  
  
 Secondary return code; the LUA interface received an SNA shutdown command (SHUTD) from the host, which means the host is ready to shut down the session.  
  
 LUA_COMM_SUBSYSTEM_ABENDED  
 Primary return code; indicates one of the following conditions:  
  
 The node used by this conversation encountered an ABEND.  
  
 The connection between the transaction program (TP) and the physical unit (PU) 2.1 node has been broken (a LAN error).  
  
 The SnaBase at the TPs computer encountered an ABEND.  
  
 LUA_COMM_SUBSYSTEM_NOT_LOADED  
 Primary return code; a required component could not be loaded or terminated while processing the verb. Thus, communication could not take place. Contact the system administrator for corrective action.  
  
 LUA_INVALID_VERB_SEGMENT  
 Primary return code; the VCB extended beyond the end of the data segment.  
  
 LUA_UNEXPECTED_DOS_ERROR  
 Primary return code; after issuing an operating system call, an unexpected operating system return code was received and is specified in the secondary return code.  
  
 LUA_STACK_TOO_SMALL  
 Primary return code; the stack size of the application is too small to execute the verb. Increase the stack size of your application.  
  
 LUA_INVALID_VERB  
 Primary return code; either the verb code or the operation code, or both, is invalid. The verb did not execute.  
  
## Remarks  
 **SLI_BID** does the following:  
  
-   Notifies a Windows LUA application that a message is waiting to be read.  
  
-   Provides the current session status.  
  
-   Provides a preview of the next message that will be read by [SLI_RECEIVE](../core/sli-receive.md).  
  
     This preview contains a maximum of 12 bytes of information (peek data) that enables the Windows LUA application to define its processing strategy for the data.  
  
 To use **SLI_BID** within a Windows LUA application, issue **SLI_BID**. When the verb completes, it can be reactivated in the following two ways:  
  
-   Reissue **SLI_BID**.  
  
-   Issue SLI_RECEIVE with lua_flag1_bid_enable set to 1. This issues an SLI_BID that uses the most recently accepted address for the VCB and establishes the active bid.  
  
 Each session can have only one **SLI_BID** at a time.  
  
 If multiple messages are available when a Windows LUA application issues SLI_BID, the data flow with the highest priority is returned. The order in which the data can be returned is as follows:  
  
-   SSCP expedited  
  
-   LU expedited  
  
-   SSCP normal  
  
-   LU normal  
  
 If [SLI_RECEIVE](../core/sli-receive.md) has flags set to read more than one type of message flow, the data returned by **SLI_BID** might be for a flow different than the one for which you actually receive data through **SLI_RECEIVE**. This situation occurs when higher priority data arrives from the host after **SLI_BID** completes processing, but before **SLI_RECEIVE** is issued.  
  
 To ensure that SLI_RECEIVE reads the data, the SLI_BID returned specifies the flow that matches lua_flag2 returned by the completed SLI_BID.  
  
## Session Status Return Values  
 If LUA_STATUS is the primary return code, the secondary return code can be LUA_READY, LUA_NOT_READY, LUA_SESSION_END_REQUESTED, or LUA_INIT_COMPLETE. In addition, if LUA_STATUS is the primary return code, the following parameters are used:  
  
 lua_sec_rc  
  
 lua_sid  
  
 LUA_READY is returned after LUA_NOT_READY status, and indicates that the SLI is again ready to perform all commands.  
  
 LUA_NOT_READY indicates that the SLI session is suspended because the SLI has received either an SNA CLEAR command or an SNA UNBIND command with an 0x02 UNBIND type (UNBIND with BIND forthcoming). Depending on what caused the suspension, the session can be reactivated as follows:  
  
-   When the suspension is caused by an SNA CLEAR, receiving an SNA SDT reactivates the session.  
  
-   When an SNA UNBIND type BIND forthcoming causes suspension of the session and the [SLI_OPEN](../core/sli-open.md) that opened the session is completed, the session is suspended until the SLI receives a BIND and SDT command. The session can also optionally receive an STSN command. As a result, user-supplied routines issued with the initial SLI_OPEN must be re-entered because they will be recalled.  
  
 The application can send SSCP data after a CLEAR or UNBIND type BIND forthcoming arrives and before the NOT READY status is read. The application can send and receive SSCP data after reading a NOT READY.  
  
 When an SNA UNBIND type BIND forthcoming arrives before completion of the SLI_OPEN that opened the session, LUA_SESSION_FAILURE (not LUA_STATUS) is the primary return code.  
  
 LUA_SESSION_END_REQUESTED indicates that the application received an SNA SHUTD from the host. The Windows LUA application should issue [SLI_CLOSE](../core/sli-close.md) to close the session when convenient.  
  
 LUA_INIT_COMPLETE is returned only when lua_init_type for SLI_OPEN is LUA_INIT_TYPE_PRIM_SSCP. The status means that SLI_OPEN has been processed sufficiently to allow SSCP data to now be sent or received.  
  
## Exception Requests  
 If a host application request unit is converted into an EXR, sense data will be returned. When an **SLI_BID** completes with the returned verb parameters set as shown, an EXR conversion occurs.  
  
|Member|Set to|  
|------------|------------|  
|**lua_prim_rc**|OK (0x0000)|  
|**lua_sec_rc**|OK (0x00000000)|  
|**lua_rh.rri**|bit off (request unit)|  
|**lua_rh.sdi**|bit on (includes sense data)|  
  
 Of the seven bytes of data in **lua_peek_data**, bytes 0 through 3 define the error detected. The following table indicates possible sense data and the values of bytes 0 through 3.  
  
|Sense data|Value of bytes 0–3|  
|----------------|------------------------|  
|LUA_MODE_INCONSISTENCY|0x08090000|  
|LUA_BRACKET_RACE_ERROR|0x080B0000|  
|LUA_BB_REJECT_NO_RTR|0x08130000|  
|LUA_RECEIVER_IN_TRANSMIT_MODE|0x081B0000|  
|LUA_CRYPTOGRAPHY_FUNCTION_INOP|0x08480000|  
|LUA_SYNC_EVENT_RESPONSE|0x10010000|  
|LUA_RU_DATA_ERROR|0x10020000|  
|LUA_RU_LENGTH_ERROR|0x10020000|  
|LUA_INCORRECT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER|0x20010000|  
  
 The information returned to bytes 3 through 6 in **lua_peek_data** is determined by the first 3 bytes of the initial request unit that caused the error.
