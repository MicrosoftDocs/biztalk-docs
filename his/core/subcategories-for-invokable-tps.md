# Subcategories for Invokable TPs
The following figure shows subcategories for invokable TPs.  
  
|Queued<br /><br /> or nonqueued|Application<br /><br /> or service|Starting method|  
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------|  
|Queued|Running as an application or a service|Autostarted or operator-started|  
|Nonqueued|Running as an application|Autostarted|  
  
 The concept of a TP "running as a service" or "running as an application" is distinct from a service TP or an application TP. Service TP and application TP are SNA terms that describe how a TP is used: either as a supportive service program for other APPC programs, or directly by a user, as an application. For detailed information about services and applications on Windows, see the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDNÂ®) Platform Software Development Kit.  
  
 To write an autostarted TP so it will run under Windows as a service and also run in a nonqueued way, write a multithreaded program with a [RECEIVE_ALLOCATE](../Topic/RECEIVE_ALLOCATE2.md) always outstanding. See [Invokable TPs](../core/invokable-tps.md).
