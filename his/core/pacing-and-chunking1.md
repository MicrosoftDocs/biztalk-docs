# Pacing and Chunking
The local node supports session pacing inbound and outbound, according to the pacing values in the **BIND** parameters for the session. The application can be involved in outbound pacing through the use of the [Status-Resource](./status-resource1.md) message. Inbound pacing is handled transparently by the local node and need not concern the application.
