# How to Self-Host a Windows-Initiated Process
Self-Hosting is a technology that allows you the option of running a Transaction Integrator (TI) assembly in-process with an associated application. Self-Hosting improves performance of your application by not running the TI assembly through Internet Information Services (IIS).  
  
### To self-host a TI assembly  
  
1.  Create a TI assembly as you would normally.  
  
     For more information, see [Creating an Application with Host Integration Server Designer](../core/creating-an-application-with-host-integration-server-designer1.md).  
  
2.  Register the TI assembly using TI Manager, using the **Self-Host** radio button selected.  
  
     You may also set the hosting model in the Properties toolbox in Visual Studio.  
  
     For more information, see [Creating an Object](./creating-an-object2.md).  
  
3.  In Visual Studio, use Solution Explorer to add a reference to your TI assembly.  
  
4.  Code your application, using the interfaces on the TI assembly as you would any other interface.
