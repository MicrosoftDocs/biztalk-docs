# Object Wizard (for HIP)
The HIP **Object Wizard** helps you define (or browse for) a Transaction Integrator metadata (.tim) file that is executed by Transaction Integrator after a request is received from a host. The .tim file includes information about the following:  
  
-   Windows server object interface, methods, and parameters  
  
-   Characteristics of the host application program  
  
-   Mappings between the host application program and the Windows server object  
  
 If the Windows server object is a .NET Framework object, the wizard also helps you define the assembly and class that implements the interface in the .tim file.
