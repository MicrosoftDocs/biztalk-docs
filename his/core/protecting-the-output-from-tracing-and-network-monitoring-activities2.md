## Overview
To prevent an attacker from viewing the user credential information that might be stored in trace files or network monitoring files, you should:  
  
-   Confirm that only authorized users are allowed to run the SNA TRACE or Microsoft Network Monitoring programs on the computer that is running Transaction Integrator.  
  
-   Store all tracing (Tracebits) output files and network monitoring (Netmon) output files in a secure directory.  
  
-   Confirm that the access permissions are set correctly on all tracing output files and network monitoring output files.  
  
-   Confirm that the access permissions are set correctly on the directory that contains the output files.  
  
-   Delete all tracing output files and network monitoring output files as soon as you are done with them.
