# Get started with the 3270 Design Tool

The 3270 Design Tool helps you generate the Host Integration Designer XML (HIDX) file that's required by the IBM 3270 connector in Azure Logic Apps. The tool also generates C# classes that you can use with Host Integration Server.

This tool helps you record the screens, navigation paths, methods, and parameters for the tasks in your application that you add and run as 3270 connector actions. The tool generates a Host Integration Designer XML (HIDX) file that provides the necessary metadata for the connector to use for driving your mainframe application.
