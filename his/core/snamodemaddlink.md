# SNAModemAddLink
The **SNAModemAddLink** function should be called once per link initialization. For link services that support more than a single SNA link, this call can be made multiple times. For link services that support only a single link, this call can be made immediately after **SNAModemInitialize**; otherwise it is preferable to call **SNAModemAddLink** as each port is initialized.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
            void SNAModemAddLink(Â   
MODEM_STATUS **ppModemStatus);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *ppModemStatus*  
 The address of a pointer to a **MODEM_STATUS** structure that will be used for storing modem status information. The returned **MODEM_STATUS** structure will contain a link service name.  
  
## Remarks  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The IHV should declare a pointer to a **MODEM_STATUS** structure and pass its address to **SNAModemAddLink**.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The **LSName** is initially the name of the link service, but may need to be altered for multiport link services.The IHV can replace the link service name returned in the **MODEM_STATUS** structure to differentiate between possible multiple connections through a single link service.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The IHV should maintain the various input and output signal lines and the data flow frame counts in the returned **MODEM_STATUS** structure. The Microsoft [!INCLUDE[hishostintegrationserver2009](../core/includes/hishostintegrationserver2009-md.md)] Modem Monitor application will periodically read and display the data stored in this **MODEM_STATUS** structure.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Internally **SNAModemAddLink** increments the usage count of the shared memory, and signals the [!INCLUDE[hishostintegrationserver2009](../core/includes/hishostintegrationserver2009-md.md)] Modem Monitor application that a new link has been added.
