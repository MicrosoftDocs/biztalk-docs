# User Management
Although [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] uses the User accounts of the Microsoft Windows Active Directory directory service, users must be configured to use [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] resources such as LUs.  
  
### To create users  
  
1.  In SNA Manager, expand the SNA subdomain where the users reside.  
  
2.  Right-click **Configured Users**, point to **New**, and then click **User**.  
  
3.  Select a user (or group) from the list, and then click **OK**.  
  
### To view active 3270 users  
  
1.  In SNA Manager, expand **Servers**, and then expand the server you are working with.  
  
2.  Click **Active Users**. The results pane shows the active 3270 users and provides details such as **User Name**, **Client**, and **Server**.
