# Application Localities
Applications such as 3270 emulators can enter dynamically into an SNA server system. The application, in conjunction with the Base, acts as a whole locality and communicates with the other localities in the system using a Dynamic Access Module (DMOD).  
  
 The topic [DL-BASE/DMOD Interface](../core/dl-base-dmod-interface.md) describes the interface to the Base and the DMOD that enables an application to participate in an SNA server system.
