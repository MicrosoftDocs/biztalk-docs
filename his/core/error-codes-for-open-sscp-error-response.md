> [!NOTE]
>  The error code 1 values 0x1001 to 0x1011 are returned when the [Open(SSCP) Request](../Topic/Open\(SSCP\)%20Request1.md) specifies a nonforced Open. They do not indicate errors, but indicate that the LU-SSCP session is not active. The application can retry the **Open(SSCP) Request** specifying a forced Open, in which case the local node will attempt to activate the connection if possible.
