# How to Obtain a Single Value from a Host File System
You might need to return database information that is just a single value rather than in the form of a table or data stream. For example, you might want to return the result of an aggregate function such as COUNT(*), SUM(Price), or AVG(Quantity).  
  
### To obtain a single value from the Host File System  
  
1.  Make a call to `HostFileCommand.ExecuteScalar`.  
  
     `ExecuteScalar` returns a scalar value: the value of the first column of the first row of the result set.
