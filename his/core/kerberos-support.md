# Kerberos Support
In addition to NTLM, Kerberos support is now available. To use Kerberos support, it is necessary to set a Service Principal Name (SPN) for each server in the subdomain. You can do this through the command line as follows:  
  
```  
setspn -a hisservice/servername serviceaccount  
```  
  
 An icon will appear in the status bar to verify that the system is using Kerberos. Kerberos support is compatible with previous versions of Host Integration Server.
