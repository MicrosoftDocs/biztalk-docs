# Configuration Changes for Sync Point Support
A new check box is added to the Local LU Configuration dialog box. When selected, this indicates that the local LU is able to participate in **synclevel** Sync Point sessions. Host Integration Server uses this option to determine the **synclevel** BIND parameters it sends on BIND requests and responses.  
  
 This field is added to the Host Integration Server configuration file in a field that is no longer used by Host Integration Server. Existing configurations from earlier versions of Host Integration Server will therefore continue to work unmodified.
