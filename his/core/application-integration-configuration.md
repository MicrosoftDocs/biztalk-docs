# Application Integration (Configuration)
## Overview
Starting with Host Integration Server 2013 TI components for both Windows Initiated Processing (WIP) and Host Initiated Processing (HIP) are saved as .hidx files and compiled by the TI Designer to .dll files.  Also starting with Host Integration Server 2013 configuration for connecting with external host systems is done through a .config file. There is no TI Manager MMC Console, the new TI Configuration Tool is provided to assist with creating and maintaining the .config files.
