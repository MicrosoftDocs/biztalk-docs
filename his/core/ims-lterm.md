# IMS_LTERM
Use the **IMS_LTERM** to override the default LTERM that an Information Management Systems (IMS) connect call uses while processing the host transaction within IMS. The COMTIContext context name is **IMS_LTERM**, and its value must be from one through eight alphanumeric characters.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If the **IMS_LTERM** is assigned more than eight characters, the **IMS_LTERM** value is not passed to the host transaction and the host transaction continues to use the system provided default LTERM.
