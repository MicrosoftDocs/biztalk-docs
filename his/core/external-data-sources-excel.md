# External Data Sources (Excel)
You can use Excel to connect to data from many different data sources and locations, including relational databases, multidimensional sources, cloud services, data feeds, Excel files, text files, and data from the Web. The main benefit of connecting to external data is that you can periodically analyze this data without repeatedly copying the data to your workbook, which is an operation that can be time consuming and prone to error. After connecting to external data, you can also automatically refresh (or update) your Excel workbooks from the original data source whenever the data source is updated with new information.  
  
 Connection information is stored in the workbook and can also be stored in a connection file, such as an Office Data Connection (ODC) file or a Data Source Name file (DSN). We recommend that you use ODC files for connecting to external data from Excel.  
  
 **Office Data Connection (ODC) files**  
  
 You can create ODC files by connecting to external data through the **Select Data Source** dialog box or by using the Data Connection Wizard to connect to new data sources. An ODC file uses custom HTML and XML tags to store the connection information. You can easily view or edit the ODC file in Excel.  
  
 You can convert other connection files, such as DSN, UDL, and query files, to an ODC file by opening the connection file and then clicking the **Export Connection File** button on the **Definition** tab of the **Connection Properties** dialog box.
