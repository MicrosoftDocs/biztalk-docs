# How to Create a 5250 Connection Manually
The following procedure details creating a 5250 connection manually.  
  
### To create a 5250 connection manually  
  
1.  In SNA Manager, expand the server on which to create the connection, and then expand **SNA Service**.  
  
2.  Right-click **Connections**, point to **New**, and then click the type of connection (such as SDLC or 802.2) to be created.  
  
     **Connection Properties** lets you specify which link service to use for the connection, as well as the name of the connection and additional information. The choices you make depend on the purpose of the connection.  
  
3.  Click **OK**.  
  
4.  Right-click **SNA Service**, and then click **Save configuration**.  
  
5.  Stop and then start SNA service.  
  
     To display this dialog box after the connection has been created, double-click the connection in the tree view. Or select the connection and then, on the **View** menu, click **Properties**.
