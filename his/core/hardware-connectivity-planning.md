# Capacity planning and connectivity - HIS

## Overview
When planning your Host Integration Server environment and deployment options, there are some key factors to consider. Some of these include the expected server load and sessions, and planning your hardware to meet these needs. You also need to determine the type of connectivity being made to HIS, and how the client and servers communicate with each other.
