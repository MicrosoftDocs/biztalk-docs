# Administering Sections of HIS (WMI)
Host Integration Server is included with Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) providers that grant administrative access to the following areas:  
  
- Rolling out, configuring, and restoring services  
  
   The [SNA Provider WMI Programmer's Reference](sna-provider-wmi-programmer-s-reference2.md) and [SNA Trace Provider WMI Programmer's Reference](sna-trace-provider-wmi-programmerâ€™s-reference1.md) providers expose information regarding the Setup and rollout procedures for Host Integration Server. You can use instances of classes such as **MsSna_LinkService** to set up and administer link services, and the classes derived from **MsSna_Config** to configure your system. For more information, see [Configuring Host Integration Server with WMI](../core/configuring-host-integration-server-with-wmi2.md).  
  
- Starting and stopping services and connections  
  
   The **WmiSna** provider exposes the **MsSna_Server**, **MsSna_Service**, and **MsSna_Connection** classes. These classes and their derived classes let you add an SNA service, start and stop services, pause services, and start and stop connections. For more information, see [Controlling Services and Connections with WMI](../core/controlling-services-and-connections-with-wmi1.md).  
  
- Health monitoring  
  
   The **WmiSnaStatus** provider exposes information regarding the SNA service status. **WmiSnaStatus** uses a variety of classes derived from **MsSnaStatus_Event** to describe changes in different parts of your system. For more information, see [How to Monitor the Health of Host Integration Server with WMI](../core/how-to-monitor-the-health-of-host-integration-server-with-wmi1.md).  
  
- Trace capturing  
  
   The **WmiSnaTrace** provider supports classes and instances derived from the **MsHisTrace_Config** class, which displays information regarding different configuration files. **WmiSnaTrace** also supports the **MsHisTrace_Event**, which describes an event that occurs whenever a trace is triggered. For more information, see [How to Capture a Trace with WMI](../core/how-to-capture-a-trace-with-wmi1.md).  
  
  Additionally, Microsoft Windows includes several standard WMI providers, such as a registry provider, for accessing information from the system registry. Windows also supplies a Windows Event Log provider that enables applications to receive notifications of Windows and Host Integration Server events and to access the information stored in the Windows event log. Third-party vendors can create custom providers to interact with managed objects specific to their environment.
