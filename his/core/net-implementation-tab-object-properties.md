# .NET Implementation Tab (Object Properties)
Use the **.NET Implementation** tab to view the properties of the .NET assembly implementing the interface defined in the Transaction Integrator metadata (TIM) file.  
  
|Use this|To do this|  
|--------------|----------------|  
|**Assembly path**|Type the full path name, including the .dll extension, to a .NET file, select a recently used file from the list, or click **Browse** and navigate to the file.|  
|**Class**|Select the class containing the methods to be called by HIP runtime for the request processing. The list displays classes from the selected assembly that implement the interface defined in the .TIM file. The first class is selected in the list by default.|  
  
> [!CAUTION]
>  The properties on an object are not intended to be set or changed programmatically. Setting or changing the properties programmatically might cause the object to function incorrectly.
