# Print Session Status
There are several different messages that show the status of a [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../core/includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] print session:  
  
-   Active  
  
-   Inactive  
  
-   Pending  
  
-   In Session: Indicates the print server session is active, and the logical unit (LU) is bound. For Advanced Program-to-Program Communications (APPC), a conversation is allocated.  
  
-   Offline: Indicates the print session has been created, but the print server is not aware of it.  
  
-   Paused: Indicates the print server session is active, but the printing has been paused.  
  
 To view the status of a print session, simply select the print session in SNA Manager.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The status shown by the SNA Manager and the Diagnostic tool (DISPLAY.EXE) may appear to be different for a given item (for example, LU status). This is because the SNA Manager shows the currently active sessions. The Display tool shows what was negotiated during CNOS setup.
