# ADO.NET DataSet for Host Integration Server
The ADO.NET `DataSet` is the object that contains the data that a managed provider retrieves from a remote data source. Specifically, the ADO.NET `DataSet` is a local cache of tables, similar to a collection of ADO disconnected recordsets, described in the `System.Data` namespace. In addition, the `DataSet` records the relationships between the tables using keys and constraints. The `DataSet` is central to supporting disconnected, distributed data scenarios with ADO.NET.
