# OPEN Call
The **OPEN** call has no parameters. It grants access to the driver from a particular process. The driver ensures that only one **OPEN** is accepted by the link at any one time. When **OPEN** is processed, the driver attempts to reserve access to hardware resources such as interrupt vectors. The **OPEN** is rejected if this fails.  
  
 After a successful **OPEN** request, the driver expects to receive the following IOCTL commands:  
  
-   **SET_EVENT_HANDLE**  
  
-   **SET_INTERFACE_RECORD**  
  
-   **SET_LINK_CHARACTERISTICS**  
  
 Of these, the first two can be performed in any order, but both should be issued before calling **SET_LINK_CHARACTERISTICS**.  
  
 When these three calls have been successfully performed by the SNALink, the driver is ready for information transfer.
