# Host Environment Associations Listing
Use the host environment associations listing to view the host environments associated with the view.  
  
 This listing displays the following information about the host environment:  
  
-   **Host Environment**.The name of the host environment.  
  
-   **Type**. The type of network used to communicate with the host environment (either TCP/IP or SNA).  
  
-   **Remote Endpoint Manager**.The IP address of the host or the host name registered in the DNS (for a TCP/IP network); the LU name associated with the host system (for an SNA network).  
  
-   **Comment**.Additional information about the host environment.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  If you view the list in the right pane of TI Manager and change the order of the columns using the **Add/Remove Columns** command on the shortcut menu, the order of the column headings might not be correct after you close and re-open TI Manager. The next time you open TI Manager, the values in the columns are displayed in the new order you set, but the column headings are in the their default order.  
  
 If you observe that the column headings are no longer in the order you set:  
  
1.  Right-click the node, point to **View**, and then click **Add/Remove Columns**.  
  
2.  On the **Add/Remove Columns** dialog box, click **Restore Defaults**.  
  
3.  Click a different node, then click the node you were just working on.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  The columns should now be in their original order.  
  
 Right-click the host environmentname to display the following four options:  
  
-   **Delete**. Deletes the host environment association (not the host environment itself). You can delete the host environment association anytime.  
  
-   **Refresh**. Redraws the screen to show any updates.  
  
-   **Help**. Displays a Help topic (this topic) that explains the items that appear in the TI Manager console and the actions you can take.
