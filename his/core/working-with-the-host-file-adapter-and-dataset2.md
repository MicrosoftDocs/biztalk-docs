# Working with the Host File Adapter and Dataset
A `HostFileDataAdapter` is used to retrieve data from a data source and populate tables within a dataset. The `HostFileDataAdapter` also resolves changes made to the dataset back to the data source. The `HostFileDataAdapter` uses the `HostFileConnection` object to connect to a data source, and it uses `HostFileCommand` objects to retrieve data from and resolve changes to the data source.
