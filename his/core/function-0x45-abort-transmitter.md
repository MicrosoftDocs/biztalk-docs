# Function 0x45: Abort Transmitter
The SNALink calls this function to clear down the driver's transmitter.  
  
## Remarks  
 This request causes the driver to stop the current frame transmission and to flush its internal buffers of any further data pending transmission. In two-wire configurations, the driver should also drop RTS.
