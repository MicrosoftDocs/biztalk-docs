# Configuring Your Enterprise
[Making and Testing a Connection](../core/making-and-testing-a-connection.md) provides the basic steps to configure a link service, make a connection, create logical units (LU), and log on to a host computer; this section follows a similar format and provides the concepts and procedures for configuring [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../core/includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] in your enterprise.
