# Data Types
The Transaction Integrator (TI) run-time environment manages the process of converting host data types used by a host-based transaction program (TP) to and from the Automation data and data types used by a Microsoft Visual Basic or other Windows-based programming language.  
  
 The topics in this section give you tips for handling different types of data, and they explain how data types are converted and used in both IBM host and Automation programming languages.  
  
 TI supports Automation, COM aggregate, and mainframe data types. For a complete listing of the supported data types, see [Supported TI Data Types](../core/supported-ti-data-types.md)
