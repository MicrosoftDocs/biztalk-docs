# Add New Item Dialog Box (Visual Studio)
The **Add New Item** dialog box enables you to add an item to the currently selected project. There are two panes in the dialog box:  
  
-   The **Categories** pane lists the project item hierarchy.  
  
-   The **Templates** pane lists the related project item types.  
  
 When you select an item from the **Categories** list, the appropriate files and references are added to your project. The type of project selected determines the item choices that appear.  
  
 **To add a new item**  
  
1.  On the **Project** menu, click the type of library that you want to add.  
  
2.  On the **Add New Item** dialog box, confirm that the correct template is highlighted.  
  
3.  Next to **Name**, type the name that you want to use for the library.  
  
4.  Click **Add**, and follow the directions for the relevant Wizard.
