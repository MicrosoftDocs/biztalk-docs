# WinAPPCCleanup
The **WinAPPCCleanup** function terminates and deregisters an application from a Windows APPC implementation.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
BOOL WINAPI WinAPPCCleanup(  
void  
);  
  
```  
  
## Return Value  
 The return value specifies whether the deregistration was successful. If the value is nonzero, the application was successfully deregistered. The application was not deregistered if a value of zero is returned.  
  
## Remarks  
 Use **WinAPPCCleanup** to indicate deregistration of a Windows APPC application from a Windows APPC implementation.  
  
 Conversations that are still active will be terminated and TPs ended. This function is equivalent to issuing [TP_ENDED](../core/tp-ended.md) (HARD) on all TPs owned by the application.
