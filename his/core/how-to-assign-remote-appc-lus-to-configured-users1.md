# How to Assign Remote APPC LUs to Configured Users
Although [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] uses the User accounts of the Windows Active Directory directory service, users must be configured to use [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] resources such as LUs.  
  
### To assign remote APPC LUs to a configured user  
  
1.  In SNA Manager, expand the SNA subdomain where the users reside.  
  
2.  Select **Servers**, expand **Servers**, select a server, expand it, and then expand **Remote APPC LUs**.  
  
3.  Select an LU, right-click it, and assign it to a user.  
  
4.  Select the user, and click **OK**.
