# Supported Data Flow Models
Transaction Integrator (TI) supports the following four data flows:  
  
- [Non-transactional Data Flows That Support Bounded Recordsets](../core/non-transactional-data-flows-that-support-bounded-recordsets2.md)  
  
- [Non-transactional Data Flows That Support Unbounded Recordsets](../core/non-transactional-data-flows-that-support-unbounded-recordsets2.md)  
  
- [Transactional Data Flows That Support Bounded Recordsets](../core/transactional-data-flows-that-support-bounded-recordsets1.md)  
  
- [Transactional Data Flows That Support Unbounded Recordsets](../core/transactional-data-flows-that-support-unbounded-recordsets1.md)  
  
  The following table shows the mainframe-based programming models and the data flows that TI supports.
