# SSCP Connection
The system services control point (SSCP) connection of the application to the local node provides access to the SSCP session between the MicrosoftÂ® Host Integration Server secondary logical unit (LU) and the host SSCP.  
  
 For simplicity, this section describes the SSCP connection as if an application only uses a single SNA server LU (and therefore a single SSCP connection). In practice, applications can use multiple LUs.
