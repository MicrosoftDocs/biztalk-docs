# SNAModemTerminate
The **SNAModemTerminate** function should be called once per link service process, at termination. The ideal place is **SNALinkTerminate**. If the link service supports a single link, it is appropriate to call **SNAModemDeleteLink** immediately before **SNAModemTerminate**. Otherwise it is better to call **SNAModemDeleteLink** as each link instance is terminated.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
void SNAModemTerminate();  
  
```
