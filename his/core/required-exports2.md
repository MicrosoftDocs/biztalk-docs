# Required Exports
The IHV link support DLL must export the following entry points:  
  
- [SNALinkInitialize](./snalinkinitialize2.md)  
  
- [SNALinkWorkProc](./snalinkworkproc1.md)  
  
- [SNALinkDispatchProc](./snalinkdispatchproc2.md)  
  
  These are called by the Base scheduler when the SNALink is invoked.
