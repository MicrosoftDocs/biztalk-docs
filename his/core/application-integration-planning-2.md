# Get started with application integration - HIS

## [Transaction Integrator Architecture](transaction-integrator-architecture1.md)  
Details the architecture of transaction integrator (TI), including online processing, basic functions and components, programming models, and host-initiated processing (HIP) and Windows-initiated processing (WIP). Also lists the communication models, and the CICS and VTAM sample definitions.

## [Configure](application-integration-configuration-2.md)
Use Visual Studio to work with the TI designer, use configuration files for WIP and HIP, create the TI projects and applications in Visual Studio and BizTalk Server, and get access to the user guide and conversion tool. 

## [Security](application-integration-security-2.md)
Get details on using single sign-on with Transaction Integrator, limitations, and protecting the different parts and components to limit threats.

## [Troubleshooting and errors](application-integration-troubleshooting-2.md)
Read about common issues and resolutions, and using tracing, debugging, and event logs to help troubleshoot. 

## Developer resources

[Programmer Guide](application-integration-programmerâ€™s-guide2.md) describes the development tools, using type libraries, and creating or programming Windows-initiated processing (WIP) and Host-initiated processing (HIP) applications. 

[Programmer reference](application-integration-programmer-s-reference2.md) includes tips to handle different data types, working with automated and mainframe data, using COMTIContext, and working with request reply messages.
