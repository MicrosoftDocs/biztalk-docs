# Data Type Conversion (Planning)
One of the primary features of Transaction Integrator (TI) is converting and formatting a method's data from the data types understood by the Windows platform into the data types understood by a mainframe transaction program (TP). The conversion is defined at design time and implemented at runtime. At design time, the developer uses the TI Designer to associate a COM or .NET data type with a COBOL or RPG data type. TI provides default mappings between standard COM or .NET data types and COBOL or RPG data types, and the developer can either accept the default mappings or override the default with other mappings supported by TI. The TI Designer records the mappings in the TI component library, and the generated COBOL or RPG data declarations reflect them.
