|-1500|HY000|-1500|**Message**: The maximum number of statements (128) has been reached for the current connection.<br /><br /> **Reason**: The client relies on pre-defined SQL statements in sections within DB2 Static SQL packages to support execution of concurrent SQL SELECT statements. By default, the client defines 128 package sections, allowing the client to execute 128 concurrent SQL SELECT statements per client connection. When the maximum number of outstanding concurrent SQL SELECT statements exceeds the number of pre-defined sections, then the client cannot execute a new SQL SELECT statement.<br /><br /> **Action**: Verify connection information to ensure the Package Collection value matches DB2 collection in which [!INCLUDE[hishostintegrationserver2009](../core/includes/hishostintegrationserver2009-md.md)] packages are defined for execution by current user ID or PUBLIC. For more information, see topic on Package Collection.|  
|-1501|HY000|-1501|**Message**: User has no authority to create (execute) package.<br /><br /> **Reason**: The server cannot execute a SQL SELECT or CALL statement that requires a CURSOR statement stored in a static SQL package to which the current user is not authorized. The client relies on pre-defined SQL statements in sections within DB2 Static SQL packages to support execution of SQL SELECT statements. By default, the client defines a package automatically, if the runtime user has package BIND, EXECUTE, and GRANT authority over the DB2 collection specified in the Package Collection connection property.<br /><br /> **Action**: Verify connection information to ensure the Package Collection value matches DB2 collection in which [!INCLUDE[hishostintegrationserver2009](../core/includes/hishostintegrationserver2009-md.md)] packages are defined for execution by current user identifier or PUBLIC. Manually create [!INCLUDE[hishostintegrationserver2009](../core/includes/hishostintegrationserver2009-md.md)] packages for execution by current user ID or PUBLIC, using Data Access Tool, Data Source Wizard, Data Links, or Data Access Library. Connect to DB2 using an authorization ID that is privileged to automatically create [!INCLUDE[hishostintegrationserver2009](../core/includes/hishostintegrationserver2009-md.md)] packages (CREATE, BIND and EXECUTE privileges). For more information, see topic on Package Collection.|  
|-7049|HY000|-7049|**Message**: Failed to get connection from pool. Application reaches the limit of connections from connection pooling. Max number defined in “MAX POOL SIZE” property.<br /><br /> **Reason**: Client cannot connect to server when the available connections in the client connection pool have been exhausted.<br /><br /> **Action**: Configure a larger max pool size and set a timeout on the pooled connections. For more information, see topic on Max Pool Size.|
