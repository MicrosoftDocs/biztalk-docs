# Sending Messages
The 3270 emulator inserts a message in a buffer and then calls the DL-BASE to send it. The message contains source and destination locality partner indexes (LPIs), which are set up when the connection is opened. For more information, see [LPI Connections](../core/lpi-connections2.md).  
  
 The application can either obtain a new buffer to contain the message to be sent (using [sepdbubl](./sepdbubl1.md)), or reuse a buffer in which it previously received a message. The application is responsible for any buffer it has obtained or in which it has received a message. The application must either use (or reuse) the buffer to send a message or release it (using [sepdburl](./sepdburl2.md)). If the buffer to be reused does not contain the correct number of elements for the message to be sent, the application can obtain additional elements (using [sbpibegt](./sbpibegt2.md)) or release existing ones (using [sbpiberl](./sbpiberl2.md)). In this case, it must also ensure that the **numelts** field in the buffer header indicates the correct number of elements.  
  
 The function used to send the message is [sbpusend](./sbpusend1.md).
