# CONNTIMEOUT
Use the CONNTIMEOUT keyword to reclaim orphaned persistent connections. **CONNTIMEOUT** takes an integer value specifying, in seconds, how long to wait before a persistent connection is considered abandoned and then automatically closed. The timing starts as the client call processing is completed by the COM+ or .NET generic object.
