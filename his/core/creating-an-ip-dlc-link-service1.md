# Creating an IP-DLC Link Service
You create and configure an IP-DLC link service as you would create any other link service.  
  
### To create an IP-DLC link service  
  
1.  In the SNA Manager, locate the computer on which you want to create the IP-DLC link service.  
  
2.  Right-click the **Link Services** folder under that computer.  
  
3.  On the context menu, click **New/Link Service.** The **Insert Link Service** dialog box appears.  
  
4.  From the list of available link services, select **IP-DLC Link Service**.  
  
5.  Click **Add** to load the **IP-DLC Link Service** properties dialog box.  
  
6.  To configure the new link service, follow the steps for [Configuring an IP-DLC Link Service](./configuring-an-ip-dlc-link-service1.md).
