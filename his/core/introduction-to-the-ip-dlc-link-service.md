# Introduction to the IP-DLC Link Service
This section describes the overall architecture of the [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../core/includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] system with IP-DLC link service functionality.  
  
 IP-DLC is a [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../core/includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] feature that provides SNA connectivity for applications using dependent and independent sessions over a native IP network. It implements the HPR/IP protocol, which is also known as HPR over IP or Enterprise Extender. Each SNA packet is transmitted natively across the IP network as a UDP datagram.
