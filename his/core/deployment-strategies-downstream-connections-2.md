# Deployment Strategies (Downstream Connections)
This type of configuration is useful in environments in which the downstream system may be unable to communicate directly with the mainframe because of hardware or network incompatibilities that the intermediate Host Integration Server computer can resolve.  
  
 Using Host Integration Server as a PU concentrator can also help reduce host configuration requirements. LUs from one or more physical units (PUs) can be shared with multiple downstream devices, alleviating the need to configure each downstream device in VTAM on the mainframe system. The result is more efficient use of host resources.
