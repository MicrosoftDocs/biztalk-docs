# Authentication
When Host Integration Server receives a request to access a host resource, such as an LU for a terminal session, the server must have some way to verify the request.  
  
 User validation is a fundamental security issue that you can address using one of two methods: [Domain Authentication](../core/domain-authentication2.md) and [Workstation Authentication](../core/workstation-authentication1.md). The method you choose depends upon the type of service being requested.
