# PowerPivot (SharePoint)
PowerPivot for SharePoint provides a new type of document library that allows rich previews of the reports in your PowerPivot workbooks, the ability to create Reporting Services reports from data in your published PowerPivot workbooks, and the capability of scheduling automatic refresh of your PowerPivot data from external data sources.  
  
 When you create a PowerPivot for Excel workbook, you can share it with others in all of the normal ways that you share files. You can also gain many additional benefits by publishing the file to a SharePoint server that has PowerPivot for SharePoint and Excel Services installed. PowerPivot services on SharePoint add collaboration and document management support for the PowerPivot workbooks that you publish to SharePoint. On the SharePoint server, the Excel and SharePoint services work together to process the workbook. PowerPivot for SharePoint components process the data, and Excel Services renders it in a browser window where other users can analyze the data.
