# Numeric Override Facility
The numeric override facility allows a user to enter non-numeric characters in numeric-only fields.  
  
 To toggle numeric override on and off, press CTRL+N (the CTRL key and the N key simultaneously). When numeric override is on, the number 9 appears in the operator information area at the bottom of the terminal, indicating that non-numeric characters can be entered in numeric-only fields.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Make sure that the host computer will accept non-numeric characters in numeric-only fields before using this facility.
