-   Event ID  
  
-   User  
  
-   Computer  
  
-   Events for various time/dates  
  
### To filter events  
  
1.  Click **Start**, and point to **Programs**.  
  
2.  Point to **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Event Viewer**.  
  
3.  Right-click the appropriate log file (**Application**, **Security**, **System**, **Directory Service**, or **File Replication Service**).  
  
4.  Select **Properties**, and click the **Filter Tab**.
