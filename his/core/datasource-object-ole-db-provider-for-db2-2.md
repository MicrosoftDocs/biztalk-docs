# DataSource Object (OLE DB Provider for DB2)
The **DataSource** object is created by an OLE DB consumer. The **DataSource** object contains the knowledge and ability to connect to DB2 over Advanced Program-to-Program Communications (APPC) and LU 6.2 (through Host Integration Server) or over TCP/IP. The **DataSource** object is used to create one or more **Session** objects.  
  
 The following interfaces of the **DataSource** object are supported by the current version of Microsoft OLE DB Provider for DB2:
