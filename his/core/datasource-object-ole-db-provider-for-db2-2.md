# DataSource Object (OLE DB Provider for DB2)
The **DataSource** object is created by an OLE DB consumer. The **DataSource** object contains the knowledge and ability to connect to DB2 over Advanced Program-to-Program Communications (APPC) and LU 6.2 (through Host Integration Server) or over TCP/IP.
