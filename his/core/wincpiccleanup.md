## Syntax  
  
```  
  
BOOL WINAPI WinCPICCleanup(void);  
```  
  
## Return Value  
 The return value specifies whether the deregistration was successful. If the value is not zero, the application was successfully deregistered. The application was not deregistered if a value of zero is returned.
