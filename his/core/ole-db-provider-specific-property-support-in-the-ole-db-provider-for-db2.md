# OLE DB Provider-Specific Property Support in the OLE DB Provider for DB2
The following table summarizes the provider-specific OLE DB version 2.0 properties in the DB2OLEDB_DBPROPSET_DBINIT property set that are supported by the version of Microsoft OLE DB Provider for DB2 included with Host Integration Server.  
  
|OLE DB Property ID|Description|  
|------------------------|-----------------|  
|DBPROP_DB2OLEDB_APPCMODE|When logical unit (LU) 6.2 (SNA) is selected for the Network Transport Library (DBPROP_DB2OLEDB_NETTYPE), this property is the Advanced Program-to-Program Communications (APPC) mode and must be set to a value that matches the host configuration and SNA server configuration.<br /><br /> Legal values for the APPC mode include QPCSUPP (common system default often used by 5250), #INTER (interactive), #INTERSC (interactive with minimal routing security), #BATCH (batch), #BATCHSC (batch with minimal routing security), #IBMRDB (DB2 remote database access), and custom modes. The following modes that support bidirectional LZ89 compression are also legal: #INTERC (interactive with compression), INTERCS (interactive with compression and minimal routing security), BATCHC (batch with compression), and BATCHCS (batch with compression and minimal routing security).<br /><br /> This VT_BSTR type property normally defaults to QPCSUPP.|  
|DBPROP_DB2OLEDB_CATALOGCOL|The name of the collection where OLE DB Provider for DB2 looks for catalog information. This is the default schema, the "SCHEMA" name for the target collection of tables and views. This property is the Data Schema value when configuring data sources. OLE DB Provider for DB2 uses this default schema to restrict results sets for popular operations, such as enumerating a list of tables in a target collection.<br /><br /> For DB2, the default schema is the target AUTHENTICATION (User ID or "owner").<br /><br /> For DB2/400, the default schema is the target COLLECTION name.<br /><br /> For DB2 Universal Database (UDB), the default schema is the SCHEMA name.<br /><br /> If the user does not provide a VT_BSTR value for DBPROP_DB2OLEDB_CATALOGCOL, the OLE DB provider uses the USER_ID provided at logon. For DB2/400, the driver will use QSYS2 if there is no collection found matching the USER_ID value. Because these values for the default schema are inappropriate in many cases, it is essential that the Default Schema value in the data source be defined.|  
|DBPROP_DB2OLEDB_HOSTCCSID|The CCSID matching the data as represented on the host. This property is required when processing binary data as character data. Character data is converted based on the host column CCSID and default ANSI code page.<br /><br /> This VT_I4 type property defaults to 37 (U.S./Canada).|  
|DBPROP_DB2OLEDB_LOCALLU|When LU 6.2 (SNA) is selected for the Network Transport Library, this property is the name of the local LU alias configured in the SNA server.<br /><br /> This VT_BSTR type property has no default value.|  
|DBPROP_DB2OLEDB_NETADDRESS|When TCP/IP has been selected for the Network Transport Library, this property is used to locate the target host computer. This parameter indicates the IP address or TCP/IP host name alias associated with the DDM server on the host. The network address is required when connecting by using TCP/IP.<br /><br /> This VT_BSTR type property defaults to SNA.|  
|DBPROP_DB2OLEDB_NETPORT|When TCP/IP has been selected for the Network Transport Library, this property is used to locate the target DDM service access port when connecting by using TCP/IP. This parameter represents the TCP/IP port used for communication with the DDM service on the host.<br /><br /> This VT_BSTR type property defaults to 446.|  
|DBPROP_DB2OLEDB_NETTYPE|This property, which represents the dynamic-link library used for transport, designates whether the provider connects through SNA LU 6.2 or TCP/IP for network communication. The possible values for this parameter are TCPIP or SNA.<br /><br /> If TCPIP is selected, values for Network Address (DBPROP_DB2OLEDB_NETADDRESS) and Network Port (DBPROP_DB2OLEDB_NETPORT) are required.<br /><br /> If SNA is selected, values for APPC Local LU Alias (DBPROP_DB2OLEDB_LOCALLU, APPC), Mode Name (DBPROP_DB2OLEDB_APPCMODE), and APPC Remote LU Alias (DBPROP_DB2OLEDB_REMOTELU) are required.<br /><br /> This VT_BSTR type property defaults to SNA.|  
|DBPROP_DB2OLEDB_PACKAGECOL|The name of the Distributed Relational Database Architecture (DRDA) target collection (AS/400 library) where Microsoft OLE DB Provider for DB2 should store and bind DB2 packages. This could be the same as the Default Schema (DBPROP_DB2OLEDB_DEFAULTSCH).<br /><br /> Microsoft OLE DB Provider for DB2, which is implemented as an IBM DRDA Application Requester, uses packages to issue dynamic and static SQL statements. OLE DB Provider for DB2 will create packages dynamically in the location to which the user points using this property ID.<br /><br /> This VT_BSTR type property has no default value.|  
|DBPROP_DB2OLEDB_PCCODEPAGE|The PC Code Page property ID indicates the code page to be used on the computer for character code conversion. This property is required when processing binary data as character data. Character data is converted based on the default ANSI code page configured in Windows.<br /><br /> If this parameter is set to Binary or 65535, no character code conversions will take place.<br /><br /> This VT_I4 type property defaults to 1252 (Latin 1).|  
|DBPROP_DB2OLEDB_PLATFORM|The target DB2 platform property value is used to optimize performance of the OLE DB provider when executing operations such as data conversion.<br /><br /> The following values for this property are supported by OLE DB Provider for DB2:<br /><br /> -   DB2/MVS<br />-   DB2/NT<br />-   DB2/6000<br />-   DB2/400<br /><br /> This VT_BSTR property has a default value of DB2/MVS.|  
|DBPROP_DB2OLEDB_QUALIFIERCOL|The name of the schema (collection/owner) used to fully qualify unqualified object names.<br /><br /> Note that this attribute allows the user to access database objects without fully qualifying the object using a collection (schema) qualifier. The OLE DB provider sends this value to DB2 using a **SET CURRENT SQLID** statement, instructing the DBMS to use this value when locating unqualified objects (for example, tables and views) referenced in SQL statements.<br /><br /> If you do not set a value for default qualifier, no **SET** statement is issued.<br /><br /> This OLE DB property is only valid when connecting to DB2 for MVS (OS/390, z/OS).<br /><br /> This VT_BSTR type property has a default value of .|  
|DBPROP_DB2OLEDB_REMOTELU|When LU 6.2 (SNA) is selected for the Network Transport Library (DBPROP_DB2OLEDB_NETTYPE), this property is the name of the remote LU alias configured in the SNA server.<br /><br /> This VT_BSTR type property has no default value.|  
|DBPROP_DB2OLEDB_TPNAME|This property represents the default transaction program (TP) name for the DB2 DRDA application server (AS), which is 07F6DB (DB2DRDA). However, some DB2 installations may be configured to use an alternate TP name.<br /><br /> Host Integration Server uses the alternate TP name in the off-line demo configuration (DRDADEMO.UDL). In that case, this property is set to 0X07F9F9F9.<br /><br /> This VT_BSTR type property has no default value.|  
|DBPROP_DB2OLEDB_UNITSOFWORK|This property indicates whether two-phase commit (distributed unit of work) used for transactions is supported for this data source. Distributed transactions are handled using Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator, and SNA LU 6.2 Resync Service.<br /><br /> The following values for this property are supported by OLE DB Provider for DB2:<br /><br /> -   Remote unit of work (RUW)<br />-   Distributed unit of work (DUW)<br /><br /> This VT_BSTR type property has a default value of RUW.<br /><br /> Distributed unit of work (two-phase commit) works only with DB2 for OS/390 v5R1 or later. This option also requires that the SNA LU 6.2 service is selected as the network transport.|
