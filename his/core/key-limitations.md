# Key Limitations
The key limitations with the IP-DLC link service implementation are as follows:  
  
-   The IP-DLC link service cannot be run as a distributed link service (DLS).  
  
-   The PU Passthrough and Downstream connections are not supported over IP-DLC connections. It is not possible to have a one-to-one correspondence between upstream and downstream messages where the upstream connection is an IP-DLC connection.  
  
-   Each IP-DLC link service must use a different CP name from the SNA node service.  
  
-   Each IP-DLC link service requires a unique local IP address. If multiple IP-DLC link services are required, each must have its own unique local IP address.  
  
-   A single IP-DLC link service cannot be shared by multiple SNA node services. Each SNA node service must use a different IP-DLC link service for IP-DLC connectivity.
