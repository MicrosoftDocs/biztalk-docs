# Link Definition Information
Link definition information is provided in the **link_def_info_sect** structure as defined below.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
typedef struct link_def_info_sect {  
    unsigned long  link_def_init_sect_len;  
    unsigned short num_link_def;  
    unsigned short total_link_def;  
} LINK_DEF_INFO_SECT;  
```  
  
## Members  
 link_def_init_sect_len  
 The length of the initial link definition information section, including this parameter, up to the first link definition overlay group. The length does not include any previous information sections.  
  
 num_link_def  
 The number of link definitions returned by the **DISPLAY** verb into your program's buffer. This is the number of times the link definition overlay is repeated.  
  
 total_link_def  
 The total number of link definitions. This number is the same as the number returned in the **num_link_def** member except when APPC has more information about link definitions than it can place in the supplied buffer, in which case this number is larger.  
  
 For each link definition, a **link_def_overlay** structure for the link definition is provided as defined below.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
typedef struct link_def_overlay {  
    unsigned long  link_def_entry_len;  
    unsigned char  link_name[8];  
    unsigned char  adj_fq_cp_name[17];  
    unsigned char  adj_node_type;  
    unsigned long  dlc_name[8];  
    unsigned char  adapter_num;  
    unsigned char  dest_addr_len;  
    unsigned char  dest_addr[32];  
    unsigned char  preferred_nn_server;  
    unsigned char  auto_act_link;  
    unsigned char  tg_number;  
    unsigned char  lim_res;  
    unsigned char  solicit_sscp_session;  
    unsigned char  initself;  
    unsigned char  bind_support;  
    unsigned char  ls_role;  
    unsigned char  line_type;  
    unsigned long  eff_capacity;  
    unsigned char  conn_cost;  
    unsigned char  byte_cost;  
    unsigned char  propagation_delay;  
    unsigned char  user_def_1;  
    unsigned char  user_def_2;  
    unsigned char  user_def_3;  
    unsigned char  security;  
    unsigned char  reserv;  
 } LINK_OVERLAY;  
```
