 **atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID)**  
 An acronym that describes the four key properties required of any Windows-based transaction:  
  
-   **Atomic.** Each transaction must execute completely or not at all.  
  
-   **Consistent.** The structural integrity of the transaction database must be maintained.  
  
-   **Isolated.** A transaction cannot access data that is already involved in a transaction.  
  
-   **Durable.** The TP data must be stored securely to enable recovery of the transaction results.

 **authentication**  
 The process of determining the identity of a user attempting to access a system. For example, passwords are commonly used to authenticate users.  
  
 **automatic partnering**  
 A setting for APPC LUs and modes that enables LU-LU pairs (with assigned modes) to be generated automatically by Host Integration Server. Each time a new APPC LU or mode is created with automatic partnering enabled, Host Integration Server searches for existing LUs and modes that also have automatic partnering enabled. Host Integration Server then uses all available automatic partners to create as many unique LU-LU pairs as possible, each pair containing a remote LU, local LU, and assigned mode. Disabling an automatic partner setting after an LU or mode has been created does not remove that LU or mode from LU-LU pairs already generated.

 **implicit incoming mode**  
 A mode that defines the properties to use when Host Integration Server receives a request to start a session, and the mode named in the request is not recognized by Host Integration Server. An implicit incoming mode enables greater flexibility in starting sessions with remote systems.  
  
 For a session to be established, the incoming local LU name must be recognized by Host Integration Server. Then, the incoming remote LU must either be recognized explicitly or handled implicitly (if an implicit incoming remote LU has been configured). If the remote LU is recognized explicitly, but the mode is not recognized (as part of an LU-LU pair), Host Integration Server internally creates a new mode definition with the correct name, using the properties of the implicit incoming mode. Alternatively, if the remote LU is handled implicitly, Host Integration Server also handles the mode implicitly, by internally creating a mode, as described.  
  
 Note that an implicit incoming mode must be configured for any remote LU that will be used as an implicit incoming remote LU. An implicit incoming mode can be (but does not have to be) configured for remote LUs that will only be used explicitly.

 Note that for a session to be established, the local LU name must be recognized by Host Integration Server. If the local LU name is recognized, but the remote LU name is not recognized as a partner for the local LU, Host Integration Server internally creates a new remote LU definition with the correct name, using the properties of the implicit incoming remote LU.  
  
 In SNA Manager, before a remote APPC LU can be used as an implicit incoming remote LU, an implicit incoming mode must be configured for it.

-   Contains one primary server.  
  
-   Can contain up to 14 backup servers.  
  
-   Cannot contain computers running Host Integration Server from other Windows Server domains.  
  
 Host Integration Server Setup requires you to specify the name of the subdomain to which the server will belong. One of the SNA subdomains can have the same name as that of the Windows Server domain in which all the servers operate.  
  
 Because each subdomain can have only one primary server, it is not advisable to implement an SNA subdomain across slow bridges or routers. Multiple servers in a single subdomain can produce unwanted traffic on the wide-area network.  
  
 **SnaBase**  
 The SNA Workstation Process. It is present at all times on personal computers whose users want to participate in the SNA network and on personal computers where dynamic loading is to be performed.  
  
 **SNALink**  
 Link support software that integrates hardware components into a Host Integration Server system. An SNALink is defined when a Host Integration Server system is installed. An SNALink can support only one physical connection from the server.  
  
 **source TP Name**  
 The host system attempts to identify the source of a request for monitoring, reporting, and so on. The source must be a TP name. MSTX is the default, because it is usually a Component Services process.  
  
 **SSCP**  
 *See* **system services control point (SSCP)**.  
  
 **string expression**  
 Any expression that evaluates to a sequence of contiguous characters.  
  
 **stub**  
 An interface-specific object that provides the parameter marshaling and communication required for an application object to receive calls from a client that is running in a different execution environment, such as on a different thread or in another process. The stub is located with the application object and communicates with a corresponding proxy that is located with the client that calls it. In the case of TI, the TI run-time environment serves as the proxy.  
  
 **subdirectory**  
 A directory contained within another directory in a file system hierarchy.  
  
 **subdomain**  
 A collection of computers running Host Integration Server that share a single configuration. A subdomain contains one primary server and can also contain one or more backup servers. All servers in a subdomain must belong to the same Windows domain. *See also***backup server**; **primary server**.  
  
 **SVC**  
 *See* **switched virtual circuit (SVC)**.  
  
 **switched SDLC line**

 **switched virtual circuit (SVC)**  
 A type of circuit used by an X.25 connection, in which the circuit is not constantly active, but is called and cleared dynamically. The destination address is supplied when the circuit is called.  
  
 **Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC)**  
 A type of link service used for managing synchronous data transfer over standard telephone lines (switched lines) or leased lines.  
  
 **synchronous transmission**  
 Transmission in which the data characters and bits are transmitted at a fixed rate, with the transmitter and receiver being synchronized. This eliminates the need for individual start and stop bits surrounding each byte. Both SDLC and X.25 use synchronous transmission.  
  
 **synchronous verb completion**  
 Processing of an SNA verb where the operation of the program is blocked until processing completes. *Contrast with***asynchronous verb completion**.  
  
 **system administrator**  
 A person who configures, maintains the configuration of, helps users diagnose problems with, and manages a computer system. With Host Integration Server, this person can also be the LAN administrator or a TI developer.  
  
 **system services control point (SSCP)**

 **TP**  
 *See* **transaction program (TP)**.  
  
 **trace file**  
 A file containing records of internal activities on the SNA network, including calls made to APIs, the activities of APIs, and the activities of communication links and internal flows.  
  
 **trace message**  
 A message that includes the current status of various COM+ activities, such as startup and shutdown.  
  
 **tracing**  
 The action of tracking the activities of an application programming interface (API), communication links, and internal flows, including the calls made to APIs. Tracing stores a history of activity in trace files.  
  
 **transaction**  
 Data entered into a system (such as a customer deposit to a bank account) triggering a certain action (such as updating an account balance).  
  
 An atomic unit of work in COM-based systems that either succeeds or fails as a whole or a section of a mainframe COBOL transaction program (TP). A mainframe-based transaction is a section of COBOL code within a transaction program (TP) that completes a certain task or set of tasks.  
  
 A mainframe transaction may or may not be an ACID (atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable) transaction. A mainframe-based TP is the actual COBOL program file that contains one or more transactions (sections of COBOL code). A Windows-based transaction is always an ACID transaction that is coordinated by the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (DTC).  
  
 Data entered into a system (such as a customer deposit to a bank account) triggers a certain action or set of actions (such as updating an account balance) that must all occur or that must all not occur; that is, they act as a unit. That unit is called a transaction in Windows-based terminology.  
  
 Each method in a TI component invokes a single mainframe transaction in a mainframe TP. After being invoked, a mainframe transaction can call other transactions in the same or in a different TP.  
  
 **transaction context**  
 An object used to allow a client to dynamically include one or more objects in one transaction.  
  
 **transaction ID**  
 The identifier used to invoke a particular CICS or IMS application (transaction program); in CICS, it is the name of the transaction. A transaction ID (TRANID) can be up to four characters in length. The acceptable characters are A-Z, a-z, 0-9, dollar sign ($), at sign (@), period (.), slash mark (/), hyphen (-), underscore (_), percent sign (%), ampersand (&), question mark (?), exclamation point (!), colon (:), vertical bar (&#124;), quotation mark ("), equal sign (=), caret (^), comma (,), semicolon (;), less than sign (\<), and greater than sign (>).  
  
 **Transaction Integrator (TI)**  
 A Windows server-based program that enables you to integrate mainframe or midrange computer transaction programs with component-based and .NET Framework applications.  
  
 **transaction manager**  
 The transaction manager creates transaction objects and manages their atomicity and durability. Applications request the creation of a transaction object by calling the transaction manager's **BeginTransaction** method.  
  
 **transaction program (TP)**  
 A COBOL-based mainframe transaction program file. An application program that uses Advanced Program-to-Program Communications (APPC) to exchange data with another TP on a peer-to-peer basis. Within the context of TI, a TP is the mainframe-based CICS or IMS program file that a TI Automation server automates. A TP can contain one or more transactions that are managed on the mainframe side. Each method in a single TI Automation server invokes a single TP. That TP then uses the information passed into it by the TI Automation server to determine which mainframe transaction to run within the TP. Each mainframe transaction within a TP can call other transactions. It is dependent upon how the mainframe COBOL application developer has designed the system.  
  
 (1) An application program that uses APPC or CPI-C to exchange data with another TP on a peer-to-peer basis. (2) A program that processes transactions in an SNA network. There are two kinds of transaction programs: application transaction programs and service transaction programs. *See also* **conversation**.  
  
 **Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)**

 **twisted-pair cable**  
 Two paired wires, with each wire twisted two or more times per inch to help cancel out noise.  
  
 **two-phase commit (2PC)**  
 A protocol that ensures that transactions that apply to more than one server are completed on all the servers or none at all. Two-phase commit is coordinated by the transaction manager and supported by resource managers.  
  
 **type library**  
 A file (or component within another file) that contains Automation descriptions of exposed objects, properties, and methods. Object library (.olb) files contain type libraries. Type libraries that are shipped as stand-alone files use the file extension .tlb. A TI component is an example of a type library (.tlb file).  
  
## -U-  
 **UDA**  
 *See* **universal data access (UDA)**.  
  
 **UDT**  
 *See* **user-defined type (UDT)**.  
  
 **unbounded**  
 Refers to recordsets or arrays. In TI, the rows in a recordset or the elements in an array are transmitted one at a time. Therefore, the mainframe application program must issue multiple receives or sends until all data is transmitted.  
  
 This type of parameter or return value can be defined as unbounded for the **CICS Using LU 6.2** and **IMS Using LU 6.2** models only. The number of rows in a recordset or the number of elements in an array is not determined (that is, bounded) before run time. Unbounded parameters or return values can occur anywhere in the Automation method. However, a parameter or return value of this type is always transmitted to and from the mainframe after all other data. TI supports, at most, a single unbounded input parameter and a single unbounded output parameter or a single unbounded in/out parameter.  
  
 **universal data access (UDA)**  
 A Microsoft data access method which supplies access to information across the enterprise. Universal data access provides high-performance access to a variety of information sources, including relational and non-relational, and an easy to use programming interface that is tool and language independent.

 **user name**  
 The name (also known as user ID) that identifies a Windows user account.  
  
 **user-defined type (UDT)**  
 A data type that is defined in a program. User-defined data types generally contain many different data types that are defined by the programming language being used. In COBOL, UDTs are called RECORDS (that is, any declaration containing lower-level numbers).  
  
## -V-  
 **variable-length string**  
 A fundamental data type that holds character information. A String variable can contain approximately 65,535 bytes (64 KB), and it is either fixed-length or variable-length. Strings usually have one character per byte; however, TI supports Unicode BSTR strings that occupy 16 bits per character. Fixed-length strings are declared to be a specific length, and variable-length strings can be any length up to 64 KB, less a small amount of storage overhead.

 **XML**  
 *See* **Extensible Markup Language (XML)**.  
  
 **XML Schema Definition (XSD)**  
 A language proposed by the W3C XML Schema Working Group for use in defining schemas. Schemas are useful for enforcing structure and constraining the types of data that can be used validly within other XML documents. Unlike DTD, which requires its own language and syntax, XSD uses XML syntax for its language. XSD closely resembles and extends the capabilities of XDR. The W3C now recommends the use of XSD as a standard for defining XML schemas.
