# System Overview
This topic outlines key points of the [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../core/includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] implementation of the IP-DLC link service.  
  
-   The IP-DLC link service is configured and managed by the Host Integration Server administrator as for any other link service.  
  
-   To provide the support required for transporting dependent LU sessions across an APPN network, the IP-DLC link service runs the DLUR feature as defined by the SNA/APPN DLUR Architecture Reference. This provides dependent LU session support to a CS/390 host running the matching DLUS feature.  
  
-   The IP-DLC link service operates as a Branch Network Node (BrNN) as defined in the SNA/APPN Branch Extender Architecture Reference. When large numbers of Host Integration Server systems are connected to a mainframe, the Branch Network Node configuration ensures that the overhead of topology and network search traffic on the Host Integration Server and mainframe links is minimalâ€”comparable to using Host Integration Server without the IP-DLC link service.  
  
-   Multiple IP-DLC link services can be configured, one for each local IP address on the Host Integration Server system.  
  
-   Multiple IP-DLC connections are supported for each IP-DLC link service. There is one IP-DLC connection for each PU local to Host Integration Server.  
  
-   Remote independent LUs are associated with an IP-DLC link service instead of a connection. All remote independent LUs accessible through an IP-DLC link service are associated with the single peer connection for the IP-DLC link service. All independent LU traffic is routed by the APPN network and may traverse any active HPR/IP link.
