# Host Integration Server Designer UI
Host Integration Server Designer (HIS Designer) is a graphical user interface that you can use to create Transaction Integrator (TI) components, which are annotated assemblies. You can use HIS Designer to export or import the COBOL and RPG data declarations used in mainframe CICS, IMS programs or OS 400 programs. You can use HIS Designer as a standalone program. It does not require connectivity to the mainframe.  
  
 HIS Designer is hosted within the Visual Studio environment. You can use it to generate both Windows-initiated processing (WIP) and host-initiated processing (HIP) objects. The HIS Designer creates Microsoft .NET Framework assemblies.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[hishostintegrationserver2009](../core/includes/hishostintegrationserver2009-md.md)] no longer supports typelibs. Typelibs created from previous releases of HIS Designer must either be imported into Designer 2010 (using the Designer import wizard)  or processed through the TIConversionTool.exe found within the system directory.
