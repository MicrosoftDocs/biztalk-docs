# How to Modify Objects
After an object has been created and assigned to an application within the host-initiated processing environment, you must be careful when making changes to the object or its Transaction Integrator metadata (TIM) file.  
  
### To safely modify a TIM file for an existing object  
  
1.  In the TI Manager console tree, right click the object to be changed, and then click **Delete**.  
  
2.  Exit TI Manager.  
  
3.  Modify the TIM file and save it.  
  
4.  Start TI Manager.  
  
5.  In the TI Manager console tree, right-click **Objects**, point to **New**, and then click **Object**.  
  
6.  Follow the instructions in the **Object Wizard** to re-create the object.  
  
7.  In the TI Manager console tree, right-click the re-created object, point to **New**, and then click **View**.  
  
8.  Follow the instructions in the **New Object View Wizard** to re-create the object views.
