# Managing Data Input/Output
Most mainframe and midrange transaction programs (TP) rely on a set of input parameters that carry input data, typically provided by a user at a dumb terminal, to the TP. TPs then perform some function with the input data and return output data through their defined output parameters. The primary function of Transaction Integrator (TI) is to manage the process and data conversions necessary to allow input data to be provided to the mainframe TP from a COM or .NET Framework application and to send any output data generated from the TP to a COM or .NET Framework application. To accomplish this, TI provides data type conversion, tabular data definition, and code page translation.
