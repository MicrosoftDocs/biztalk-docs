# Protecting the TI Record or Playback Files from Unauthorized Access

## Overview
To prevent an attacker from either viewing the contents of the Transaction Integrator (TI) record or playback files or replacing those files with ones that could record user data sent to or from the host, you should:  
  
-   Store all TI record and playback files in a secure directory.  
  
-   Confirm that the access permissions on all record or playback files are set correctly. A user must have administrator rights to be able to record and save a file.  
  
-   Confirm that the access permissions are set correctly on the directory that contains the record or playback files are stored.  
  
-   Store the record file in a form other than plain text.
