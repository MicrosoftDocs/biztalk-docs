# Objects

The Objects node is used to match a TI HIP Assembly to the correct HIP Implementation code.

Right-click the Objects node and select New...

Click the top button with the ellipsis (...) to bring up the Open TI HIP Meta Data Assembly window.

Browse to the HIP TI Assembly created using the TI Designer. This assembly defines the data that will be received by the host system and the data that will be returned to the host system.

Click the lower button with the ellipsis to bring up the Open TI HIP Implementing Assembly window.

Browse to the dll that was created in Visual Studio to implement the custom HIP Server code to process the incoming data.
