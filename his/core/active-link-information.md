# Active Link Information
Active link information is provided in the **link_info_sect** structure as defined below.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
typedef struct link_info_sect {  
    unsigned long  link_init_sect_len;  
    unsigned short num_links;  
    unsigned short total_links;  
} LINK_INFO_SECT;  
```  
  
## Members  
 link_init_sect_len  
 The length of the initial active link information section, including this parameter, up to the first link overlay group. The length does not include any previous information sections.  
  
 num_links  
 The number of active links returned by the **DISPLAY** verb into your program's buffer. This is the number of times the link overlay group is repeated.  
  
 total_links  
 The total number of active links. This number is the same as the number returned in the **num_links** member except when APPC has more information about active links than it can place in the supplied buffer, in which case this number is larger.  
  
 For each active link, a **link_overlay** structure for the active link is provided as defined below.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
typedef struct link_overlay {  
    unsigned long  link_entry_len;  
    unsigned char  link_id[12];  
    unsigned long  dlc_name[8];  
    unsigned char  adapter_num;  
    unsigned char  dest_addr_len;  
    unsigned char  dest_addr[32];  
    unsigned char  inbound_outbound;  
    unsigned char  state;  
    unsigned char  deact_link_flag;  
    unsigned char  reserv3;  
    unsigned short num_sessions;  
    unsigned short ru_size;  
    unsigned short reserv4;  
    unsigned char  adj_fq_cp_name[17];  
    unsigned char  adj_node_type;  
    unsigned char  reserv5;  
    unsigned char  cp_cp_sess_spt;  
    unsigned char  conn_type;  
    unsigned char  ls_role;  
    unsigned char  line_type;  
    unsigned char  tg_number;  
    unsigned long  eff_capacity;  
    unsigned char  conn_cost;  
    unsigned char  byte_cost;  
    unsigned char  propagation_delay;  
    unsigned char  user_def_1;  
    unsigned char  user_def_2;  
    unsigned char  user_def_3;  
    unsigned char  security;  
    unsigned char  reserv6;  
 } LINK_OVERLAY;  
```
