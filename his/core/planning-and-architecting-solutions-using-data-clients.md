# Planning and Architecting Solutions Using Data Clients
## Data Clients  
 Microsoft data clients enable enterprise developers to deliver new applications faster with less custom coding through improved productivity using Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 and Microsoft .NET Framework 4, without requiring knowledge of host systems and infrastructure, compared to IBM host development tools and technologies. Microsoft data clients empower knowledge workers and decision-makers to analyze and report vital information faster, by directly accessing host data sources from business intelligence tools within Microsoft Office SharePoint and SQL Server 2012, without needing to schedule host developers to write programs to extract and convert host data structures.  
  
 ![DI&#95;DataClients](../core/media/di-dataclients.jpg "DI_DataClients")  
  
 [!INCLUDE[hishostintegrationserver2009](../core/includes/hishostintegrationserver2009-md.md)] data clients connect new solutions based on Microsoft Windows operating systems with existing information stored in IBM DB2 and Informix database, IBM mainframe and midrange host file systems.  
  
## Data Sources  
 The following table describes the supported platforms and versions.  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|**Data Source**|**Platform and Version**|  
|DB2|IBM DB2 for z/OS, 9.1 and 10<br /><br /> IBM DB2 for i5/OS V5R4, V6R1 and V7R1<br /><br /> IBM DB2 UDB for Windows, AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, Linux V9.7 and V10|

|Host Files|IBM DFSMS DFM z/OS V1.11, V1.12 and V1.13<br /><br /> IBM i5/OS V5R4, V6R1 and V7R1|  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[hishostintegrationserver2009](../core/includes/hishostintegrationserver2009-md.md)] data client integration technologies and tools use IBM and industry-standard protocols and formats to help you connect to the back end data sources. The common IBM architecture is Distributed Data Management (DDM), which IBM has built into DB2 and Informix servers, mainframe z/OS and midrange i5/OS file systems.  
  
## Clients  
 When accessing remote IBM DB2 and Informix database servers, Microsoft technologies operate as industry-standard Distributed Relational Database Architecture (DRDA) Application Requester (AR) clients. To connect to IBM file systems (Host Files), Microsoft technologies operate as IBM-standard Distributed Data Management (DDM) Record-Level Input/Output (RLIO) clients.  
  
|Data Source|Protocol Client|  
|-----------------|---------------------|  
|DB2|Microsoft Client for DRDA (msdrda.dll)|  
|Informix|Microsoft Client for DRDA (msixdrda.dll)|  
|Host Files|Microsoft DDM Client (included in MsHostFileClient provider)|

|Informix|Microsoft OLE DB Provider for Informix|MSINFORMIX|OLE DBADO.NET|Microsoft Visual Basic.NET, Microsoft C#, Microsoft Visual C++|  
|Host Files|Microsoft ADO.NET Data Provider for Host Files|Microsoft.HostIntegration.MsHostFileClient|ADO.NET|Microsoft Visual Basic.NET, Microsoft C#, Microsoft Visual C++|  
  
 ![DI&#95;DataClient1](../core/media/di-dataclient1.png "DI_DataClient1")  
  
 HIS data client for host files can access mainframe sequential, VSAM and partitioned data sets.  
  
 You should use ADO.NET and the .NET Framework to develop all new custom applications to integrate important information stored in IBM DB2 databases and host file systems. ADO.NET and the .NET Framework offer many advantages over OLE. These include the ability to develop XML and Web-aware applications, efficient deployment of Web Services and Windows Communication Foundation Services in addition to making it easy to develop Windows and Web form-based applications.  
  
 ![DI&#95;DataClient2](../core/media/di-dataclient2.png "DI_DataClient2")  
  
 HIS data client for Informix supports an OLE DB Provider for Informix that can be consumed from ADO.NET.  
  
### Entity Data Model  
 Enterprise developers need to extend existing data storage systems, integrating valuable information more efficiently in new applications, without requiring changes to the underlying data store. Microsoft ADO.NET Data Services and Entity Data Model (EDM) provide the data architecture components and tools to enable enterprise developers to deliver new solutions faster, while retaining the data integrity and security of enterprise data stores. Data services provide an isolation layer between the physical data in the data store and the logical data used by applications. Modeling provides a way to work on the information with context associated with a given data-aware application or set of applications.  
  
 ![DI&#95;DataClient3](../core/media/di-dataclient3.png "DI_DataClient3")  
  
 HIS data client for DB2 supports a broad set of data providers, including an Entity Framework Provider for DB2.  
  
 With the ADO.NET Entity Framework and Microsoft Entity Provider for DB2, which sits on top of the Microsoft ADO.NET Provider for DB2, enterprise developers can create data access applications by programming against a conceptual application model instead of programming directly against the DB2 storage schema. Using EDM with the Entity Provider for DB2, enterprise developers can deliver solutions faster, while decreasing the amount of code and maintenance required for data-aware applications.
