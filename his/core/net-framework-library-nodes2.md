# .NET Framework Library Nodes
When you view a .NET library (.dll for client and .tim for server) from within a TI Project, the Visual Studio design environment displays the objects in the library in a tree view in the left pane and list view in the right pane. Double-click the node to expand the node and right-click the node to display a shortcut menu.  
  
 The topics in this section describe the functionality of each menu and each command in the navigation tree.
