# Dispatcher (SNADIS)
Whenever a Base event occurs, the Base calls the link support code dispatcher function [SNALinkDispatchProc](../Topic/SNALinkDispatchProc1.md) to handle the event. The term Base event in this context means:  
  
-   A message arriving from a local 2.1 node.  
  
-   A Base timer tick occurringâ€”this relatively slow event happens approximately every five seconds.  
  
-   Losing contact with a local 2.1 node (for example, the machine being powered down).  
  
 The **SNALinkDispatchProc** function should examine parameters passed to it by the Base to determine why it has been called (for details, see [Sample Code for SNALinkDispatchProc](../core/sample-code-for-snalinkdispatchproc.md)) and call an appropriate function to handle the event. When the event has been processed, control returns to the Base scheduler.
