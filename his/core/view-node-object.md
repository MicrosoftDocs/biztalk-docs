# View Node (object)
Use the ***view*** node to restrict access to object methods based on the host environment calling the object and the local environment receiving the call. You also use the ***view*** node to define the resolution criteria used to direct the call made from a host environment to a server object.  
  
 Double-click the ***view*** node to expand the node. The right pane displays either the host environments (HE) associated with the object view or the methods on the object view, depending upon the choice you select on the shortcut menu.  
  
 Right-click the ***view*** node to display the following seven options:  
  
-   **List**.An object view can have one or more host environments and one or more methods associated with it. To accommodate a list of all the properties of an object view, this shortcut menu item enables you to select which properties are to be viewed in the list view.  
  
    -   **HE Associations**.Displays the host environments associated with the object view on the application.  
  
    -   **Methods**.Displays the methods associated with the object view.  
  
-   **Delete**. Deletes the object view.  
  
-   **Rename**. Renames the selected object view. The new name is reflected across all elements of the HIP console  
  
-   **Refresh**. Redraws the screen to show any updates.  
  
-   **Export List**. Allows you to save the list of views as a separate text or Unicode text file.  
  
-   **Properties**. Displays the ***view* Properties** dialog box and three tabbed property pages:  
  
    -   **General**  
  
    -   **Host environments**  
  
    -   **Methods**  
  
     Use these property pages to view or change the properties of the object view.  
  
-   **Help**. Displays a Help topic (this topic) that explains the items that appear in the TI Manager console and the actions you can take.
