# Linking
The IHVLINK.LIB library must be linked with the application. It contains the Base, DMOD imports, and diagnostics routines. The DMOD and the Base are implemented as DLLs.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The Host Integration Server library only contains the external references for the corresponding DLLs, which are part of the main Host Integration Server product.
