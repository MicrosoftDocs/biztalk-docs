# Introduction to APPC
This section introduces the fundamental concepts of Advanced Program-to-Program Communications (APPC) in a distributed processing environment. These concepts include the following:  
  
-   APPC verbs  
  
-   Microsoft® Windows® APPC extensions  
  
-   Using APPC verbs in C programs  
  
-   Operating system considerations  
  
 Detailed descriptions of APPC verbs are provided in:  
  
-   [APPC Management Verbs](../Topic/APPC%20Management%20Verbs2.md)  
  
-   [APPC TP Verbs](../Topic/APPC%20TP%20Verbs1.md)  
  
-   [APPC Conversation Verbs](../Topic/APPC%20Conversation%20Verbs2.md)  
  
 APPC is an application programming interface (API) that enables peer-to-peer communications in a Systems Network Architecture (SNA) environment. Through APPC, programs distributed across a network can work together, communicating with each other and exchanging data, to accomplish a single processing task such as querying a remote database, copying a remote file, or sending and receiving electronic mail.
