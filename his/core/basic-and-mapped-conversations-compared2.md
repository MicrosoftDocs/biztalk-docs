# Basic and Mapped Conversations Compared
The following table offers some guidelines for choosing between basic and mapped conversations for your TPs. For definitions of basic and mapped conversations, see [Fundamental Terms for TPs and LUs](../core/fundamental-terms-for-tps-and-lus2.md).  
  
|Characteristic|Basic conversations|Mapped conversations|  
|--------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|  
|Common use|Generally used for service TPs.|Generally used for application TPs.|  
|Partnering|Must be used to communicate with an existing TP that uses basic verbs.|Must be used to communicate with an existing TP that uses mapped verbs.|  
|Sending and receiving method|Before a TP can begin a send operation, it must convert data records into logical records. The TP does this by adding a 2-byte prefix that indicates the length of the record. A TP can send several logical records at one time.<br /><br /> When a partner TP receives logical records, it must reconstruct them into usable data records. For more information, see [Logical Records Used in Basic Conversations](../core/logical-records-used-in-basic-conversations2.md).|A TP sends data one record at a time. Neither the sending TP nor the receiving TP needs to convert data records between different forms.|  
|Abnormal termination|In the [DEALLOCATE](./deallocate2.md) verb, a TP can indicate whether an error or ABEND (abnormal program termination) was caused by a TP or by a program using the TP.|A TP can indicate an error or ABEND, but cannot tell whether a problem was caused by a TP or by a program using a TP.|  
||A TP can indicate whether an ABEND was caused by a timeout or by a critical error.|A TP cannot indicate the cause of an ABEND.|  
|Error logging|For an error or ABEND, a TP can send an error message, in the form of a general data stream (GDS) error log variable, to the local log and to the partner LU.|For an error or ABEND, a TP cannot send an error message to the local log or to the partner LU.|
