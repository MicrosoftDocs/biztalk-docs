# Creating and Configuring Connections
You can create connections between [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] and your host computer with wizards or manually. [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] provides three wizards to help you install and configure connections to your host environment (HE).  
  
 The AS/400 Wizard, the Mainframe APPC/LU 6.2 Wizard, and the 3270 Wizard step you through configuring connection properties, creating 3270 display LUs and an LU pool, and assigning the LUs to the LU pool.  
  
 The following procedures detail how to create connections:  
  
## IP-DLC Link Service  
 For information on configuring an IP-DLC Link Service, see [Configuring an IP-DLC Link Service](../core/configuring-an-ip-dlc-link-service1.md) in this section.  
  
 For more information about the IP-DLC Link Service, see [IP-DLC Link Service](./ip-dlc-link-service2.md).  
  
## Mainframe (3270) environments:  
  
-   [Creating a 3270 Connection Using a Wizard](../core/creating-a-3270-connection-with-a-wizard1.md)  
  
-   [Creating a 3270 Connection Manually](../core/how-to-create-a-3270-connection-manually1.md)  
  
## AS/400 (5250) environments:  
  
- [Creating a 5250 Connection Using a Wizard](../core/creating-a-5250-connection-with-a-wizard2.md)  
  
- [Creating a 5250 Connection Manually](../core/how-to-create-a-5250-connection-manually2.md)  
  
- [Creating a 5250 Local APPC LU](../core/how-to-create-a-5250-local-appc-lu1.md)  
  
- [Creating a 5250 Remote APPC LU](../core/how-to-create-a-5250-remote-appc-lu1.md)  
  
  If you use a wizard to create your connections, most of the configuration information is added along with the criteria you entered when the wizard runs.  
  
  If you need to configure a connection manually, you may need to verify some of your connection information. See [Make a connection](making-a-connection2.md).
