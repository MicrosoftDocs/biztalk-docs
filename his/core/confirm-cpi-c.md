# Confirm (CPI-C)
The **Confirm** call (function name **cmcfm**) sends the contents of the send buffer of the local logical unit (LU) and a confirmation request to the partner program and waits for confirmation. For Microsoft Windows, run a background thread for all CPI-C communications and preserve the foreground thread for user interface only.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
CM_ENTRY Confirm(Â   
  unsigned char FAR *conversation_ID,    
    CM_INT32 FAR *request_to_send_received,    
  CM_INT32 FAR *return_code              
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *conversation_ID*  
 Supplied parameter. Specifies the identifier for the conversation. The value of this parameter was returned by [Initialize_Conversation](../core/initialize-conversation-cpi-c.md) or [Accept_Conversation](../core/accept-conversation-cpi-c.md).  
  
 *request_to_send_received*  
 Returned parameter. Provides the request-to-send-received indicator. Possible values are:  
  
 CM_REQ_TO_SEND_RECEIVED  
 The partner program issued [Request_To_Send](../core/request-to-send-cpi-c.md), which requests the local program to change the conversation to RECEIVE state.  
  
 CM_REQ_TO_SEND_NOT_RECEIVED  
 The partner program did not issue **Request_To_Send**. This value is not relevant if *return_code* is set to CM_PROGRAM_PARAMETER_CHECK or CM_PROGRAM_STATE_CHECK.  
  
 *return_code*  
 The code returned from this call. The valid return codes are listed later in this topic.  
  
## Return Codes  
 CM_OK  
 Primary return code; the call executed successfully. The partner program issued the [Confirmed](../core/confirmed-cpi-c.md) call.  
  
 CM_OPERATION_NOT_ACCEPTED  
 Primary return code; a previous operation on this conversation is incomplete.  
  
 CM_OPERATION_INCOMPLETE  
 Primary return code; the operation has not completed (processing mode is nonblocking only) and is still in progress. The program can issue [Wait_For_Conversation](../core/wait-for-conversation-cpi-c.md) to await the completion of the operation, or [Cancel_Conversation](../core/cancel-conversation-cpi-c.md) to cancel the operation and conversation. If [Specify_Windows_Handle](../core/specify-windows-handle-cpi-c.md) has been called, the application should wait for notification by a Windows message and not call **Wait_For_Conversation**.  
  
 CM_PROGRAM_PARAMETER_CHECK  
 Primary return code; one of the following occurred:  
  
-   The value specified by *conversation_ID* is invalid.  
  
-   The local program attempted to use **Confirm** in a conversation with a synchronization level of CM_NONE. The synchronization level must be CM_CONFIRM.  
  
 CM_PROGRAM_STATE_CHECK  
 Primary return code; one of the following occurred:  
  
-   The conversation was not in SEND or SEND_PENDING state.  
  
-   The basic conversation for the local program was in SEND state, and the local program did not finish sending a logical record.  
  
 CM_PRODUCT_SPECIFIC_ERROR  
 Primary return code; a product-specific error occurred and has been logged in the products error log.  
  
 CM_CONVERSATION_TYPE_MISMATCH  
 Primary return code; the partner LU or program does not support the conversation type (basic or mapped) specified in the allocation request.  
  
 CM_PIP_NOT_SPECIFIED_CORRECTLY  
 Primary return code; the allocation request was rejected by a non-CPI-C LU 6.2 transaction program (TP). The partner program requires one or more PIP data variables, which are not supported by CPI-C.  
  
 CM_SECURITY_NOT_VALID  
 Primary return code; the user identifier or password specified in the allocation request is not accepted by the partner LU.  
  
 CM_SYNC LEVEL_NOT_SUPPORTED_PGM  
 Primary return code; the partner program does not support the synchronization level specified in the allocation request.  
  
 CM_TPN_NOT_RECOGNIZED  
 Primary return code; the partner LU does not recognize the program name specified in the allocation request.  
  
 CM_TP_NOT_AVAILABLE_NO_RETRY  
 Primary return code; the partner LU cannot start the program specified in the allocation request because of a permanent condition. The reason for the error may be logged on the remote node. Do not retry the allocation until the error has been corrected.  
  
 CM_TP_NOT_AVAILABLE_RETRY  
 Primary return code; the partner LU cannot start the program specified in the allocation request because of a temporary condition. The reason for the error may be logged on the remote node. Retry the allocation.  
  
 CM_PROGRAM_ERROR_PURGING  
 Primary return code; one of the following occurred:  
  
-   While in RECEIVE or CONFIRM state, the partner program issued [Send_Error](../core/send-error-cpi-c.md). Data sent but not yet received is purged.  
  
-   While in SEND_PENDING state with the error direction set to CM_RECEIVE_ERROR, the partner program issued **Send_Error**. Data was not purged.  
  
 CM_RESOURCE_FAILURE_NO_RETRY  
 Primary return code; one of the following occurred:  
  
-   The conversation was terminated prematurely because of a permanent condition. Do not retry until the error has been corrected.  
  
-   The partner program did not deallocate the conversation before terminating normally.  
  
 CM_RESOURCE_FAILURE_RETRY  
 Primary return code; the conversation was terminated prematurely because of a temporary condition, such as modem failure. Retry the conversation.  
  
 CM_DEALLOCATED_ABEND  
 Primary return code; the conversation has been deallocated for one of the following reasons:  
  
-   The remote program issued [Deallocate](../core/deallocate-cpi-c.md) with the type parameter set to CM_DEALLOCATE_ABEND. If the conversation for the remote program was in RECEIVE state when the call was issued, information sent by the local program and not yet received by the remote program is purged.  
  
-   The partner program terminated normally but did not deallocate the conversation before terminating.  
  
 CM_DEALLOCATED_ABEND_SVC  
 Primary return code; the conversation has been deallocated for one of the following reasons:  
  
-   The partner program issued **Deallocate** with the type parameter set to ABEND_SVC.  
  
-   The partner program did not deallocate the conversation before terminating.  
  
 If the conversation is in RECEIVE state for the partner program when this call is issued by the local program, data sent by the local program and not yet received by the partner program is purged.  
  
 CM_DEALLOCATED_ABEND_TIMER  
 Primary return code; the conversation has been deallocated because the partner program issued **Deallocate** with the type parameter set to ABEND_TIMER. If the conversation is in RECEIVE state for the partner program when this call is issued by the local program, data sent by the local program and not yet received by the partner program is purged.  
  
 CM_SVC_ERROR_PURGING  
 Primary return code; while in SEND state, the partner program or partner LU issued [Send_Error](../core/send-error-cpi-c.md) with the type parameter set to SVC. Data sent to the partner program may have been purged.  
  
 **State Changes**  
  
 The conversation can be in SEND or SEND_PENDING state when **Confirm** is issued.  
  
 State changes, summarized in the following table, are based on the value of the *return_code* parameter.  
  
|*return_code*|New state|  
|--------------------|---------------|  
|CM_OK|No change|  
|Call was issued in SEND state|No change|

## Remarks  
 In response to **Confirm**, the partner program normally issues [Confirmed](../core/confirmed-cpi-c.md) to confirm that it has received the data without error. (If the partner program encounters an error, it issues [Send_Error](../core/send-error-cpi-c.md) or uses [Deallocate](../core/deallocate-cpi-c.md) to abnormally deallocate the conversation.)  
  
 The program can issue **Confirm** only if the conversations synchronization level is CM_CONFIRM.  
  
 **Confirm** waits for a response from the partner program. A response is generated by one of the following CPI-C calls in the partner program:  
  
-   Confirmed  
  
-   Send_Error  
  
-   5Deallocate with the conversations deallocate type set to CM_DEALLOCATE_ABEND
