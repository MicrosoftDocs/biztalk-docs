# Defining a TCP/IP Remote Environment
The following table shows how you can define a TCP/IP remote environment (RE) to fit each of the five mainframe-based programming models even though there are only two Transaction Integrator (TI) RE types.  
  
|TI Remote Environment Type|Mainframe Programming Model|  
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|  
|CICS and IMS using TCP/IP|CICS Concurrent Server (TCP/IP)|  
|CICS and IMS using TCP/IP|CICS MS Link (TCP/IP)|  
|IMS Connect or OTMA|IMS Connect or OTMA (TCP/IP)|  
  
 Use TI Manager to define either TCP/IP RE.
