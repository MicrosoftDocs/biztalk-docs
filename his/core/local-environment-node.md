-   **Endpoint**. The endpoints used to communicate with the host.  
  
 Right-click the ***local environment*** node to display the following five options:  
  
-   **View**. Displays the following menu items:  
  
    -   **Add/Remove Columns**. Allows you to choose the properties that are displayed in the list view. You can display each property as a separate column in the right pane.  
  
    -   **Large Icons**. Displays large icons for items in the right pane.  
  
    -   **Small Icons**. Displays small icons for items in the right pane.  
  
    -   **List**. Displays only the small icons and the names of the nodes in the right pane.  
  
    -   **Detail**. Displays the small icons and the properties of the nodes in the right pane.  
  
    -   **Customize**. Allows you to change the options to show or hide items displayed in the right pane.  
  
-   **Refresh**. Redraws the screen to show any updates.

-   **Properties**. Displays the ***view* Properties** dialog box and three tabbed property pages:  
  
    -   **General**  
  
    -   **Endpoints**  
  
    -   **Application**  
  
     Use the property pages to view or change the properties of the local environment.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can also view the ***local environment* Properties** dialog from within the ***application*** node. However, all LE properties are read-only when viewed from an application. The **Application** tab appears on the property page when the dialog box is viewed from an application.
