# BizTalk Adapter for DB2 Configuration - HIS

## Overview
The Microsoft BizTalk Adapter for DB2 connects BizTalk Server to vital data stored in IBM mainframe DB2 for z/OS, IBM midrange DB2 for i5/OS, and IBM server DB2 running on Linux, UNIX and Windows operating systems. The adapter is based on the Microsoft ADO.NET Data Provider for DB2 and supports a broad range of functions, including send ports and receive ports with distributed transactions across SNA and TCP/IP network connections. Using SQL commands defined within port configuration wizards, IT professionals can easily create solutions that efficiently integrate DB2 databases without writing code.  

 The adapter serves two main functions:  

- For **Send** operations (both One Way and Solicit Response), the adapter sends SQL commands and stored procedures to a DB2 instance, with the option of soliciting a response.  

- For **Receive** operations (One Way only), the adapter creates an SQL command or stored procedure that polls DB2 objects and creates per-row messages, which are then submitted to the BizTalk message system.  

  In addition, the BizTalk Adapter for DB2 uses the standard BizTalk Adapter tracing tool as a troubleshooting mechanism.  

## Create a DB2 send port
Sign in with an account that is a member of the BizTalk Server Administrators group.

1. In **BizTalk Server Administration**, expand **BizTalk Group**, expand **Applications**, and then select your application.

2. Right-click **Send Ports**, select **New**, and then select **Static One-way Send Port**.  

3. In the **Send Port Properties**, set the **Transport Type** to **DB2**. Select **Configure**, and enter the following properties:  


   |            Use this            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      To do this                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
   |--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   |     **BulkCopyBatchSize**      |                                                                                                                                   The **BulkCopyBatchSize** property instructs the Adapter the number of rows to process per batch transaction. This **optional** property accepts an **integer** value. The default value is **20**. A value of **0** instructs the Adapter to process all rows in a single batch.                                                                                                                                   |
   |       **CommandTimeout**       |                                                                                                         The **CommandTimeout** property sets the wait time before the Adapter terminates an attempt to execute a command and then generate an error. This **optional** property accepts an **integer** value. The default value is **30** seconds. A value of 0 indicates no limit (an attempt to execute a command will wait indefinitely).                                                                                                          |
   |     **Connection String**      |                                                The name of a connection string that is used to connect to the DB2 database.<br /><br /> To configure a new or existing Connection String, click the ellipsis (**…**). This starts the Data Source Wizard.<br /><br /> To access Help, click **Help** on the wizard pages, or open the [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] Help and look in [Data Source Wizard (DB2)](../core/data-source-wizard-db2-2.md).                                                |
   |     **DB2 Set Registers**      | The **DB2 Set Registers** property instructs the Adapter to execute one or more SQL SET statements. This optional property accepts a **string** value. The default value is an **empty string**, which denotes no statement. The supported syntax is a semi-colon delimited list of SET statement commands with a comma separate list of SET statement values “\<SET command 1> space \<SET value 1> semi-colon; \<SET command 2> space \<SET value a> comma \<SET value b> semi-colon”). For example, enter “SET CURRENT PATH 'DSN8910', 'HISDEMO'”. |
