# Starting a Conversation
The calls in this category are used to start a conversation between two programs.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The names of the calls are pseudonyms. The actual C function names appear in parentheses after the pseudonyms. For example, **Accept_Conversation** is the pseudonym for a call. The actual function name is **cmaccp**.  
  
 [Accept_Conversation](../Topic/Accept_Conversation%20\(CPI-C\)1.md)( **cmaccp**)  
 Issued by the invoked program to accept the incoming conversation and set certain conversation characteristics. Upon successful execution of this call, Common Programming Interface for Communications (CPI-C) generates a conversation identifier.  
  
 [Allocate](../Topic/Allocate%20\(CPI-C\)1.md)( **cmallc**)  
 Issued by the invoking program to allocate a conversation with the partner program, using the current conversation characteristics. CPI-C can also start a session between the local logical unit (LU) and partner LU if one does not already exist. The type of conversation allocated depends on the conversation type characteristicâ€”mapped or basic.  
  
 [Initialize_Conversation](../Topic/Initialize_Conversation%20\(CPI-C\)2.md)( **cminit**)  
 Issued by the invoking program to obtain a conversation identifier and to set the initial values for the conversation's characteristics. The initial values are derived from side information associated with the symbolic destination name or are CPI-C defaults.  
  
 After issuing **Initialize_Conversation**, the invoking program can issue any of the following **Set_** calls to change the initial conversation characteristics. These calls cannot be issued after **Allocate** has been issued.
