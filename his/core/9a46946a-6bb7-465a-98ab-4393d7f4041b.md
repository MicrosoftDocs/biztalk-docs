# Configure a New Security Policy Wizard Page (in the New Application Deployment Wizard) (2)
Use the second **Configure a New Security Policy** wizard page to identify the source of the host user ID and password and describe how they are translated into Windows-based credentials. This wizard page appears only if **Host-initiated Single Sign-on** (SSO)is selected on the previous **Configure a new security policy** wizard page.  
  
|Use this|To do this|  
|--------------|----------------|  
|**Security policy**|View the name of the security policy.|  
|**Affiliate application**|Select the SSO affiliate application to be queried to gain access to the Windows credentials needed to execute methods on the server object. The list displays all the affiliate applications defined in the SSO. The display name of the affiliate application is a concatenation of the affiliate application name and description, separated by a hyphen. The selected application will be added to the security policy. **Note:**  The dropdown list and **Next** are disabled if SSO is not installed or is not available.|  
|**Single Sign-on mapping use**|Specify the credentials to be used when mapping to Single Sign-on.|  
|**Default credentials**|Select this option to enter the user ID and password used if the request from the host does not contain a user ID and password or the user ID and password are set to spaces or nulls. This option enables the **Group application** and **User** boxes.|  
|**Group application**|The default user group provides the default user ID and password.|  
|**User**|Type or select the host user name used in the lookup call to SSO. **Note:**  The dropdown list and Next are disabled if SSO is not installed or is not available.|
