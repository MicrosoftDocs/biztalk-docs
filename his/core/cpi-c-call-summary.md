# CPI-C Call Summary
This section briefly describes each Common Programming Interface for Communications (CPI-C) call. The features provided by a CPI-C call can be broader than this section indicates. The calls are grouped in categories according to the function they perform. There are calls that start and stop a conversation, send and receive data, get information, and get side information.  
  
 This section contains:  
  
-   [Starting a Conversation](../core/starting-a-conversation.md)  
  
-   [Sending Data](../core/sending-data.md)  
  
-   [Receiving Data](../core/receiving-data.md)  
  
-   [Confirming Receipt of Data and Reporting Errors](../core/confirming-receipt-of-data-and-reporting-errors.md)  
  
-   [Getting Information](../core/getting-information.md)  
  
-   [Ending a Conversation](../core/ending-a-conversation.md)
