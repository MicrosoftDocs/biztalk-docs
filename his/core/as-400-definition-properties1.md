## IBM i Definition Properties: IP Address List  

You can associate this LUA to a specific IP address or server name. The IP address for an incoming connection is compared to each of the available LUs or pools in turn. Each resource has an associated list of IP address patterns and subnet masks. The IP address from the incoming connection is masked (by bit and by the resource's subnet mask) and is then compared to the resource's IP address pattern masked by the resource's subnet mask. If the result is equal, the connection is allocated to this resource.

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Add Address** | Select to specify the **IP Address** and **Subnet Mask** for the client workstation to where you're granting access. <br><br>**Note**: If you want to assign a specific IP address, you must change the IP address from the default value of 0.0.0.0. If you try to add the default IP address with the default subnet mask value, you will receive a message that indicates an invalid IP address or subnet mask. |
| **IP Address** | To edit the IP address for a client workstation, select an entry in the **IP Address** column. |
| **Subnet Mask** | To edit the subnet mask for a client workstation, select an entry in the **Subnet Mask** column. |
| **Add Name** | Select to add a workstation name to the **IP Address** list box. The workstation name identifies that a client workstation whose address resolves to that name can connect to the service. |
| **Remove** | Select to remove an entry that is currently highlighted in the **IP Address** list box. |
| **Clear All** | Select to remove all entries in the **IP Address** list box. The service is then configured to allow access from any client workstation. |
