# Remote Environments
The Remote Environments folder contains definitions for the non-Windows host computers that will receive requests from the Windows-initiated processing (WIP) components. These host definitions are referred to as remote environments or REs.  
  
 The RE is used by the WIP Runtime for the following primary purposes:  
  
-   Define the code page used by the host.  
  
-   Define the data conversion object that will be used by the WIP Runtime.  
  
 Properties on each RE define the characteristics of the host that will be receiving requests.  
  
## REs Supported by WIP  
 WIP supports multiple types of REs (for backward compatibility reasons, there are not just two, as in host-initiated processing).  
  
 The following is a minimum set of REs that is supported:  
  
-   CICS and IMS using TCP/IP  
  
-   CICS LINK using LU6.2  
  
-   CICS using LU6.2  
  
-   IMS Connect  
  
-   IMS using LU6.2  
  
 Each of the previous RE types has a (possibly) unique collection of properties, some of which are in conjunction with the Host Security functionality.  
  
### TCP/IP RE Properties  
 The basic TCP/IP RE properties contain the following:  
  
-   IP Address or Host Name  
  
-   Port List  
  
-   Receive timeout value  
  
-   Locale and Code Page  
  
-   Windows Security Context to be used (User or Package)  
  
## SNA RE Properties  
 The basic SNA RE properties contain the following:  
  
-   Local and Remote LU Aliases, Mode Name  
  
-   Receive timeout value  
  
-   Support for Sync Level 2  
  
-   Locale and Code Page  
  
-   Windows Security Context to be used (User or Package)
