# Configuring SQL Server Connections
The DRDA Service communicates to upstream local or remote SQL Server databases using the ADO.NET Framework Provider for SQL Server. The underlying SQL Client access SQL Server via an in-memory connection, or across a network using either Named Pipes or TCP/IP. The SQL Client supports optional encryption and failover features to improve security and reliability. The DRDA Service supports optional single sign-on and pooling features to improve security and performance. You can edit the MsDrdaService.exe.config file to instruct the DRDA Service on how to manage the SQL client to SQL Server connections.  
  
### Network  
 The DRDA Service connects to SQL Server through the Microsoft ADO.NET Framework Provider for SQL Server and underlying SQL Client. The **database** element of the MsDrdaService.exe.config file contains the network settings for managing out-bound SQL client connections. The database type is the Microsoft.HostIntegration.Drda.RDB.SqlDatabase, which defines the network settings for out-bound SQL client connections.  
  
#### Connection String  
 The **connectionString** attribute defines the list of argument name and value pairs for use by the DRDA Service in defining a Microsoft ADO.NET Framework Data Provider for SQL Server connection object. This **required** attribute accepts a **string** value. The default value is **Data Source=localhost;Integrated Security=true;MultipleActiveResultSets=true**.

This **optional** attribute accepts an **integer** value. Valid values are greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 2147483647. A value of 0 indicates no limit (an attempt to execute a command will wait indefinitely). The default value is **30** seconds.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This timeout value is the cumulative time-out for all network reads during command execution or processing of the results. A timeout can still occur after the first row is returned, and does not include user processing time, only network read time.  
  
### SQL Application  
 The **sqlApplicationManager** element of the MsDrdaService.exe.config file contains the application settings for managing out-bound SQL client connections. The sqlApplicationManager type is the Microsoft.HostIntegration.Drda.Server.SqlApplicationManager, which processes the out-bound SQL client connections.  
  
#### Rollback Transaction on Error  
 The **rollbackTransactionOnError** attribute instructs the DRDA Service to execute a ROLLBACK following a negative SQL Server database error. This **optional** attribute accepts a **Boolean** value. The default value is **true**.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Setting this value to false may provide compatibility with custom programs attached to DB2 for z/OS. However, setting this value to false may break compatibility with standard open platform (e.g. ODBC) DRDA application requester clients, such as IBM DB2 Connect JDBC Driver.  
  
### Security  
 The DRDA Service processes authentication of in-bound TCP/IP network connections. The DRDA Service supports optional encryption and single sign-on features to improve security and performance. The **securityManager** element of the MsDrdaService.exe.config file contains the security settings for managing in-bound DRDA client connections. The securityManager type is the Microsoft.HostIntegration.Drda.Server.SecurityManager, which processes authentication of in-bound TCP/IP network connections.  
  
#### ESSO Host-Initiated Affiliate Application  
 The **hostInitiatedAffiliateApplication** attribute defines the Affiliate Application name that the DRDA Service should use with Microsoft Enterprise Single Sign-On to map the in-bound DRDA AR client credentials to a Windows Active Directory domain user, when the SQL Client uses Windows Authentication. This **optional** property accepts a **string** value. The default value is an **empty string**, which instructs the DRDA Service to not use host-initiated ESSO.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  When using host-initiated ESSO, you must specify Integrated Security=true in the SQL Server connection string.  
  
 Affiliate applications are logical entities that represent a system or sub-system such as a host, back-end system, or IBM DB2 database client. Contact your SSO administrator for the SSO Affiliate Application name.
  
#### ESSO Windows-Initiated Affiliate Application  
 The **windowsInitiatedAffiliateApplication** attribute defines the Affiliate Application name that the DRDA Service should use with Microsoft Enterprise Single Sign-On to map the Windows Active Directory domain user to an out-bound SQL Client credentials, when the SQL Client uses SQL Server Authentication. This **optional** property accepts a **string** value. The default value is an **empty string**, which instructs the DRDA Service to not use Windows-initiated ESSO.  
  
 Optionally, specify a value of **isRdbName** to instruct the DRDA Service to use the in-bound RDBNAM (Relational Database Name) on the ACCRDB (Access Relational Database) protocol flow as the Windows-Initiated Affiliate Application name. When defining the Windows-initiated ESSO Affiliate Application, you must create a third field (“ConnectionString”). The credential mapping must contain in the ConnectionString field the argument value pair (Initial Catalog=<SQL_Server_Database_Name>). The credential mapping may contain a placeholder for the Password field (MS$SAME).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  When using Windows-initiated ESSO, you must specify Integrated Security=true in the SQL Server connection string.  
  
 Affiliate applications are logical entities that represent a system or sub-system such as a host, back-end system, or IBM DB2 database client. Contact your SSO administrator for the SSO Affiliate Application name.  
  
#### Security Token Timeout  
 The DRDA Service will cache the security token obtained from Microsoft Enterprise Single Sign-On and Mapped Authentication Domain features for a configured duration of time, with which to use when connecting to SQL Server configured for Windows authentication using integrated Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI).  
  
 The **securityTokenTimeout** attribute instructs the DRDA Server to retain a security token for a duration of time, after which to obtain a new Windows Client Identifier (CID).

This **optional** attribute accepts a **string** value. The default value is an **empty string**.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The Mapped Authentication Domain security authentication requires the following additional configuration.  
  
##### SQL Server Database Connection  
 The Integrated Security argument in the SQL Server connection string must be set to a value of **true**.  
  
 The **hostInitiatedAffiliateApplication** attribute within the **database** element of the MsDrdaService.exe.config file must be set to a value of **empty string**. You cannot utilize host-initiated ESSO concurrently with Mapped Authentication Domain security authentication.  
  
##### Windows Security for the DRDA Service Account  
 The MsDrdaService.exe must run in the context of a domain user account (Domain\User).  
  
 The service account must be a member of the HIS Administrators and HIS Runtime Users Local Groups.  
  
##### Local Security Policy  
 The service account requires these Local Security Policy settings to run as a service:  
  
-   The service account requires Log on as a service.  
  
-   The service account requires Act as part of the operating system.  
  
-   The service account requires Access Credential Manager as a trusted caller.
