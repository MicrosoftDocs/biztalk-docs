# TI Component Properties
In the Visual Studio environment, Transaction Integrator (TI) component properties appear and are edited in the **Properties** pane. When you select an entity in the Visual Studio tree view or list view, its properties appear in categories in the **Properties** pane. When you select multiple items, the intersection of their properties appear to allow for bulk edit.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The properties of the TI components are not intended to be set or changed programmatically. Setting or changing the properties programmatically may cause the component to function incorrectly.
