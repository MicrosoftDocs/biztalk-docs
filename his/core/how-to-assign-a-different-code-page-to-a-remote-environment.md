# How to Assign a Different Code Page to a Remote Environment
Use a remote environment (RE) to describe each CICS or IMS mainframe environment. Use Transaction Integrator (TI) Manager to create, modify, and delete REs.  
  
 Every RE description includes a property value for the code page that is to be used by the TI run-time environment to convert characters to and from mainframe data representations.  
  
 When you create a new RE, TI Manager automatically selects a code page based on the current system locale. However, you can replace this default value with a code page that you select.  
  
 As needed, you can use TI Manager to assign a different code page to any RE.  
  
### To select a different code page for an RE  
  
1.  On the **Start** menu, point to **Programs**, then **Microsoft Host Integration Server**, and then click **TI Manager**.  
  
2.  Expand the **Remote Environments** node.  
  
3.  Right-click the remote environment to be modified, and then click **Properties**.  
  
4.  On the **Locale** tab, clear the check box **Use default code page for the selected locale**.  
  
5.  On the **Locale** tab, select the new code page from the **Code page** dropdown list.  
  
 Only the code page value is significant to the TI run-time environment when it converts character data. Although you can use the locale displayed on the **Locale** property page to select the code page, the TI run-time environment ignores it and uses only the code page value that is associated with that locale.
