# FM Profile 2
Function management (FM) Profile 2 is supported on primary logic unit-secondary logic unit (PLU-SLU) sessions using LU 0. This profile uses the following session rules:  
  
-   SLU uses delayed request mode.  
  
-   SLU uses immediate response mode.  
  
-   Only single-RU chains are allowed.  
  
-   SLU requests indicate no-response.  
  
-   No FMH-1 SCB compression.  
  
-   Length-checked compression allowed.  
  
-   No data flow control (DFC) RUs.  
  
-   No FM headers.  
  
-   SLU is the first speaker if brackets are used.  
  
-   Bracket termination rule 2 is used if brackets are used.  
  
-   PLU will send an end bracket (EB).  
  
-   SLU will not send an EB.  
  
-   Normal-flow send/receive mode is full duplex (FDX).  
  
-   PLU is responsible for recovery.  
  
 The following FM Usage fields define the options for Profile 2:  
  
-   Primary request control mode selection  
  
-   Primary chain response protocol (no-response cannot be used)  
  
-   Brackets usage and reset state  
  
-   Alternate code
