# Making and Testing a Connection
This section provides the procedures used to make successful connections. Several steps are required to connect your host system to [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 One way to remember the four steps required to make a successful connection is with the acronym **LCLUA** that stands for **L**-Link Service, **C**-Connection, **LU**-LUs and **A**-Adding and Assigning Users.  
  
 For information on the new IP-DLC Link Service, see [IP-DLC Link Service](../core/ip-dlc-link-service1.md).  
  
 For information about configuring [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] for your enterprise environment, see [Configuring Your Enterprise](../core/configuring-your-enterprise1.md).
