# Transaction Integrator Performance Guide
To ensure excellent performance out of the box, Microsoft has run performance tests on Transaction Integrator (TI) to determine its performance and scalability in various deployment situations. This section discusses what was learned about TI.  
  
 Many factors can affect performance:  
  
- Security.  
  
- Whether you are using two-phase commit.  
  
- Sharing the server with other Microsoft BackOffice applications.  
  
- Sizing the server initially.  
  
- Planning for future growth.  
  
  This section will help you handle various load conditions and help you tune your system to give the best possible TI performance while avoiding performance pitfalls, especially with transactions that run for a long time.
