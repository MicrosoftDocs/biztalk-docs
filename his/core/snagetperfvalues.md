# SNAGetPerfValues
The **SNAGetPerfValues** function is used to provide pointers to the *ServiceNameIndex* and *FirstCounterIndex* variables so that the Perfmon application knows where to get the descriptions of the performance counters from the registry. These variables are returned as members in the **ADAPTERPERFDATA** structure returned by the **SNAGetLinkPerfArea** function.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
            USHORT SNAGetPerfValues(  
            int *pServiceNameIndex,int *pFirstCounterIndexÂ   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *pServiceNameIndex*  
 A pointer to the **ServiceNameIndex** member of the **ADAPTERPERFDATA** structure.  
  
 *pFirstCounterIndex*  
 A pointer to the **FirstCounterIndex** member of the **ADAPTERPERFDATA** structure.
