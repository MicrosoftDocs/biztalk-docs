# Selecting Components to Trace
Before you can begin tracing files, you need to decide on the Host Integration Server components to trace.  
  
 The Trace application enables you to record internal or external activity for the following components:  
  
-   Enterprise Single Sign-On  
  
-   NVAlert  
  
-   SNA applications  
  
-   SNA Manager Client  
  
-   SNA Manager Agent (MngAgent)  
  
-   SnaBase  
  
-   Installed link services  
  
-   SNANetMn  
  
-   SNAPrint  
  
-   SNAServer  
  
-   SNA Management  
  
-   DB2 Network Library  
  
-   SNADDM  
  
-   TN3270  
  
-   TN5250
