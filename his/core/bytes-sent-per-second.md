# Bytes Sent Per Second
The bytes sent per second performance counter reports the total data flow in bytes from the Transaction Integrator (TI) server to the host per second. This becomes a useful counter when TI transactions become large, and communication links can become the bottleneck in the system. This is particularly important when WANs are used.
