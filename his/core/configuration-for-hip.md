# Configuration for HIP
The TI Configuration Tool provides assistance in creating the HIPService.exe.config file that gives the HIP runtime engine the information necessary to read incoming data, process the data via a custom written component, and send back response data.  When run as an admin, the tool will also install the configured HIP Services and can be used to start and stop the HIP Services.  The TI Runtime uses the HIPService.exe.config file that resides in the %snaroot% directory.

> [!NOTE]
It is recommended to run the TI Configuration Tool as a user that has read/write access to the file locations where the config files are located. When using HIP, the user should also have rights to start and stop Windows services.
