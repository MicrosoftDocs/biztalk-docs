# Configure Local Environment Endpoints (TCP/IP) Wizard Page
Use the **Configure Local Environment Endpoints** (TCP/IP)wizard page to define the endpoints used to communicate with the host. To define the TCP/IP ports or service names for the local environment, type a port number or name, and then click **Add**.

The port number or name cannot be the same as that of an existing number or name in the **Defined ports and service names**.|
