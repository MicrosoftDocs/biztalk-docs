# Setup Information (SNADIS)
This section describes the integrated link service installation provided with Host Integration Server.  
  
 In Host Integration Server, SNA Manager is used to install and configure link services. Host Integration Server uses the Microsoft System Installer (MSI) and MSI packages for the installation of the Host Integration Server. Link services from independent hardware vendors (IHVs) are not included in the main Host Integration Server MSI packages. IHV link services are installed using a separate IHV-provided MSI package.  
  
 A sample IHV link service using the generic Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) link service that illustrates IHV link service installation is included in the Host Integration Server software development kit (SDK). The SDK samples are installed on your computer when the SDK option is selected during installation of Host Integration Server. Host Integration Server does not support the earlier .inf-based link service setup procedure.
