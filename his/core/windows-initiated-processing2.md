# Windows-Initiated Processing
Windows-initiated processing (WIP) enables Windows-based client applications to invoke mainframe based transaction programs (TPs). Transaction Integrator (TI) along with the Windows operating system includes everything you need to build, deploy, and manage TI components that enable mainframe transaction programs (TPs) to interoperate with Windows-based COM and .NET applications.  
  
 The following programming models support Windows-initiated processing:  
  
-   [TCP Transaction Request Message Link](../core/tcp-transaction-request-message-link2.md)  
  
-   [TCP Enhanced Listener Message Link](../core/tcp-enhanced-listener-message-link1.md)  
  
-   [TCP Transaction Request Message User Data](../core/tcp-transaction-request-message-user-data2.md)  
  
-   [TCP Enhanced Listener Message User Data](../core/tcp-enhanced-listener-message-user-data2.md)  
  
-   [IMS Connect](../core/ims-connect1.md)  
  
-   [OS/400 Distributed Program Calls](../core/os-400-distributed-program-calls1.md)  
  
-   [CICS LU6.2 User Data](../core/cics-lu6-2-user-data2.md)  
  
-   [CICS LU6.2 Link](../core/cics-lu6-2-link1.md)
