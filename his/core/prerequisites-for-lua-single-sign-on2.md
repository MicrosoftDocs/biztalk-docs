# Prerequisites for LUA Single Sign-On
In preparation for using Single Sign-On over 3270 logical unit for application (LUA LUs), the system administrator must define an Enterprise Single Sign-On Affiliate Application. This host security domain must be initially created or modified to enable the Single Sign-On feature. The system administrator must enable a userâ€™s Windows account in the ESSO database and either the administrator or the user must establish a mapped host account for the Windows domain user name.  
  
 The user must be logged on to a Windows domain with a user name and password. Note that this Single Sign-On feature is only supported over LUA LUs.
