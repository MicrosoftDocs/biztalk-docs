# Prerequisites for 3270 Single Sign-On
In preparation for using 3270 Single Sign-On, the system administrator must define an Enterprise Single Sign-On (ESSO). The system administrator must enable a user's Windows account in the ESSO database and either the administrator or the user must establish a mapped host account for the Windows domain user name.  
  
 The user must be logged on to a Windows domain with a user name and password. Note that this Single Sign-On feature is only supported over 3270 LUs.
