# SLI_RECEIVE
The **SLI_RECEIVE** verb receives responses, SNA commands, and data into a Microsoft® Windows® logical unit application (LUA) applications buffer. **SLI_RECEIVE** also provides the current status of the session to the Windows LUA application.  
  
 The following structure describes the LUA_COMMON member of the verb control block (VCB) used by SLI_RECEIVE.  
  
## Syntax

 Supplied parameter. Contains the verb code, LUA_VERB_SLI for Session Level Interface (SLI) verbs.  
  
 **lua_verb_length**  
 Supplied parameter. Specifies the length in bytes of the LUA VCB. It must contain the length of the verb record being issued.  
  
 **lua_prim_rc**  
 Primary return code set by LUA at the completion of the verb. The valid return codes vary depending on the LUA verb issued.  
  
 **lua_sec_rc**  
 Secondary return code set by LUA at the completion of the verb. The valid return codes vary depending on the LUA verb issued.

 Supplied parameter. Contains the LUA command code (verb operation code) for the verb to be issued, LUA_OPCODE_SLI_RECEIVE.  
  
 **lua_correlator**  
 Supplied parameter. Contains a user-supplied value that links the verb with other user-supplied information. LUA does not use or change this information. This parameter is optional.  
  
 **lua_luname**  
 Supplied parameter. Specifies the ASCII name of the local LU used by the Windows LUA session.  
  
 SLI_RECEIVE only requires this parameter if lua_sid is zero.  
  
 This parameter is eight bytes long, padded on the right with spaces (0x20) if the name is shorter than eight characters.

 LUA_INVALID_FLOW  
  
 Secondary return code; the **lua_flag1** flow flags were set incorrectly when a verb was issued:  
  
-   When issuing [SLI_SEND](../core/sli-send.md) to send an SNA response, set only one **lua_flag1** flow flag.  
  
-   When issuing SLI_RECEIVE, set at least one lua_flag1 flow flag.

 LUA_UNSUCCESSFUL  
 Primary return code; the verb record supplied was valid but the verb did not complete successfully.  
  
 LUA_DATA_TRUNCATED  
  
 Secondary return code; the data was truncated because the data received was longer than the buffer length specified in **lua_max_length**.  
  
 LUA_DATA_SEGMENT_LENGTH_ERROR  
  
 Secondary return code; one of the following has occurred:  
  
-   The supplied data segment for **SLI_RECEIVE** or [SLI_SEND](../core/sli-send.md) is not a read/write data segment as required.

 LUA_NOT_READY  
  
 Secondary return code; one of the following has caused the SLI session to be temporarily suspended:  
  
-   An SNA UNBIND type 0x02 command was received, which indicates a new BIND is coming. If the UNBIND type 0x02 is received after the beginning [SLI_OPEN](../core/sli-open.md) is complete, the session is suspended until a BIND, optional CRV and STSN, and SDT flows are received. These routines are re-entrant because they have to be called again. The session resumes after the SLI processes the SDT command. If the UNBIND type 0x02 is received while the **SLI_OPEN** is still processing, the primary return code is LUA_SESSION_FAILURE, not LUA_STATUS.  
  
-   The receipt of an SNA CLEAR caused the suspension. Receipt of an SNA SDT will cause the session to resume.  
  
 LUA_SLI_LOGIC_ERROR  
  
 Secondary return code; the LUA interface found an internal error in logic.  
  
 LUA_INVALID_PROCESS  
  
 Secondary return code; the session for which an LUA verb was issued is unavailable because another OS/2 process owns the session.  
  
 LUA_LU_INOPERATIVE  
  
 Secondary return code; a severe error occurred while the LUA was attempting to stop the session. This LU is unavailable for any LUA requests until an activate logical unit (ACTLU) is received from the host.  
  
 LUA_RECEIVE_CORRELATION_TABLE_FULL  
  
 Secondary return code; the session receive correlation table for the flow requested reached its capacity.  
  
 LUA_NEGATIVE_RESPONSE  
 Primary return code; either the LUA sent a negative response to a message received from the primary logical unit (PLU) because an error was found in the message, or the application responded negatively to a chain for which the end-of-chain has arrived.  
  
 LUA_MODE_INCONSISTENCY  
  
 Secondary return code; performing this function is not allowed by the current status. The request sent to the half-session component was not executed even though it was understood and supported. This SNA sense code is also an exception request sense code.  
  
 LUA_FUNCTION_NOT_SUPPORTED  
  
 Secondary return code; the LUA does not support the requested function. A control character, an RU parameter, or a formatted request code may have specified the function. Specific sense code information is in bytes 2 and 3.  
  
 LUA_DATA_TRAFFIC_RESET  
  
 Secondary return code; a half-session of an active session but with inactive data traffic received a normal flow DFC or FMD request. An invalid request header or request unit for the receivers current session control or data flow control state was found. Delivery to the half-session component was prevented.  
  
 LUA_DATA_TRAFFIC_NOT_RESET  
  
 Secondary return code; while the data traffic state was not reset, the session control request was received. An invalid request header or request unit for the received current session control or data flow control state was found. Delivery to the half-session component was prevented.  
  
 LUA_SC_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION  
  
 Secondary return code; a violation of SC protocol occurred. A request (that is permitted only after an SC request and a positive response to that request have been successfully exchanged) was received before the required exchange. Byte 4 of the sense data contains the request code. No user data exists for this sense code. An invalid header request or request unit for the received current session control or data flow control state was found. Delivery to the half-session component was prevented.  
  
 LUA_INVALID_SC_OR_NC_RH  
  
 Secondary return code; the RH of an SC or NC request was invalid.  
  
 LUA_PACING_NOT_SUPPORTED  
  
 Secondary return code; the request contained a pacing indicator when support of pacing for this session does not exist for the receiving half-session or boundary function half-session. The BIND options chosen previously or the architectural rules were violated by the request header parameter values. Delivery to the half-session component was prevented. The errors are not dependent on the current session state. The senders failure to enforce session rules may have caused the errors.  
  
 LUA_NAU_INOPERATIVE  
  
 Secondary return code; the network addressable unit is not able to process responses or requests. Delivery to the receiver could not take place for one of the following reasons:  
  
-   A path information unit error  
  
-   A path outage  
  
-   An invalid sequence of requests for activation  
  
 If a path error is received during an active session, it usually means there is no longer a valid path to the session partner.  
  
 LUA_CANCELED  
 Primary return code; the secondary return code gives the reason for canceling the command.  
  
 LUA_PURGED  
  
 Secondary return code; [SLI_PURGE](../core/sli-purge.md) was issued and canceled **SLI_RECEIVE**.  
  
 LUA_NO_SLI_SESSION  
  
 Secondary return code; a session was not open or was down due to an [SLI_CLOSE](../core/sli-close.md) or session failure when a command was issued.  
  
 LUA_CANCEL_COMMAND_RECEIVED  
  
 Secondary return code; the host sent an SNA CANCEL command to cancel the data chain currently being received by **SLI_RECEIVE**.  
  
 LUA_TERMINATED  
  
 Secondary return code; the session was terminated when a verb was pending. The verb process has been canceled.  
  
 LUA_IN_PROGRESS  
 Primary return code; an asynchronous command was received but is not completed.  
  
 LUA_STATUS  
 Primary return code; the secondary return code contains SLI status information for the application.  
  
 LUA_READY  
  
 Secondary return code; following a NOT READY status, this status is issued to notify you that the SLI is ready to process commands.  
  
 LUA_NOT_READY  
  
 Secondary return code; the SLI session is temporarily suspended for the following reason:  
  
-   An SNA UNBIND type 0x02 command was received, which means a new BIND is coming. If the UNBIND type 0x02 is received after the beginning [SLI_OPEN](../core/sli-open.md) is complete, the session is suspended until a BIND, optional CRV and STSN, and SDT flows are received. These routines are re-entrant because they have to be called again. The session resumes after the SLI processes the SDT command. If the UNBIND type 0x02 is received while the **SLI_OPEN** is still processing, the primary return code is session-failure, not status.  
  
-   The receipt of an SNA CLEAR caused the suspension. Receipt of an SNA SDT will cause the session to resume.  
  
 LUA_INIT_COMPLETE  
  
 Secondary return code; the LUA interface initialized the session while [SLI_OPEN](../core/sli-open.md) was processing. LUA applications that issue **SLI_OPEN** with **lua_open_type_prim_sscp** receive this status on **SLI_RECEIVE** or [SLI_BID](../core/sli-bid.md).  
  
 LUA_SESSION_END_REQUESTED  
  
 Secondary return code; the LUA interface received an SNA SHUTD from the host, which means the host is ready to shut down the session.  
  
 LUA_COMM_SUBSYSTEM_ABENDED  
 Primary return code; indicates one of the following conditions:  
  
-   The node used by this conversation encountered an ABEND.  
  
-   The connection between the transaction program (TP) and the physical unit (PU) 2.1 node has been broken (a LAN error).  
  
-   The SnaBase at the TPs computer encountered an ABEND.  
  
 LUA_COMM_SUBSYSTEM_NOT_LOADED  
 Primary return code; a required component could not be loaded or terminated while processing the verb. Thus, communication could not take place. Contact the system administrator for corrective action.  
  
 LUA_INVALID_VERB_SEGMENT  
 Primary return code; the VCB extended beyond the end of the data segment.  
  
 LUA_UNEXPECTED_DOS_ERROR  
 Primary return code; after issuing an operating system call, an unexpected operating system return code was received and is specified in the secondary return code.  
  
 LUA_STACK_TOO_SMALL  
 Primary return code; the stack size of the application is too small to execute the verb. Increase the stack size of your application.  
  
 LUA_INVALID_VERB  
 Primary return code; either the verb code or the operation code, or both, is invalid. The verb did not execute.  
  
## Remarks  
 **SLI_RECEIVE** receives responses, SNA commands, and request unit data from the host. **SLI_RECEIVE** also provides the status of the session to the Windows LUA application. An [SLI_OPEN](../core/sli-open.md) request must complete before **SLI_RECEIVE** can be issued. However, if **SLI_OPEN** is issued with **lua_init_type** set to LUA_INIT_TYPE_PRIM_SSCP, an **SLI_RECEIVE** over the SSCP normal flow can be issued as soon as **SLI_OPEN** returns an IN_PROGRESS.  
  
 Data is received by the application in one of four session flows. The four session flows, from highest to lowest priority are:  
  
-   SSCP expedited  
  
-   LU expedited  
  
-   SSCP normal  
  
-   LU normal  
  
 The data flow type that **SLI_RECEIVE** will process is specified in **lua_flag1**. The application can also specify whether it wants to look at more than one type of data flow. When multiple flow bits are set, the highest priority is received first. When **SLI_RECEIVE** completes processing, **lua_flag2** indicates the specific type of flow for which data has been received by the Windows LUA application.  
  
 If [SLI_BID](../core/sli-bid.md) successfully completes before SLI_RECEIVE is issued, the Windows LUA interface can be instructed to reuse the last SLI_BID verbs VCB. To do this, issue SLI_RECEIVE with lua_flag1.bid_enable set to 1.  
  
 When using lua_flag1.bid_enable, the SLI_BID storage must not be freed because the last SLI_BID verbs VCB is used. Also, when using lua_flag1.bid_enable, the successful completion of SLI_BID will be posted.  
  
 If SLI_RECEIVE is issued with lua_flag1.nowait when no data is available to receive, LUA_NO_DATA will be the secondary return code set by the Windows LUA interface.  
  
## Session Status Return Values  
 If LUA_STATUS is the primary return code, the secondary return code can be one of the following:  
  
 LUA_READY  
  
 LUA_NOT_READY  
  
 LUA_SESSION_END_REQUESTED  
  
 LUA_INIT_COMPLETE  
  
 In addition, if LUA_STATUS is the primary return code, the following parameters are used:  
  
 **lua_sec_rc**  
  
 lua_sid  
  
 LUA_READY is returned after an LUA_NOT_READY status and indicates that the SLI is again ready to perform all commands.  
  
 LUA_NOT_READY indicates that the SLI session is suspended because the SLI has received either an SNA CLEAR command or an SNA UNBIND command with an 0x02 UNBIND type (UNBIND with BIND forthcoming). Depending on what caused the suspension, the session can be reactivated as follows:  
  
-   When the suspension is caused by an SNA CLEAR, receiving an SNA SDT reactivates the session.  
  
-   When an SNA UNBIND type BIND forthcoming causes suspension of the session and the [SLI_OPEN](../core/sli-open.md) that opened the session is completed, the session is suspended until the SLI receives a BIND and SDT command. The session can also optionally receive an STSN command. As a result, user-supplied routines issued with the initial SLI_OPEN must be re-entered because they will be recalled.  
  
 The application can send SSCP data after a CLEAR or UNBIND type BIND forthcoming arrives and before the NOT_READY status is read. The application can send and receive SSCP data after reading a NOT_READY.  
  
 When an SNA UNBIND type BIND forthcoming arrives before completion of the SLI_OPEN that opened the session, LUA_SESSION_FAILURE (not LUA_STATUS) is the primary return code.  
  
 LUA_SESSION_END_REQUESTED indicates that the application received an SNA SHUTD from the host. The Windows LUA application should issue [SLI_CLOSE](../core/sli-close.md) to close the session when convenient.  
  
 LUA_INIT_COMPLETE is returned only when lua_init_type for [SLI_OPEN](../core/sli-open.md) is LUA_INIT_TYPE_PRIM_SSCP. The status means that the SLI_OPEN has been processed sufficiently to allow SSCP data to now be sent or received.  
  
## Exception Requests  
 If a host application request unit is converted into an EXR, sense data will be returned. When [SLI_BID](../core/sli-bid.md) completes with the returned verb parameters set as shown, an EXR conversion occurs.  
  
|Member|Set to|  
|------------|------------|  
|**lua_prim_rc**|OK (0x0000)|  
|**lua_sec_rc**|OK (0x00000000)|  
|**lua_rh.rri**|bit off (request unit)|  
|**lua_rh.sdi**|bit on (includes sense data)|  
  
 Of the seven bytes of data in **lua_peek_data**, bytes 0 through 3 define the error detected. The following table indicates possible sense data and the values of bytes 0 through 3.  
  
|Sense data|Value of bytes 0–3|  
|----------------|------------------------|  
|LUA_MODE_INCONSISTENCY|0x08090000|  
|LUA_BRACKET_RACE_ERROR|0x080B0000|  
|LUA_BB_REJECT_NO_RTR|0x08130000|  
|LUA_RECEIVER_IN_TRANSMIT_MODE|0x081B0000|  
|LUA_CRYPTOGRAPHY_FUNCTION_INOP|0x08480000|  
|LUA_SYNC_EVENT_RESPONSE|0x10010000|  
|LUA_RU_DATA_ERROR|0x10020000|  
|LUA_RU_LENGTH_ERROR|0x10020000|  
|LUA_INCORRECT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER|0x20010000|  
  
 The information returned to bytes 3 through 6 in **lua_peek_data** is determined by the first three bytes of the initial request unit that caused the error.
