# What WIP Does
Windows-initiated processing (WIP) enables Windows-based client applications to invoke mainframe based transaction programs (TPs). Transaction Integrator (TI) provides a COM or .NET object interface (an Automation interface), maps data types to convert from the Intel-based architecture to the OS/390-based or OS/400-based architecture, and interacts with the host TPs.
