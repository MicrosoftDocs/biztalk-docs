# Securing the TN3270 and TN5250 Services
You can help secure TN3270 and TN5250 services by specifying client workstation IP addresses that have permission to use the resources provided. With TN3270E clients, you can specify a workstation name in place of the client IP address.  
  
 The method employed for verifying workstations can also be used to allow only specified IPs to request resources allocated to them.
