# RUI_BID
The **RUI_BID** verb notifies the Request Unit Interface (RUI) application that a message is waiting to be read using [RUI_READ](../core/rui-read.md).  
  
 The following structure describes the **LUA_COMMON** member of the verb control block (VCB) used by **RUI_BID**:  
  
 The second syntax union describes the **LUA_SPECIFIC** member of the verb control block (VCB) used by **RUI_BID**. Other union members are omitted for clarity:

```  
  
## Members  
 *lua_verb*  
 Supplied parameter. Contains the verb code, LUA_VERB_RUI for RUI verbs.  
  
 *lua_verb_length*  
 Supplied parameter. Specifies the length in bytes of the logical unit application (LUA) VCB. It must contain the length of the verb record being issued.  
  
 *lua_prim_rc*  
 Primary return code set by LUA at the completion of the verb. The valid return codes vary depending on the LUA verb issued.  
  
 *lua_sec_rc*  
 Secondary return code set by LUA at the completion of the verb. The valid return codes vary depending on the LUA verb issued.  
  
 *lua_opcode*  
 Supplied parameter. Contains the LUA command code (verb operation code) for the verb to be issued, LUA_OPCODE_RUI_BID.  
  
 *lua_correlator*  
 Supplied parameter. Contains a user-supplied value that links the verb with other user-supplied information. LUA does not use or change this information. This parameter is optional.  
  
 *lua_luname*  
 Supplied parameter. Specifies the ASCII name of the local LU used by the Windows LUA session.  
  
 **RUI_BID** only requires this parameter if **lua_sid** is zero.  
  
 This parameter is eight bytes long, padded on the right with spaces (0x20) if the name is shorter than eight characters.

## Return Codes  
 LUA_OK  
 Primary return code; the verb executed successfully.  
  
 LUA_CANCELED  
 Primary return code; the verb did not complete successfully because it was canceled by another verb.  
  
 LUA_TERMINATED  
  
 Secondary return code; [RUI_TERM](../core/rui-term.md) was issued while this verb was pending.  
  
 LUA_PARAMETER_CHECK  
 Primary return code; the verb did not execute because of a parameter error.  
  
 LUA_BAD_SESSION_ID  
  
 Secondary return code; an invalid value for **lua_sid** was specified in the VCB.  
  
 LUA_BID_ALREADY_ENABLED  
  
 Secondary return code; **RUI_BID** was rejected because a previous **RUI_BID** was already outstanding. Only one **RUI_BID** can be outstanding at any one time.  
  
 LUA_INVALID_POST_HANDLE  
  
 Secondary return code; for a Windows operating system using events as the asynchronous posting method, the Windows LUA VCB does not contain a valid event handle.  
  
 LUA_RESERVED_FIELD_NOT_ZERO  
  
 Secondary return code; a reserved field in the verb record, or a parameter not used by this verb, was set to a nonzero value.  
  
 LUA_VERB_LENGTH_INVALID  
  
 Secondary return code; an LUA verb was issued with the value of **lua_verb_length** unexpected by LUA.  
  
 LUA_STATE_CHECK  
 Primary return code; the verb did not execute because it was issued in an invalid state.  
  
 LUA_NO_RUI_SESSION  
  
 Secondary return code; [RUI_INIT](../core/rui-init.md) has not yet completed successfully for the LU name specified on this verb.  
  
 LUA_UNSUCCESSFUL  
 Primary return code; the verb record supplied was valid, but the verb did not complete successfully.  
  
 LUA_INVALID_PROCESS  
  
 Secondary return code; the process that issued this verb was not the same process that issued **RUI_INIT** for this session. Only the process that started a session can issue verbs on that session.  
  
 LUA_NEGATIVE_RSP  
 Primary return code; LUA detected an error in the data received from the host. Instead of passing the received message to the application on [RUI_READ](../core/rui-read.md), LUA discards the message (and the rest of the chain if it is in a chain), and sends a negative response to the host.  
  
 LUA informs the application on a subsequent **RUI_READ** or **RUI_BID** that a negative response was sent.  
  
 The secondary return code contains the sense code sent to the host on the negative response. For information about interpreting the sense code values that can be returned, see [SNA Considerations Using LUA](../Topic/SNA%20Considerations%20with%20LUA2.md).  
  
 A zero secondary return code indicates that, following a previous [RUI_WRITE](../core/rui-write.md) of a negative response to a message in the middle of a chain, LUA has now received and discarded all messages from this chain.  
  
 LUA_COMM_SUBSYSTEM_ABENDED  
 Primary return code; indicates one of the following conditions:  
  
-   The node used by this conversation encountered an ABEND.  
  
-   The connection between the transaction program (TP) and the physical unit (PU) 2.1 node has been broken (a LAN error).  
  
-   The SnaBase at the TPs computer encountered an ABEND.  
  
 LUA_SESSION_FAILURE  
 Primary return code; a required Host Integration Server component has terminated.  
  
 LUA_LU_COMPONENT_DISCONNECTED  
  
 Secondary return code; indicates that the LUA session has failed because of a problem with the link service or with the host LU.  
  
 LUA_RUI_LOGIC_ERROR  
  
 Secondary return code; an internal error was detected within LUA. This error should not occur during normal operation.  
  
 LUA_INVALID_VERB  
 Primary return code; either the verb code or the operation code, or both, is invalid. The verb did not execute.  
  
 LUA_STACK_TOO_SMALL  
 Primary return code; the stack size of the application is too small to execute the verb. Increase the stack size of your application.  
  
 LUA_COMM_SUBSYSTEM_NOT_LOADED  
 Primary return code; a required component could not be loaded or has terminated while processing the verb. Thus, communication could not take place. Contact the system administrator for corrective action.  
  
 LUA_UNEXPECTED_DOS_ERROR  
 Primary return code; after issuing an operating system call, an unexpected operating system return code was received and is specified in the secondary return code.  
  
## Remarks  
 **RUI_BID** is used by applications that require notification that a message is waiting to be read. This allows the application to determine how it will handle the message before issuing [RUI_READ](../core/rui-read.md).  
  
 When a message is available, **RUI_BID** returns with details of the message flow on which it was received, the message type, the TH and RH of the message, and up to 12 bytes of message data.  
  
 The main difference between **RUI_BID** and **RUI_READ** is that **RUI_BID** allows the application to check the data without removing it from the incoming message queue, so it can be left and accessed later. **RUI_READ** removes the message from the queue, so when the application reads the data it must also process it.  
  
 Note the following when using **RUI_BID**:  
  
-   [RUI_INIT](../core/rui-init.md) must complete successfully before this verb is issued.  
  
-   Only one **RUI_BID** can be outstanding at any one time.  
  
-   After **RUI_BID** has completed successfully, it can be reissued by setting **lua_flag1.bid_enable** on a subsequent [RUI_READ](../core/rui-read.md). If the verb is reissued in this way, the application must not free or modify the storage associated with the **RUI_BID** record.  
  
-   If a message arrives from the host when **RUI_READ** and **RUI_BID** are both outstanding, **RUI_READ** completes and **RUI_BID** is left in progress.  
  
 Each message that arrives is bid only once. After **RUI_BID** indicates that data is waiting on a particular session flow, the application issues **RUI_READ** to receive the data. Any subsequent **RUI_BID** does not report data arriving on that session flow until the message that was bid has been accepted by issuing **RUI_READ**.  
  
 In general, the **lua_data_length** parameter returned on this verb indicates only the length of data in **lua_peek_data**, not the total length of data on the waiting message (except when a value of less than 12 is returned). The application should ensure that the data length on **RUI_READ** that accepts the data is sufficient to contain the message.
