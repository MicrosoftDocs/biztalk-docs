# Protect the Remoting Session
To prevent an attacker from tampering with the remote session or denying service, you should do the following:  
  
-   Use HTTPS between the remoting client and the server  
  
-   Use separate ASP.NET application contexts for various levels of privileged users, thereby preventing lower-privileged users from affecting sessions belonging to higher-privileged users.  
  
 You can also help mitigate this threat with the following deployment scenario:  
  
-   ASP.NET Web client.  
  
 You can learn more about this threat by reading about the following:  
  
-   Multiple levels of authorized users  
  
-   ASP.NET application and IIS security  
  
-   Properly-formatted TRM, DPL, SNA, IP, and other messages  
  
-   Valid host user ID and password  
  
-   Valid Windows user ID for Single Sign-On (SSO).
