# BizTalk Pipeline Conversion Library Wizard
The Pipeline Component Designer allows you to add messages or record conversion to existing BizTalk adapters that do not offer built-in transformation or formatting, such as the adapters for WebSphere MQ and File Transfer Protocol (FTP). You can use it to produce BizTalk message pipeline-level solutions that scale and perform well.  
  
 The Visual Studio Designer plug-in supports COBOL, RPG, and XSD import/export. Host data conversion is based on existing HIS technologies. The host data conversion runtime engine converts numeric, datetime, and string data types for a range of platforms and locales.
