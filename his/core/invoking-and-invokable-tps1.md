# Invoking and Invokable TPs
There are two kinds of TPs: TPs that can invoke (that is, initiate a conversation with) other TPs, and TPs that can be invoked. A TP that can invoke another TP is called an invoking TP, and a TP that can be invoked is called an invokable TP.  
  
 The topics in this section describe the following:  
  
- How invoking TPs request invokable TPs.  
  
- How invokable TPs identify themselves to Host Integration Server in preparation for being invoked.  
  
- How an invokable TP is matched to an invoking TP's request.  
  
  For information about how to configure LUs to support TPs, see [Configuring TPs on Host Integration Server](../core/configuring-tps-on-host-integration-server1.md) and Host Integration Server Help.
