# Additional Help with Events and Errors
We provide troubleshooting information about specific product event and error messages. For Windows operating systems, you can access event message documentation by using the link inside the property window of an event. 
  
 The information provided on the Web site includes:  
  
-   The text of the event or error message, so you can confirm you have located the correct message  
  
-   A detailed explanation of what caused the event or error  
  
-   Recommended actions, if any, for you to take to correct the problem.  
  
 For Windows operating systems, you can also access additional information about an event by using the Event Viewer or additional information about an error directly from the Microsoft Web site.
