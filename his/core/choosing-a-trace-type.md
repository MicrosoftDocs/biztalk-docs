# Choosing a Trace Type
After selecting one or more [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../core/includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] components to be traced, decide the type of tracing to apply.  
  
 The following table describes the types of tracing available:  
  
|Type of tracing|Activity traced|Applies to installed components|  
|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------|  
|Internal*|Activity within a software component of [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../core/includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)].|SnaBase, SnaServer (PU 2.1 node), SNA applications, link services and more.|  
|Message|Messages passed into and out of a software component of [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../core/includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)], including messages sent to and received from the network.|SnaBase, SnaServer (PU 2.1 node), SNA applications, link services and more.|  
|API|Information passed into and out of a [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../core/includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] DLL, as the DLL communicates with an application, such as the APPC DLL.|SNA applications and more.|  
  
 \* Internal tracing is intended for use by product support technicians. Interpreting internal traces and certain types of message traces requires a specialized knowledge base.
