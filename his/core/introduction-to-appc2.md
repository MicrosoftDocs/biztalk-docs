# Introduction to APPC
This section introduces the fundamental concepts of Advanced Program-to-Program Communications (APPC) in a distributed processing environment. These concepts include the following:  

- APPC verbs  

- Microsoft® Windows® APPC extensions  

- Using APPC verbs in C programs  

- Operating system considerations  

  Detailed descriptions of APPC verbs are provided in:  

- [APPC Management Verbs](./appc-management-verbs1.md)  

- [APPC TP Verbs](./appc-tp-verbs2.md)  

- [APPC Conversation Verbs](./appc-conversation-verbs1.md)  

  APPC is an application programming interface (API) that enables peer-to-peer communications in a Systems Network Architecture (SNA) environment. Through APPC, programs distributed across a network can work together, communicating with each other and exchanging data, to accomplish a single processing task such as querying a remote database, copying a remote file, or sending and receiving electronic mail.
