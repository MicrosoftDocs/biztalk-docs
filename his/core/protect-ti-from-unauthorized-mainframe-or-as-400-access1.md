# Protect TI from Unauthorized Mainframe or AS/400 Access
To prevent an attacker from using the mainframe or AS/400 connection to access the server running Transaction Integrator, you should:  
  
-   Utilize direct network connections over private segment.  
  
-   Use IPsec, where supported, for IP communications between the host and Windows servers.  
  
-   For SNA LU6.2 network connections to mainframe or AS/400 computers, use Host Integration Server server-to-server data encryption when deploying upstream Host Integration Server computer as SNA gateway to downstream TI HIP computer.  
  
-   For SNA LU6.2 network connections to mainframe, use Host Integration Server IP-DLC Link Service in conjunction with IPsec.
