# TrnsDT Code Page Support
The TrnsDT API is used to perform all DBCS EBCDIC-to- ASCII conversions throughout Host Integration Server. To a degree, TrnsDT has been and continues to be a uniform translation method and cross-component resource. TrnsDT also handles mixed DBCS and SBCS, plus SBCS for Japan.
