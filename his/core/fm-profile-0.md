# FM Profile 0
Function management (FM) Profile 0 is supported on SSCP-PU and SSCP-SLU sessions. This profile specifies the following session rules:  
  
-   SSCP, PU, and SLU use immediate request mode and immediate response mode.  
  
-   Only single-RU chains are allowed.  
  
-   All chains require definite response.  
  
-   No compression.  
  
-   No data flow control (DFC) RUs.  
  
-   No function management (FM) headers.  
  
-   No brackets.  
  
-   No alternate code.  
  
-   Normal flow send/receive mode is half-duplex contention.  
  
-   Secondary wins contention.  
  
-   SSCP is responsible for recovery.
