# sbputerm
The **sbputerm** function must be called when the application terminates. It frees the DL-BASE and Dynamic Access Module (DMOD) resources used by the application.  
  
 For Win32Â®, do not call **sbputerm** from an entry point in a detached DLL process because it may cause a deadlock inside the SNADMOD.DLL.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
VOID sbputerm(  
void  
);      
```
