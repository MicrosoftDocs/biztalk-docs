# Four Most Common Problems
The four most common problems reported are as follows:  
  
1.  **Setup or Upgrades**: The most frequently asked [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../core/includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] questions are related to setup or upgrade issues. If you are connecting to an AS/400 via Token-Ring or Ethernet, make sure you read KB article Q112158 found at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=14394](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=14394). If you are connecting to an AS/400 via an SDLC card, KB Article Q112159 found at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=14395](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=14395) can be helpful. Examples of VTAM configurations for connecting to a mainframe can be found in the [Host Configuration](../core/host-configuration.md) section. The configuration file (COM.CFG) contains almost all of the configuration information for the Host Integration Server environment. It is extremely important to back up this file before making changes.  
  
2.  **Connectivity Issues**: If you are having a problem connecting to the host, determine where the problem originates. Because [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../core/includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] is the middle piece of a three-part connection, it helps to narrow the problem down to a Host Integration client, Host Integration Server issue, or a Host Integration Server host issue.  
  
3.  **Host Printing**: For more information, see [Host Print Service Problems](../core/host-print-service-problems.md).  
  
4.  **APPC or LUA Application Failures**: See [APPC or LUA Application Failures](../core/appc-or-lua-application-failures.md).
