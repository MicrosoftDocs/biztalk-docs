# Event Signaling
The device driver notifies the SNALink whenever an event occurs (such as a frame being received from the line) by setting an event.  
  
 The SNALink provides the driver with a handle to this event (or semaphore) at the start of day by issuing an IOCTL call of type **SET_EVENT_HANDLE**.
