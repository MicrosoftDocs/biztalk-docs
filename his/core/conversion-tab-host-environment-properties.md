# Conversion Tab (Host Environment Properties)
The **Conversion** tab defines the data type characteristics used by the host that makes requests to the Windows platform. The code page and elemental data conversion object are used by host-initiated processing (HIP) to transform the incoming and outgoing data to a form that can be used by the host application program.  
  
|Use this|To do this|  
|--------------|----------------|  
|**Data conversion**|Select the data conversion routine to be used.|  
|**Host code page**|Select the code page used by the host. Each available code page is listed by its symbolic value.|  
  
> [!CAUTION]
>  The properties of a host environment are not intended to be set or changed programmatically. Setting or changing the properties programmatically might cause the host environment to function incorrectly.
