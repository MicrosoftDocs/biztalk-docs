# OLE DB Provider-Specific Property Support in the OLE DB Provider for Informix
The following table summarizes the provider-specific OLE DB version 2.8 properties in the DBPROPSET_DBINIT property set that are supported by the version of Microsoft OLE DB Provider for Informix included with Host Integration Server.  
  
|OLE DB Property ID|Description|  
|------------------------|-----------------|  
|DBPROP_INFORMIX_AUTHENTICATION|Instructs the Data Provider on how to secure the authentication and data when connecting to the Data Source. This required property accepts a VT_BSTR value. The default value is Server.|  
|DBPROP_INFORMIX_NEWPWD|Instructs the Data Provider to use PCM (Password Change Management) to replace an existing password with a new password. This optional property accepts a VT_BSTR value. The default value is an empty string.|  
|DBPROP_INFORMIX_CLIENTAPPNAME|Instructs the Data Provider to send a client application name string to the Data Source at connection. This optional property accepts a VT_BSTR value. The default value is an empty string. Data Source administrators can use this information for accounting, logging and troubleshooting purposes.|  
|DBPROP_INFORMIX_CLIENTUSERID|Instructs the Data Provider to send a client user identifier string to the Data Source at connection. This optional property accepts a VT_BSTR value. The default value is an empty string. Data Source administrators can use this information for accounting, logging and troubleshooting purposes.|  
|DBPROP_INFORMIX_CLIENTACCTNG|Instructs the Data Provider to send a client accounting information string to the Data Source at connection. This optional property accepts a VT_BSTR value. The default value is an empty string. Data Source administrators can use this information for accounting, logging and troubleshooting purposes.|  
|DBPROP_INFORMIX_WRKSTNNAME|Instructs the Data Provider to send a client workstation name string to the Data Source at connection. This optional property accepts a VT_BSTR value. The default value is an empty string. Data Source administrators can use this information for accounting, logging and troubleshooting purposes.|  
|DBPROP_INFORMIX_DEFPREP|Instructs the Data Provider to optimize the processing of parameterized database commands. This optional property accepts a VT_BOOL value. The default value is false. For INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE commands, the Data Provider can combine PREPARE, EXECUTE, and COMMIT commands into one network flow to the remote database. For the SELECT command, the Data Provider combines PREPARE and EXECUTE commands into one network flow. This optimization minimizes network traffic and can improve overall performance|  
|DBPROP_INFORMIX_EARLYMETADATA|Instructs the Data Provider to use early metadata (parameter and column data types) defined at design time or late metadata defined at runtime. This optional property accepts a VT_BOOL value. The default value is false. Optionally, specify true when working with data consumer programs that offer a design time option to derive data types or verify the early metadata. Specify true when using SQL Server Integration Services and Distributed Query Processor four-part linked server queries. Specify true when using Informix BLOB, CLOB, XML, NUMERIC, and UDT with most other data consumers.|  
|DBPROP_INFORMIX_DERPARMS|Instructs the Data Provider to verify and correct parameter lengths for character data types, on behalf of data consumers such as SQL Server Integration Services package designer and import/export wizard. This optional property accepts a VT_BOOL value. The default value is false. This feature is not required when you are using SQL Server Replication Services or other SQL Server consumers.|  
|DBPROP_INFORMIX_CERTICATECN|Instructs the Data Provider to connect using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption. This optional property accepts a VT_BSTR value. The default value is an empty string.|  
|DBPROP_INFORMIX_ROWSETCACHESIZE|Instructs the Data Provider to pre-fetch rows from Informix while concurrently processing and returning rows to the data consumer on calls to IRowset::GetNextRows. This feature may improve performance in bulk read-only operations on multiprocessor computers. This required property accepts a VT_I4 value. The default value is 0, which indicates that the optional pre-fetch feature is off. We recommend setting a value between 50 and 200, with an initial recommended value of 100. This instructs the Data Provider to pre-fetch up to the specified number of row batches, which are stored in the Data Provider's Rowset cache. The size of the row batches is automatically determined based on the value for cRows on the OLE DB IRowset::GetNextRows interface specified by the consumer.|  
|DBPROP_INFORMIX_HOSTCCSID|Data Provider requires a value for Host CCSID (Coded Character Set Identifier) with which to perform code page conversions on string data. This required property accepts a VT_I4 value. The default value is Unicode – UTF8 [1208].|  
|DBPROP_INFORMIX_PCCODEPAGE|Data Provider requires a value for PC Code Page with which to perform code page conversions on string data. This required property accepts a VT_I4 value. The default value is Unicode – UTF8 [1208]. Typically, data consumers use either Unicode or ANSI (American National Standards Institute).|  
|DBPROP_INFORMIX_MAXPOOLSIZE|Instructs the Data Provider the maximum number of connections that can exist in the connection pool when connection pooling is enabled for the data source. This optional property accepts a VT_I4 value. The default value is 100. There is no upper limit for the Max Pool Size property. If you configure a value that is less than 0 for the Max Pool Size property, the default value of 100 is used.|  
|DBPROP_INFORMIX_NETADDRESS|Network address defines the TCP/IP address or alias of the Informix server in either IPv4 or IPv6 format. This required property accepts a VT_BSTR value. The default value is an empty string.|  
|DBPROP_INFORMIX_NETPORT|Network port defines the TCP/IP port number on which the Informix server listens for in-bound DRDA client connection requests. This required property accepts a VT_I4 value. The default value is 9089.|  
|DBPROP_INFORMIX_SCHEMA|Instructs the Data Provider to restrict schema queries to a single database schema, which improves efficiency and performance. This optional property accepts a VT_BSTR value of up to 128 bytes. The default value is an empty string. Informix database objects are organized into logical groups called schemas. The schema name is used to catalog SQL objects such as tables and views, using a two-part naming convention \<SCHEMA>.\<OBJECTNAME>. At design time, to construct SQL such as SELECT statements, data consumers can present to the user a list of all objects in the database catalog.|  
|DBPROP_INFORMIX_DBMSPLATFORM|DBMS platform defines the operating system of the Informix server. The Data Provider uses this value to convert data types to a format supported by this platform. This required property accepts a VT_BSTR value. The default value is NT.|  
|DBPROP_INFORMIX_AFFLIATEAPP|Affiliate Application is an Enterprise Single Sign-Son set of mapped credentials associated with a Data Source. This optional property accepts a VT_BSTR value. The default value is an empty string. Contact your ESSO administrator for the Affiliate application name.|  
|DBPROP_INFORMIX_PRINCIPLENAME|Service Principal name (SPN) is the name by which the Data Provider uniquely identifies the user when connecting to the Informix server. This optional property accepts a VT_BSTR value of up to 128 bytes. The default value is an empty string.|  
|DBPROP_INFORMIX_AUTOCOMMIT|Instructs the Data Provider to implicitly commit all SQL statements. This optional property accepts a VT_BOOL value. The default value is false.|  
|DBPROP_INFORMIX_CONNPOOLING|Instructs the Data Provider to use client-side connection pooling. This optional property accepts a VT_BOOL value. The default value is false.|  
|DBPROP_INFORMIX_UNITSOFWORK|Instructs the Data Provider whether to protect transactional units of work. This required property accepts a VT_BSTR value. The default value is RUW (unprotected Remote Unit of Work). An optional value is DUW (protected Distributed Unit of Work).|  
|DBPROP_INFORMIX_LOADBALANCING|Instructs the Data Provider to utilize the server list returned by an Informix database server, to re-connect to the most available server in a group, in support of client transaction load balancing. This optional property accepts a VT_BOOL value. The default value is false.|  
|DBPROP_INFORMIX_QUOTEDPREFIX|Instructs the Data Provider to use a quoted prefix and quoted suffix to delimit string identifiers. This optional property accepts a VT_BOOL value. The default value is false.|
