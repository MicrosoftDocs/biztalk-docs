# Link Characteristics
Before the driver can transfer any data, it needs information about the link. This includes the following:  
  
- The frame size.  
  
- The station address to listen on (if required).  
  
- Details of hardware selectable options, such as SDLC/HDLC, Internal/External clocking, and so on.  
  
  For more details of these options, refer to the topic [Function 0x42: Set Link Characteristics](./function-0x42-set-link-characteristics1.md).
