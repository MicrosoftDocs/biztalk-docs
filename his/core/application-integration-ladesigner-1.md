To create, view, and edit metadata objects that map to mainframe programs and data, you can use the HIS Designer for Logic Apps. This designer is a standalone tool with a graphical user interface that works with Microsoft Visual Studio.

## [Designing artifacts for CICS and IMS Integration](application-integration-lahostapps.md) 

CICS and IMS are two of the most used mainframe systems in the world. This linked article shows how to design the artifacts required by Azure Logic Apps to invoke these systems using low code techniques.

## [Designing artifacts for Host Files Integration](application-integration-lahostfiles.md)

IBM host files, such as VSAM files, preserve data used in various mission-critical scenarios. This linked article shows how to design artifacts needed by Azure Logic Apps to operate on this data offline in high throughput scenarios.
