# Planning APPC Connectivity
A peer-oriented SNA network, using the Advanced Program-to-Program Communications (APPC) protocol, relies on each device in the network to communicate directly with the others. Each computer depends primarily on its own intelligence and does not require constant access to a centrally located host computer.  
  
 APPC supports display and other application services across an SNA network. Although peer-oriented SNA networks are usually associated with an AS/400 host system, mainframe systems can also support peer-to-peer networking.  
  
 Once you establish the physical connection from [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../core/includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] to the AS/400, you need to determine the types of APPC services required by your users. This section discusses the APPC services that Host Integration Server can provide to your users and tells how to set up these services.
