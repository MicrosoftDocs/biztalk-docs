# Specifying a File
After you have defined the settings for transferring files, you can send a file to the host or receive a file from the host. You can select a file to transfer in one of two ways: by typing the name of the specific file to send or receive, or by browsing through a list of available files.  
  
 **To type the name of a specific file**  
  
1. On the **Transfer** menu, click **Send File** or **Receive File**. Either the Send File dialog box or Receive File dialog box appears.  
  
2. In the **PC File Name** box, type the name of the file to send or receive. Note that when receiving a file from the host application, if you type the name of an existing PC file, it will be overwritten by the host file.  
  
3. To review your settings, click **Settings**.  
  
   **To browse through a list of available files**  
  
4. On the **Transfer** menu, click **Send File** or **Receive File**. Either the Send File dialog box or Receive File dialog box appears.  
  
5. Click **Browse**. The **Open** dialog box appears.  
  
6. In the **File Name** list, select the file you want to send or receive. To see files of another type, select the type from the **List Files of Type** box.  
  
7. Click **OK**. The Send File or Receive File dialog box reappears with your selection in the PC File Name box.  
  
8. To review your settings, click **Settings**; to continue.
