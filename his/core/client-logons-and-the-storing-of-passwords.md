# Client Logons and the Storing of Passwords
For security reasons, a user at a client computer may have to log on several times before obtaining access through [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../core/includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] to an IBM mainframe (z/OS) midrange (i5/OS) server. Users may not always find this to be convenient. The logons are necessary because starting an SNA session requires several kinds of access: access to the Windows domain, access to a Host Integration Server computer, access to the mainframe or midrange server and, possibly, access to programs on the mainframe or AS/400. An example of such a program is an midrange RPG for i5/OS program that uses conversation security when communicating with 5250 emulators. Each layer of access may require an additional logon depending on the operating system and the client/server protocol used on the client.  
  
 The Enterprise Single Sign-On feature of [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../core/includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] can reduce or even eliminate these multiple logons on Windows-based networks. If you are not able to take advantage of this feature, users can avoid multiple logons by following the procedures outlined in the following sections.
