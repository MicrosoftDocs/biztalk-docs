# Critical Failure
When an application makes a protocol error in sending data, the local node rejects the data using a [Status-Acknowledge(Nack-2)](./status-acknowledge-nack-2-2.md) with a sense code indicating the reason for failure. This message has a critical failure flag that indicates whether the local node has marked the session as unrecoverable. The sense codes are listed in [FMI Status, Error, and Sense Codes](../core/fmi-status-error-and-sense-codes1.md).  
  
 If the error is noncritical, the application can proceed as if the message that caused the error had not been sent. If the error is critical, the local node issues a [Close(PLU) Request](./close-plu-request2.md) to the application (providing that the primary logical unit (PLU) connection is open), which means that the application cannot communicate on the PLU-SLU session until an **UNBINDâ€“BIND** sequence is received from the host. The local node also sends a **TERM-SELF** request to the host to elicit an **UNBIND**. Therefore, the application does not need to issue a **LOGOFF** request on the system services control point (SSCP) session.
