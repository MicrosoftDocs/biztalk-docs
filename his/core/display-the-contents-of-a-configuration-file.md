# Display the Contents of a Configuration File
You can create a display of the entire contents of a configuration file by using the **/display** option with the following syntax:  
  
```  
  
[configpath]   
```  
  
 When you use the **/display** option, all the resources in the configuration file are displayed. For each resource, the display is the same as that from typing **snacfg** *resource* *resourcename*, where *resource* is the second word of a **snacfg** command (for example, **appcllu**, **connection**, or **server**), and *resourcename* is the name of the corresponding resource. (The exception to this is that the display of the "diagnostic" resource is the same as that from **snacfg diagnostic /list**.)
