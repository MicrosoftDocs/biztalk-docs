# Computers Node
Use the **Computers** node to view all the computers that have Transaction Integrator (TI) installed on them and are referenced in the same TI Manager configuration database (MSHIS60_HIP).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If the computer you are looking for does not appear in this list, the computer might be registered in a different configuration database. After you have installed TI, run the **Microsoft Host Integration Server Configuration Wizard** and configure the new computer to use the same Transaction Integrator configuration database as the other computers. You can select the same configuration database by changing the **Server** and **Database** settings on the **Database Configurations** wizard page.  
  
 Double-click the **Computers** node to expand the node. The right pane displays the following information about the node:  
  
-   **Computer**. Displays the name of the HIP-enabled computer.  
  
 Right-click the **Computers** node to display the following four options:  
  
-   **View**. Displays the following menu items:  
  
    -   **Add/Remove Columns**. Allows you to choose the properties that are displayed in the list view. You can display each property as a separate column in the right pane.  
  
    -   **Large Icons**. Displays large icons for items in the right pane.  
  
    -   **Small Icons**. Displays small icons for items in the right pane.  
  
    -   **List**. Displays only the small icons and the names of the nodes in the right pane.  
  
    -   **Detail**. Displays the small icons and the properties of the nodes in the right pane.  
  
    -   **Customize**. Allows you to change the options to show or hide items displayed in the right pane.  
  
-   **Refresh**. Redraws the screen to show any updates.  
  
-   **Export List**. Allows you to save the list of computers as a separate text or Unicode text file.  
  
-   **Help**. Displays a Help topic (this topic) that explains the items that appear in the TI Manager console and the actions you can take.
