# CPI-C Calls in C Programs (CPI-C)
This implementation of Common Programming Interface for Communications (CPI-C) is available to programs written in Microsoft® C version 6 or later.  
  
 The WINCPIC.H header file defines the prototypes for each CPI-C function. Other definitions include:  
  
-   Types specifically defined for use by CPI-C parameters.  
  
-   The structure of the side information entries.  
  
-   Symbolic names defined for integer parameters.  
  
 To use CPI-C calls, the C program must include WINCPIC.H and declare the variables to be used in passing parameters on CPI-C calls.  
  
 Note that you must define WIN32® before including WINCPIC.H  
  
 For example:  
  
```  
#define WIN32  
#include <wincpic.h>  
```  
  
 In the case of strings, the program must also determine the preferred string length.
