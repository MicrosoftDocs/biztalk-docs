# Relationships between the .NET Provider for DB2 Interfaces
The Managed Provider for DB2 interfaces interact in different waysâ€”with the exception of MsDb2DataAdapter, the remaining classes adhere to a rigid parent/child relationship:  
  
-   An MsDb2Connection can have one MsDb2Transaction running, although it can have multiple MsDb2Commands.  
  
-   An MsDb2Transaction can have one or more MsDb2Commands running.  
  
-   An MsDb2Command owns one MsDb2ParameterCollection, which stores multiple MsDb2Parameters.  
  
     An MsDb2Command can also create a single MsDb2DataReader for parsing one or more resultsets.  
  
 The MsDb2DataAdapter takes advantage of all the other Managed Provider interfaces. The MsDb2DataAdapter serves as the gateway between a host DB2 system and a client-side ADO.NET DataSet. The DataSet is an important piece of the .NET data framework because it provides a mechanism for caching data in a managed environment and inferring XML schema information, basically providing a gateway between DB2 data and Microsoft Web services.
