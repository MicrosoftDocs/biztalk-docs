# Creating and Configuring LUs
After you configure the connection, you can create the 3270 LUs. The LUs can be display LUs (terminal emulation), printer LUs, application LUs (LUAs), or downstream LUs.  
  
 Each 3270 LU is configured based on the type of connection used. If the connection is channel, 802.2, X.25, or Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC), the LUs need an LU number, which identifies the LU on its connection. This number should match the LOCADDR= parameter of the LU definition in Virtual Telecommunications Access Method (VTAM) or in the Network Control Program (NET) Gen. Up to 254 LUs can be configured for each connection, and they can be consecutively configured as a range of LUs.  
  
 You can create LUs one at a time or in a consecutively numbered range. When you create a range of LUs, all the LUs are given the same properties. You can modify individual LUs after creating them.

### To modify a 3270 LU  
  
1.  In SNA Manager, ensure that the appropriate service is inactive by right-clicking **SNA service**, and then click **Stop**.  
  
2.  Double-click **Connections**, and then double-click the connection that contains the LU you want to view.  
  
3.  Right-click the LU whose properties you want to view, and then click **Properties**. Click the appropriate tab to view or modify the LU properties.  
  
4.  Click **Save Configuration** on the **Action** menu if you made changes, and then restart the affected service.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Restarting the server disconnects all users. Try to schedule configuration changes when they least affect users.
