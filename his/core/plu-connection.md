# PLU Connection
The primary logical unit (PLU) connection of the application to the local node provides access to the PLU session between the Microsoft® Host Integration Server's logical unit (LU) and a PLU in the host.  
  
 This section describes how an application opens and closes its PLU connection, and the use of the PLU connection.  
  
 For simplicity, this section describes the PLU connection as if an application uses only a single SNA server LU (and therefore a single PLU connection). In practice, applications can use multiple LUs.
