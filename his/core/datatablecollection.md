# DataTableCollection
An ADO.NET `DataSet` contains a collection of zero or more tables represented by `DataTable` objects. The `DataTableCollection` contains all the `DataTable` objects in a `DataSet`.  
  
 A `DataTable` is defined in the `System.Data` namespace and represents a single table of memory-resident data. It contains a collection of columns represented by a `DataColumnCollection`, and constraints represented by a `ConstraintCollection`, which together define the schema of the table. A `DataTable` object also contains a collection of rows represented by the `DataRowCollection`, which contains the data in the table. Along with its current state, a `DataRow` object retains both its current and original versions to identify changes to the values stored in the row.
