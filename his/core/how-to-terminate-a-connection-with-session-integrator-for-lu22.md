# How to Terminate a Connection with Session Integrator for LU2
After you have finished sending and receiving information on your LU2 connection, you must shut your connection down with a call to `Microsoft.HostIntegration.SNA.Session.SessionDisplay.Disconnect%2A`.  
  
## Shut an LU2 connection down  
  
1.  When you are finished with your connection, call `SessionDisplay.Disconnect` to disconnect.  
  
## Example  
 The following code example is from the 3270 application in the Host Integration Server SDK.  
  
```  
private void Disconnect_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)  
        {  
            // Disable every button and text box.  
            DisableEverything();  
  
            m_Handler.Disconnect();  
  
            // Go back to the original state of buttons.  
            SetOpeningState();  
        }  
```
