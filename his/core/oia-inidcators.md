# OIA Inidcators
The Operator Information Area (OIA) is used to display the status of a 3270 screen session. The OIA is the last (bottom) line display in the terminal window of the 3270 session. Except for the initial three positions (system connection indicators), status line indicators only appear when they apply.  
  
 The following tables describe the OIA and explain each indicator. In the table, position refers to the column(s) that a specific indicator occupies on the OIA, where the left-most column of the OIA is position 1. Note that the "female" symbol used for certain system connection and input-inhibited indicators cannot be displayed in this table. In its place is the "^" symbol.  
  
 Following is a list of symbols found on each system connection and their respective meanings.
