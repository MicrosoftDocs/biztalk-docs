# Load Balancing and Hot Backup
Load balancing and hot backup allow for scalable applications and increased performance on enterprise systems. Deploying multiple servers increases application throughput by distributing the load based on rules that are defined by the load balancing engine. Load balancing services also increase availability by detecting connection failures and providing redundant resources for client applications.  
  
 Transaction Integrator (TI) can be deployed taking advantage of several load balancing and hot backup solutions. The topics in this section describe the various load balancing and hot backup methods that TI supports today.
