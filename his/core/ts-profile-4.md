# TS Profile 4
Transmission service (TS) Profile 4 is supported on logical unit-logical unit (LU-LU) sessions using LU types 0 or 1. This profile specifies the following session rules:  
  
-   Primary logical unit-secondary logical unit (PLU-SLU) and SLU-PLU normal flows are paced.  
  
-   Sequence numbers are used on the normal flows whenever the transmission header (TH) format used includes a sequence number field.  
  
-   SDT, CLEAR, RQR, and STSN are supported.  
  
-   CRV is supported when session-level cryptography is selected via a BIND parameter.  
  
 The TS usage subfields defining the options for this profile are the following:  
  
-   Pacing window counts  
  
-   Maximum request/response (RU) sizes on the normal flows
