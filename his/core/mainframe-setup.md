# Mainframe Setup
The primary purpose of the BizTalk Adapter for Host Applications is to connect to an application that is running on a remote mainframe. Therefore, the first step in writing your BizTalk application is to confirm that the host mainframe is, in fact, running the specified application, and that you can access the mainframe from your system.  
  
 How to create, load, and troubleshoot a remote host application is beyond the scope of this topic. You should work with your mainframe developer to create and load an application onto the specified mainframe. You can also work with a mainframe system developer to access the mainframe from your system.  
  
 In addition, the SDK for the BizTalk Adapter for Host Applications includes a detailed readme on how to create and load a sample mainframe application. For more information, see [*installation directory*]\Microsoft Host Integration Server\SDK\Samples\AppInt\BizTalkHostApplications\\. This directory contains instructions on how to set up a mainframe sample application, in addition to several variations on how to set different network protocols for the sample.
