# Confirmation Processing (CPI-C)
The sequence of events for confirmation processing is as follows:  
  
1.  Establish the synchronization level.  
  
2.  Send a confirmation request.  
  
3.  Receive data and confirmation request.  
  
4.  Respond to the confirmation request.  
  
5.  Deallocate the conversation.  
  
 Using confirmation processing, a transaction program (TP) sends a confirmation request with the data. The partner TP confirms receipt of the data or indicates that an error occurred. Each time the two TPs exchange a confirmation request and response, they are synchronized.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Although the example in this section does not show this, any TP can send or receive data, regardless of whether the TP is the invoking TP or the invokable TP.  
  
 The following table illustrates the steps involved in confirmation processing.  
  
|Step|Issued by the invoking TP|Issued by the invokable TP|  
|----------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|  
|1|Initialize_Conversation||  
|2|Set_Sync_Level   (*sync_level*=CM_CONFIRM)||  
|3|Allocate||  
|4|Send_Data||  
|5|Confirm||  
|6||Accept_Conversation|  
|7||Receive     (data_received=       CM_COMPLETE_DATA_RECEIVED)     (status_received=       CM_CONFIRM_RECEIVED)|  
|8||Confirmed|  
|9|(*return_code*=CM_OK)||  
|10|Send_Data||  
|11|Deallocate||  
|12||Receive|  
|13||(status_received=       CM_CONFIRM_DEALLOC_RECEIVED)|  
|14||Confirmed|  
|15|(return_code=CM_OK)||  
  
## Establishing the Synchronization Level  
 The [Set_Sync_Level](../Topic/Set_Sync_Level%20\(CPI-C\)2.md) call lets you override the default synchronization level of the conversation. The synchronization level is one of the conversation's characteristics. There are two possible synchronization levels:  
  
-   CM_CONFIRM, under which the TPs can request confirmation of receipt of data and respond to such requests.  
  
-   CM_NONE, the default, under which confirmation processing does not occur.  
  
 The [Initialize_Conversation](../Topic/Initialize_Conversation%20\(CPI-C\)2.md) call sets the default characteristics of a conversation. There are several calls that begin with **Set_**. These calls let you override the default conversation characteristics.  
  
## Sending a Confirmation Request  
 Issuing the [Confirm](../Topic/Confirm%20\(CPI-C\)1.md) call has two effects:  
  
-   It flushes the local LU's send buffer and sends any data contained in the buffer to the partner TP.  
  
-   It sends a confirmation request that the partner TP receives through the *status_received* parameter of a [Receive](../Topic/Receive%20\(CPI-C\)1.md) call.  
  
 After issuing **Confirm**, the local TP waits for confirmation from the partner TP.  
  
## Receiving a Confirmation Request  
 The *status_received* parameter of the [Receive](../Topic/Receive%20\(CPI-C\)1.md) call indicates any future action required by the local TP.  
  
 In the example, the first Receive has a *status_received* of CM_CONFIRM_RECEIVED, indicating that a confirmation is required before the partner TP can continue.  
  
## Responding to a Confirmation Request  
 The partner TP issues the [Confirmed](../Topic/Confirmed%20\(CPI-C\)1.md) call to confirm receipt of data. This frees the local TP to resume processing.  
  
## Deallocating the Conversation  
 Because the synchronization level of the conversation is set to CM_CONFIRM, [Deallocate](../Topic/Deallocate%20\(CPI-C\)2.md) sends a confirmation request with the data flushed from the buffer.  
  
 For the second [Receive](../Topic/Receive%20\(CPI-C\)1.md) call, *status_received* is CM_CONFIRM_DEALLOC_RECEIVED, indicating that the partner TP requires a confirmation, generated by the [Confirmed](../Topic/Confirmed%20\(CPI-C\)1.md) call, before the conversation can be deallocated.
