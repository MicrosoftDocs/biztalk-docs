# XID Retries
When the local node specifies that the SNALink is to send an exchange identification (XID), either by supplying it on the [Open(LINK) Request](../Topic/Open\(LINK\)%20Request2.md) or by sending it on a [Send-XID](../Topic/Send-XID2.md) message, it is the responsibility of the SNALink to perform any retries.  
  
 XIDs need to be retried because:  
  
-   The remote station has not been started yet.  
  
-   Frames may be lost on the line due to noise.  
  
 Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) SNALinks should implement a contact time-out and a retry limitâ€”values for these are provided on the [Open(LINK)](../Topic/Open\(LINK\)2.md) message. The time-out specifies how often the XID should be retried, and the retry limit specifies how many XIDs should be sent before abandoning the connection activation and sending an [Outage](../Topic/Outage1.md) message to the local node. The SNALink should stop retrying the XID when one of the following occurs:  
  
-   It receives an XID from the remote station.  
  
-   An [Open(STATION)](../Topic/Open\(STATION\)2.md) message is received from the node.  
  
-   A mode-setting command is received on the link.
