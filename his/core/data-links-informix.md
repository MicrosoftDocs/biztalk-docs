# Data Links (Informix)
Data consumers, such as Visual Studio and SQL Server, use the Data Links dialog to configure connections to IBM Informix database servers. Data Links can save a data source definition as an OLE DB universal data link (UDL) file, which allows the user to share configurations between applications, users, and computers.  
  
 You can create a data link by clicking the Data Access Tool shortcut in the Host Integration Server 2013 program folder. You can then modify the UDL using the Data Links tool by opening the file from Windows Explorer, which loads the standard OLE DB Data Links user interface.  
  
 To start the Data Access tool, click the Data Access Tool shortcut in the Host Integration Server 2013 program folder or click Start, Programs, Microsoft Host Integration Server 2013 and then Data Access Tool.  
  
## Provider  
 Use the Provider tab to select the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for Informix from the list of OLE DB Providers. The provider name is MSINFORMIX.1.

 The Quoted Prefix property instructs the Data Provider to use a quoted prefix and quoted suffix to delimit string identifiers. This optional property accepts a Boolean value. The default value is false.  
  
### Rowset Cache Size  
 The Rowset Cache Size property instructs the Data Provider to pre-fetch rows from Informix while concurrently processing and returning rows to the data consumer on calls to IRowset::GetNextRows. This feature may improve performance in bulk read-only operations on multiprocessor computers. This required property accepts an integer value. The default value is 0, which indicates that the optional pre-fetch feature is off. We recommend setting a value between 50 and 200, with an initial recommended value of 100. This instructs the Data Provider to pre-fetch up to the specified number of row batches, which are stored in the Data Provider's rowset cache. The size of the row batches is automatically determined based on the value for cRows on the OLE DB IRowset::GetNextRows interface specified by the consumer.  
  
### Units of Work  
 The Units of Work property instructs the Data Provider whether to protect transactional units of work. This required property accepts a string value. The default value is RUW (unprotected Remote Unit of Work). An optional value is DUW (protected Distributed Unit of Work).  
  
### Use Early Metadata  
 The **Use Early Metadata** property instructs the Data Provider to use early metadata (parameter and column data types) defined at design time or late metadata defined at runtime. This optional property accepts a **Boolean** value. The default value is **false**. Optionally, specify **true** when working with data consumer programs that offer a design time option to derive data types or verify the early metadata. Specify true when using SQL Server Integration Services and Distributed Query Processor four-part linked server queries. Specify true when using Informix BLOB, CLOB, XML, NUMERIC, and UDT with most other data consumers.  
  
### User ID  
 The User ID property instructs the Data Provider the user name (identifier) value to use when connecting to an Informix database server using interactive sign-on authentication. Interactive sign-on security relies on a user name and password that you enter at runtime or that is stored in a configuration file or data consumer configuration store, such as an Integration Services package. This optional property accepts a string value. The default value is an empty string. Informix running on Windows operating systems accepts a 20 character user name.
