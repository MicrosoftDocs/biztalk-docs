# Managed Provider Programmer&#39;s Guide
A Managed Provider is a .NET Framework data provider that is used for connecting [!INCLUDE[hishostintegrationserver2009](../core/includes/hishostintegrationserver2009-md.md)] applications to a database, executing commands, and retrieving results. Those results are processed directly, placed in an ADO.NET DataSet to be exposed to the user, combined with data from multiple sources, or accessed remotely between tiers. A Host Integration Server Managed Provider is designed to be lightweight, creating a minimal layer between the data source and your code, and increasing performance without sacrificing functionality.
