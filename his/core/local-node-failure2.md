# Local Node Failure
If the local node fails, applications are informed of this by the path error return code from the Dynamic Access Module (DMOD) on the [sbpurcvx](./sbpurcvx1.md) call, or from the routing procedure. All connections that use the destination locality value for which the path error is reported are closed. The application must do the following:  
  
-   Clean up resources related to the closed connections, including resetting presentation spaces and displaying a communications check code  
  
     (â€“+z_nnn) on the status line.  
  
-   Attempt to reestablish connection with a local node by reinitiating the resource location process.
