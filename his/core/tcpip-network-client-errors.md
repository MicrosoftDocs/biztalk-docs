# TCPIP Network Client Errors
The following table lists TCPIP Network Client error constants, values, SqlState, SqlCode and a description of the error.  
  
||||  
|-|-|-|  
|**SqlState**|**SqlCode**|**Description**|  
|08S01|-602|**Message** : Could not resolve the specified host name.<br /><br /> **Reason** : The client could not connect to the DB2 server with an incorrect user-specified Network Address or Network Port value.<br /><br /> **Action** : Verify connection information to ensure the Network Address and Network Port specified matches the server. For more information, see topics on Network Address and Network Port, at http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/gg166058(v=BTS.70).aspx#tcpip3.|  
|08S01|-603|**Message** : Could not connect to specified host.<br /><br /> **Reason** : The client could not connect to the DB2 server with an incorrect user-specified Network Address or Network Port value, or the server is unavailable.<br /><br /> **Action** : Verify connection information to ensure the Network Address and Network Port specified matches the server. Contact the network administrator or server administrator. For more information, see topics on Network Address and Network Port, at http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/gg166058(v=BTS.70).aspx#tcpip3.|  
|08S01|-604|**Message** : Socket allocation failed.<br /><br /> **Reason** : The client failed to connect to the DB2 server via a TCP/IP network, when all of the local client socket resources were in use.<br /><br /> **Action** : Close unused client connections. Utilize client connection pooling. For more information, see topic on Connection Pooling, at ms-help://MS.HIS.2010/HIS2010/html/9e844d5c-d177-41d4-9489-2a29b919efcf.htm#adv8.|

|08S01|-606|**Message** : Enterprise single sign-on failure: Could not contact the SSO server \<server-name>. Check that SSO is configured and that the SSO service is running on hat server.<br /><br /> **Reason** : The Enterprise Single Sign-On server is not configured or running.<br /><br /> **Action** : Verify connection information to ensure the ESSO Affiliate Application name matches the value for the server and current user defined by the Enterprise Single Sign-On administrator. Check with your Enterprise Single Sign-On Administrator. Configure an alternative authentication method. For more information, see topic on Security Method, at ms-help://MS.HIS.2010/HIS2010/html/7478b857-6095-4905-a0ae-00b8733e71c5.htm.|  
|08S01|10093|**Message** : A TCPIP socket error has occurred (10014): The sockaddr structure pointed to by the name contains incorrect address format for the associated address family or the namelen parameter is too small. This error is also returned if the sockaddr structure pointed to by the name parameter with a length specified in the namelen parameter is not in a valid part of the user address space.<br /><br /> **Reason** : The client is attempting to connect to the DB2 server using an improperly-formatted IPv6 Network Address.<br /><br /> **Action** : Verify connection information to ensure the Network Address specified matches the server and requirements for either an IPv4 or IPv6 network. For more information, see topic on Network Address, at ms-help://MS.HIS.2010/HIS2010/html/9e844d5c-d177-41d4-9489-2a29b919efcf.htm#tcpip3.|

For more information on command and data type limits, see topic on Data Type Mappings, at ms-help://MS.HIS.2010/HIS2010/html/cca7e3a6-6160-48ca-89d2-90318900807f.htm.|  
|08S01|10014|**Message** : A TCPIP socket error has occurred (10043): The specified protocol is not supported.<br /><br /> **Reason** : The client is attempting to connect to the DB2 server using an access method that is not supported by the DB2 server, such as Secure Sockets Layer or Transport Layer Security.<br /><br /> **Action** : Verify connection information to ensure the DB2 server support SSL or TLS. Configure a TCP/IP network without specifying SSL or TLS. Contact the network administrator or server administrator.

|08S01|10053|**Message** : A TCPIP socket error has occurred (10053): For a connection-oriented socket, this error indicates that the connection has been broken due to keep-alive activity detecting a failure while the operation was in progress. For a datagram socket, this error indicates that the time to live has expired.<br /><br /> **Reason** : The server closed the client connection.<br /><br /> **Action** : Contact the network administrator or server administrator.|  
|08S01|10060|**Message** : A TCPIP socket error has occurred (10052): The connection has been broken due to the keep-alive activity detecting a failure while the operation was in progress.<br /><br /> **Reason** : The server closed the client connection.<br /><br /> **Action** : Contact the network administrator or server administrator.|  
|08S01|10054|**Message** : A TCPIP socket error has occurred (10053): An established connection was aborted by the software in your host machine.<br /><br /> **Reason** : The server closed the client connection.<br /><br /> **Action** : Contact the network administrator or server administrator.|  
|08S01|10052|**Message** : A TCPIP socket error has occurred (10054): The virtual circuit was reset by the remote side executing a hard or abortive close. The application should close the socket as it is no longer usable. On a UPD-datagram socket this error would indicate that a previous send operation resulted in an ICMP "Port Unreachable" message.<br /><br /> **Reason** : The server closed the client connection.<br /><br /> **Action** : Contact the network administrator or server administrator.|  
|08S01|10055|**Message** : A TCPIP socket error has occurred (10055): No buffer space is available.<br /><br /> **Reason** : The client failed to connect to the DB2 server via a TCP/IP network, when all of the local client socket resources were in use.<br /><br /> **Action** : Close unused client connections. Utilize client connection pooling. For more information, see topic on Connection Pooling, at ms-help://MS.HIS.2010/HIS2010/html/9e844d5c-d177-41d4-9489-2a29b919efcf.htm#adv8.|  
|08S01|10057|**Message** : A TCPIP socket error has occurred (10057): A request to send or receive data was disallowed because the socket is not connected and (when sending on a datagram socket using a sendto call) no address was supplied.<br /><br /> **Reason** : The client could not connect to the DB2 server with an incorrect user-specified Network Address or Network Port value.<br /><br /> **Action** : Verify connection information to ensure the Network Address and Network Port specified matches the server. For more information, see topics on Network Address and Network Port, at ms-help://MS.HIS.2010/HIS2010/html/9e844d5c-d177-41d4-9489-2a29b919efcf.htm#tcpip3.|

|08S01|10024|**Message** : A TCPIP socket error has occurred (10061): The attempt to connect was forcefully rejected.<br /><br /> **Reason** : The client could not connect to the DB2 server with an incorrect user-specified Network Address or Network Port value.<br /><br /> **Action** : Verify connection information to ensure the Network Address and Network Port specified matches the server. For more information, see topics on Network Address and Network Port, at ms-help://MS.HIS.2010/HIS2010/html/9e844d5c-d177-41d4-9489-2a29b919efcf.htm#tcpip3.|  
|08S01|10043|**Message** : A TCPIP socket error has occurred (10065): A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable host.<br /><br /> **Reason** : The client could not connect to the DB2 server with an incorrect user-specified Network Address or Network Port value, or the server is unavailable.<br /><br /> **Action** : Verify connection information to ensure the Network Address and Network Port specified matches the server.

|08S01|10050|**Message** : A TCPIP socket error has occurred (10093): A successful WSAStartup call must occur before using this function. For more information, see http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms742213(VS.85).aspx.<br /><br /> **Reason** : The client failed to connect to the DB2 server via a TCP/IP network, when all of the local client socket connections were in use.<br /><br /> **Action** : Close unused client connections.
