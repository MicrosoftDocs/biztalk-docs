# PLU Session Status
While the primary logical unit (PLU) connection is open, the local node reports any changes of state to the application through [Status-Session](./status-session2.md) messages. There is only one **Status-Session** status code that can occur on the PLU connection, which is listed in the following table.  
  
|Status code|Description|  
|-----------------|-----------------|  
|BETB|The PLU session has made the transition from the in-bracket state to the between-bracket state. (For more information, see [Brackets](../core/brackets1.md).)|  
  
 [Status-Session Codes](../core/status-session-codes1.md) describes the **Status-Session** status codes.
