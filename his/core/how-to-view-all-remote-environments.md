# How to View All Remote Environments
Follow these steps to view all remote environments (RE):  
  
### To view the names and properties of the remote environments  
  
1.  In the left pane, click the **Remote environments** folder, and then click an RE name.  
  
2.  In the right pane, view the name and properties of each application running on the computer.  
  
    -   **Remote Environment**  
  
    -   **Type**  
  
### To view the operations available on a remote environment  
  
1.  In the left pane, click the remote environment name.  
  
2.  In the right pane, click the desired action:  
  
    -   **New**  
  
    -   **View** displays a list of menu items:  
  
         **Add/Remove Columns** enables you to choose which properties are displayed in the list view. All properties of the remote environment are viewable as a column.  
  
         **Large Icons** displays larger icons for items in the right pane.  
  
         **Small Icons** displays smaller icons for items in the right pane.  
  
         **List** displays only the smaller icons and the names of the applications in the right pane.  
  
         **Detail** displays the smaller icons and the properties of the applications in the right pane.  
  
         **Customize** enables you to change the options to show or hide items displayed in the right pane.  
  
    -   **Delete** deletes the remote environment from the computer. The deleted item is removed from the specific computer that it was defined on and from the administrative data store.  
  
    -   **Rename** renames the highlighted remote environment. The new name must be unique and is reflected across all elements of the host-initiated processing (HIP) console. The **Rename** operation does not affect the operation of Objects that have references to the remote environment. After the **Rename** operation is completed, any Objects that reference the remote environment continue to maintain their reference to the renamed remote environment.  
  
    -   **Refresh** redraws the screen to show any updates.  
  
    -   **Export List** enables you to save the list of remote environments as a separate file.  
  
    -   **Properties** enables you to view and change the properties of a remote environment.  
  
    -   **Help** displays an online Help topic explaining the items that appear in the Transaction Integrator (TI) Manager console and the actions you can take.
