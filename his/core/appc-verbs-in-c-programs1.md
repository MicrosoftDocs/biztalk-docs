# APPC Verbs in C Programs
This implementation of APPC is available for programs written in Microsoft® C version 5.1 or later. A C program calls APPC through the external function **APPC**. For compatibility with previous versions of Microsoft C, the external function **APPC_C** is also supported.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Compilers other than the Microsoft C compiler can also be used to build applications using this implementation of APPC.
