# SDLC Link Statistics
Link statistics are generated when a link is closed or when one of the wrap counters listed later in this section is about to wrap. Whenever a link statistics message is built, all the wrap counters are reset to 0. The cumulative counters are not reset; they provide statistics from the point at which the particular link service was started.  
  
 The NMVT generated has the following format:

## Cumulative Counters  
 The cumulative counters are the same counters as the wrap counters, with reserved bytes in the same positions.
