# Copying and Pasting Displayed Information
The 3270 Client allows you to make a copy of the information in the display, so that you can use that information in other applications. To do this, you select a portion of the displayed information, and then copy it to the Windows Clipboard. After copying information to the Clipboard, you can change to a different application and transfer the information into that application.  
  
 In reverse fashion, you can copy information from an application other than the Client, then paste the information into the Client. If the emulation session is in a state in which information can be received (indicated by the status line), the pasted information will be entered as a series of keystrokes.  
  
 **To copy and paste displayed information**  
  
1. Select the portion of the displayed information that you want to copy  
  
    -or-  
  
    on the **Edit** menu, click **Select All**.  
  
2. On the **Edit** menu, click **Copy**. The selection is copied to the Clipboard.  
  
3. Change to the program in which you will insert the contents of the Clipboard.  
  
4. Position the cursor at the location where you want to insert the contents of the Clipboard.  
  
5. On the **Edit** menu, click **Paste**.  
  
   **To copy information from an application and paste it into the Client window**  
  
6. From the application, copy information to the Clipboard by using the application’s standard copy command(s).  
  
7. Change to an active Client session, or start the Client and begin a session.  
  
8. Check to see that the session is in a state in which keystrokes can be received.  
  
9. On the **Edit** menu, click **Paste**. The copied information is entered as a series of keystrokes.
