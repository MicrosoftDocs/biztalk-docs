# How to Monitor the Health of Host Integration Server with WMI
Health monitoring refers to viewing the current status of different aspects of Host Integration Server through the **WmiSnaStatus** provider. You can access **WmiSnaStatus** provider in the same manner as you would any other instance and method provider. You use **ExecQuery** to query for the relevant information, and then display the information to screen or write the information to a log file. Some **WmiSnaStatus** classes also have methods that let you start and stop related services.  
  
### To monitor the health of Host Integration Server with WMI  
  
1.  Connect to the namespace using **GetObject** with a moniker in the parameter.  
  
2.  Retrieve the object representing the SNA Status provider using **ExecQuery**.  
  
3.  Use the information gathered from the **ExecQuery** as appropriate.  
  
 You can see an example of health monitoring in [How to Display Connection Status](../core/how-to-display-connection-status.md).
