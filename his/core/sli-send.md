# SLI_SEND
The **SLI_SEND** verb sends responses, SNA commands, and data from a Microsoft® Windows® logical unit application (LUA) application to a host logical unit (LU).  
  
 The following structure describes the LUA_COMMON member of the verb control block (VCB) used by SLI_SEND.  
  
 The second syntax union below describes the **LUA_SPECIFIC** member of the VCB used by **SLI_SEND**. Other union members are omitted for clarity.

 LUA_INVALID_MESSAGE_TYPE  
  
 Secondary return code; the **lua_message_type** parameter is not recognized by the LUA interface.  
  
 LUA_DATA_LENGTH_ERROR  
  
 Secondary return code; the application did not provide user-supplied data required by the verb issued. Note that when **SLI_SEND** is issued for an SNA LUSTAT command, status (in four bytes) is required, and that when [SLI_OPEN](../core/sli-open.md) is issued with secondary initialization, data is required.  
  
 LUA_STATE_CHECK  
 Primary return code; the verb did not execute because it was issued in an invalid state.  
  
 LUA_NO_SLI_SESSION  
  
 Secondary return code; a session was not open or was down due to an [SLI_CLOSE](../core/sli-close.md) or session failure when a command was issued.

 Secondary return code; the application responded negatively to an exception request. The sense code was unacceptable.  
  
 LUA_RESPONSE_OUT_OF_ORDER  
  
 Secondary return code; the current response was not for the oldest request. The determination was made by a protocol computer.  
  
 LUA_CHAIN_RESPONSE_REQUIRED  
  
 Secondary return code; a CHASE response was still outstanding when a more recent request was attempted. The determination was made by a protocol computer.  
  
 LUA_BRACKET  
  
 Secondary return code; the sender failed to enforce the session bracket rules. Note that contention and race conditions are exempt from this error. An invalid request header or request unit for the receivers current session control or data flow control state was found. Delivery to the half-session component was prevented.  
  
 LUA_DIRECTION  
  
 Secondary return code; while the half-duplex flip-flop state was NOT_RECEIVE, a request for normal flow was received. An invalid request header or request unit for the receivers current session control or data flow control state was found. Delivery to the half-session component was prevented.  
  
 LUA_DATA_TRAFFIC_RESET  
  
 Secondary return code; a half-session of an active session but with inactive data traffic received a normal flow data flow control (DFC) or function management data (FMD) request. An invalid request header or request unit for the receivers current session control or data flow control state was found. Delivery to the half-session component was prevented.  
  
 LUA_DATA_TRAFFIC_QUIESCED  
  
 Secondary return code; a DFC or FMD request was received from a half-session that sent either a SHUTC command or QC command, and the DFC or FMD request has not responded to a RELQ command. An invalid request header or request unit for the receivers current session control or data flow control state was found. Delivery to the half-session component was prevented.  
  
 LUA_DATA_TRAFFIC_NOT_RESET  
  
 Secondary return code; while the data traffic state was not reset, the session control request was received. An invalid request header or request unit for the received current session control or data flow control state was found. Delivery to the half-session component was prevented.  
  
 LUA_NO_BEGIN_BRACKET  
  
 Secondary return code; the receiver has already sent a positive response to a BIS command when a BID or an FMD request specifying BBI=BB was received. An invalid request header or request unit for the received current session control or data flow control state was found. Delivery to the half-session component was prevented.  
  
 LUA_SC_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION  
  
 Secondary return code; a violation of SC protocol occurred. A request (that is permitted only after an SC request and a positive response to that request have been successfully exchanged) was received before the required exchange. Byte 4 of the sense data contains the request code. No user data exists for this sense code. An invalid header request or data flow control state was found. Delivery to the half-session component was prevented.  
  
 LUA_IMMEDIATE_REQUEST_MODE_ERROR  
  
 Secondary return code; the request violated the immediate request mode protocol. An invalid header request or request unit for the received current session control or data flow control state was found. Delivery to the half-session component was prevented.

 Secondary return code; the PDI was incorrectly specified. The BIND options chosen previously or the architectural rules were violated by the request header parameter values. Delivery to the half-session component was prevented. The errors are not dependent on the current session state. The senders failure to enforce session rules may have caused the errors.  
  
 LUA_NO_SESSION  
  
 Secondary return code; a request to activate a session is required because no active half-session in the receiving end node for the origination-destination pair exists, or no active boundary function half-session component for the origination-destination pair in a node that supplies the boundary function exists. Delivery of the request could not take place for one of the following reasons:  
  
 A path information unit error  
  
 A path outage  
  
 An invalid sequence of requests for activation  
  
 If a path error is received during an active session, that usually indicates there is no longer a valid path to the session partner.  
  
 LUA_CANCELED  
 Primary return code; the secondary return code gives the reason for canceling the command.  
  
 LUA_TERMINATED  
  
 Secondary return code; the session was terminated when a verb was pending. The verb process has been canceled.  
  
 LUA_IN_PROGRESS  
 Primary return code; an asynchronous command was received but is not completed.  
  
 LUA_COMM_SUBSYSTEM_ABENDED  
 Primary return code; indicates one of the following conditions:  
  
 The node used by this conversation encountered an ABEND.  
  
 The connection between the transaction program (TP) and the physical unit (PU) 2.1 node has been broken (a LAN error).  
  
 The SnaBase at the TPs computer encountered an ABEND.  
  
 LUA_COMM_SUBSYSTEM_NOT_LOADED  
 Primary return code; a required component could not be loaded or terminated while processing the verb. Thus, communication could not take place. Contact the system administrator for corrective action.  
  
 LUA_INVALID_VERB_SEGMENT  
 Primary return code; the VCB extended beyond the end of the data segment.  
  
 LUA_UNEXPECTED_DOS_ERROR  
 Primary return code; after issuing an operating system call, an unexpected operating system return code was received and is specified in the secondary return code.  
  
 LUA_STACK_TOO_SMALL  
 Primary return code; the stack size of the application is too small to execute the verb. Increase the stack size of your application.  
  
 LUA_INVALID_VERB  
 Primary return code; either the verb code or the operation code, or both, is invalid. The verb did not execute.  
  
## Remarks  
 **SLI_SEND** sends responses, SNA commands, and data from the Windows LUA application to a host LU. A session must already be open to issue **SLI_SEND** for a particular LU-LU session flow. To send data on the SSCP normal flow prior to the completion of [SLI_OPEN](../core/sli-open.md), the session must have been initialized as primary with SSCP access. In addition, the session status must be INIT_COMPLETE.  
  
 The settings for lua_message_type determine the type of processing that will be done by SLI_SEND. The following table indicates the parameters to set based on the value of lua_message_type.  
  
|SLI_SEND parameter|LU_DATA<br /><br /> SSCP_DATA|BID<br /><br /> BIS<br /><br /> RTR|CHASE<br /><br /> QC|LUSTAT_LU<br /><br /> LUSTAT_SSCP|QEC<br /><br /> RELQ<br /><br /> SBI<br /><br /> SIGNAL|RQR|RSP|  
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------|---------|  
|**lua_data**<br />**_length**|Req.|0|0|Req.|0|0|Req. (0 if no data)|  
|**lua_data**<br />**_ptr**|Req. (0 if no data)|0|0|Req.|0|0|Req. (0 if no data)|  
|**lua_flag1 flow flags**|0|0|0|0|0|0|Req. (set one)|  
|**lua_rh**|FI DRL1 DRL2 RI BBI EBI CDI CSI EDI|SDI QRI|SDI QRI EBI CDI|SDI QRI DRL1 DRL2 RI BBI EBI CDI|SDI|0|RRI RI|  
|**lua_th**|0|0|0|0|0|0|SNF|  
  
 The location provided in **lua_data_ptr** and the length provided in **lua_data_length** determine the data that the SLI sends. The data will be chained by the SLI verbs if necessary.  
  
 When sending a response, the type of response determines the SLI_SEND information required. For all responses, you must:  
  
-   Set the selected **lua_flag1** flow flag.  
  
-   Provide the sequence number in lua_th.snf for the request to which you are responding.  
  
-   Set lua_message_type to LUA_MESSAGE_TYPE_RSP.  
  
 For multichain message responses, the sequence number of the last received chain element must be used. For a response to a multichain message ending with a CANCEL command, the CANCEL command sequence number is used.  
  
 For positive responses that only require the request code, set lua_rh.ri to zero (indicating that the response is positive) and lua_data_length to zero (indicating no data is provided). The request code is filled in by the SLI, using the sequence number provided.  
  
 For negative responses in which lua_rh.ri is set to 1, set the lua_data_ptr to the SNA sense code address and the lua_data_length to the SNA sense code length (four bytes). The sequence number is used by the SLI to fill in the request code.
