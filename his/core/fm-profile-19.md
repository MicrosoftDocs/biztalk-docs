# FM Profile 19
Function management (FM) Profile 19 is supported on primary logical unit-secondary logical unit (PLU-SLU) sessions using LU 6.2. This profile specifies the following session rules:  
  
-   PLU and SLU use immediate request mode.  
  
-   PLU and SLU use immediate response mode.  
  
-   Multiple RU chains are allowed.  
  
-   PLU and SLU requests indicate definite or exception response.  
  
-   No compression is used.  
  
-   Brackets are used.  
  
-   FM headers (types 5, 7, and 12 only) are allowed.  
  
-   Conditional termination for brackets, specified by conditional end bracket (CEB),is used.  
  
-   PLU and SLU may send CEB.  
  
-   Normal-flow send/receive mode is half-duplex flip-flop.  
  
-   Half-duplex flip-flop reset state is SEND for PLU.  
  
-   Symmetric error responsibility.  
  
-   Contention winner/loser is negotiated at BIND time.  
  
-   PLU and SLU support the following data flow control (DFC) commands:  
  
    -   **SIGNAL**  
  
    -   **LUSTAT**  
  
    -   **BIS**  
  
    -   **RTR**  
  
-   The following combinations of RQE, RQD, CEB, and CD are allowed on end-chain Russ
