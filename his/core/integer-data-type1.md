# Integer Data Type
Binary Integer data types apply to COBOL COMP and Report Program Generator (RPG) Integer data types. Automation data types support only a 16-bit or 32-bit Integer. Therefore, you should ensure that your client application is passing binary integer equivalents to the Transaction Integrator (TI) Automation server.
