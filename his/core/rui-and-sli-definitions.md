# RUI and SLI Definitions
The definitions of the [RUI](../Topic/RUI1.md) and [SLI](../Topic/SLI1.md) functions are as follows:  
  
```  
void WINAPI RUI(struct LUA_VERB_RECORD FAR * verb);  
void WINAPI SLI(struct LUA_VERB_RECORD FAR * verb);  
int WINAPI WinRUI(HWND handle, struct LUA_VERB_RECORD FAR * verb);  
int WINAPI WinSLI(HWND handle, struct LUA_VERB_RECORD FAR * verb);  
```  
  
 The WINLUA.H header file supplied with your Host Integration Server SDK includes prototypes of these functions.  
  
 The only parameter passed to the **RUI** or **SLI** function is the address of a verb control block (VCB). The VCB is a structure made up of variables that:  
  
-   Identify the logical unit application (LUA) verb to be executed.  
  
-   Supply information used by the verb.  
  
-   Contain information returned by the verb when execution is complete.  
  
 The parameters passed to the [WinRUI](../Topic/WinRUI2.md)or [WinSLI](../Topic/WinSLI2.md) function are a window handle and the address of a VCB. The window handle is used for message notification when the issued verb has completed.  
  
 The VCB structure is declared in the WINLUA.H header file. For general VCB information, see [LUA VCB Format](../core/lua-vcb-format.md). For verb-specific VCB information, see the reference documentation for each verb.
