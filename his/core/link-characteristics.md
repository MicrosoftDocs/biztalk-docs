# Link Characteristics
Before the driver can transfer any data, it needs information about the link. This includes the following:  
  
-   The frame size.  
  
-   The station address to listen on (if required).  
  
-   Details of hardware selectable options, such as SDLC/HDLC, Internal/External clocking, and so on.  
  
 For more details of these options, refer to the topic [Function 0x42: Set Link Characteristics](../Topic/Function%200x42:%20Set%20Link%20Characteristics2.md).
