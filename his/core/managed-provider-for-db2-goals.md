# Managed Provider for DB2 Goals
The main goal of the Managed Provider for DB2 is to enable access to loosely coupled data sources using the technologies offered by ADO.NET and the .NET Framework. To implement this goal, the Managed Provider for DB2 was designed as an incremental improvement over the traditional COM-based OLE DB providers. In addition, the Managed Provider for DB2 is optimized for DB2 over the currently available OLE DB .NET Framework data provider.  
  
## ADO.NET and the .NET Framework  
 To make implementation easier and to improve performance, scalability, and XML support, Microsoft offered the .NET Framework and ADO.NET. The .NET Framework offered developers a number of advantages over COM, such as cross-language inheritance, object lifetime management, and multi-language class libraries as supported by the common language runtime (CLR). The CLR offers developers a predictable, managed environment in which to execute their programs. ADO.NET is a set of common classes for exposing data services that are implemented by .NET Framework data providers.  
  
 Host Integration Server includes a .NET Framework data provider for a key enterprise data source: DB2.
