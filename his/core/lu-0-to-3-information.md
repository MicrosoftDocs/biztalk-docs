# LU 0 to 3 Information
LU 0 to 3 information is provided in the **lu_0_3_info_sect** structure as defined below.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
typedef struct lu_0_3_info_sect {  
    unsigned long  lu_0_3_init_sect_len;  
    unsigned short num_lu_0_3s;  
} LU_0_3_ INFO_SECT;  
```  
  
## Members  
 lu_0_3_init_sect_len  
 The length of the initial LU 0 to 3 information section, including this parameter, up to the first link overlay group. The length does not include any previous information sections.  
  
 num_lu_0_3s  
 The number of LU groups. This is the number of times the lu_0_3 overlay group is repeated.  
  
 For each configured LU, an **lu_0_3_overlay** structure for the LU is provided as defined below.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
typedef struct lu_0_3_overlay {  
    unsigned long  lu_0_3_entry_len;  
    unsigned char  access_type;  
    unsigned char  lu_type;  
    unsigned char  lu_daf;  
    unsigned char  lu_short_name;  
    unsigned char  lu_long_name[8];  
    unsigned char  session_id[8];  
    unsigned long  dlc_name[8];  
    unsigned char  adapter_num;  
    unsigned char  dest_addr_len;  
    unsigned char  dest_addr[32];  
    unsigned char  sscp_lu_sess_state;  
    unsigned char  lu_lu_sess_state;  
    unsigned char  link_id[12];  
 } LU_0_3_OVERLAY;  
```
