# Application Tab (Listener Properties)
The **Application** tab displays the local environment properties that are specific to the application. It allows you to specify whether the application will begin listening on the local environment endpoints automatically when the application is started.  
  
|Use this|To do this|  
|--------------|----------------|  
|**Begin Listening on the local environment at application startup**|When this option is selected, the application will automatically start listening for incoming host requests on each port defined in the local environment.|  
  
> [!CAUTION]
>  The properties of an listener are not intended to be set or changed programmatically. Setting or changing the properties programmatically might cause the application to function incorrectly.
