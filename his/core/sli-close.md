# SLI_CLOSE
The **SLI_CLOSE** verb ends a session opened with [SLI_OPEN](../core/sli-open.md). The LU-LU and LU-SSCP resources are released.  
  
 The following structure describes the LUA_COMMON member of the verb control block (VCB) used by SLI_CLOSE.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
struct LUA_COMMON {  
    unsigned short   lua_verb;  
    unsigned short   lua_verb_length;  
    unsigned short   lua_prim_rc;  
    unsigned long    lua_sec_rc;  
    unsigned short   lua_opcode;  
    unsigned long    lua_correlator;  
    unsigned char    lua_luname[8];  
    unsigned short   lua_extension_list_offset;  
    unsigned short   lua_cobol_offset;  
    unsigned long    lua_sid;  
    unsigned short   lua_max_length;  
    unsigned short   lua_data_length;  
    char FAR *       lua_data_ptr;  
    unsigned long    lua_post_handle;  
    struct LUA_TH    lua_th;

    unsigned char    lua_resv56[7];  
    unsigned char    lua_encr_decr_option;  
  
};  
```  
  
## Members  
 **lua_verb**  
 Supplied parameter. Contains the verb code, LUA_VERB_SLI for Session Level Interface (SLI) verbs.  
  
 **lua_verb_length**  
 Supplied parameter. Specifies the length in bytes of the logical unit application (LUA) VCB. It must contain the length of the verb record being issued.  
  
 **lua_prim_rc**  
 Primary return code set by LUA at the completion of the verb. The valid return codes vary depending on the LUA verb issued.  
  
 **lua_sec_rc**  
 Secondary return code set by LUA at the completion of the verb. The valid return codes vary depending on the LUA verb issued.  
  
 **lua_opcode**  
 Supplied parameter. Contains the LUA command code (verb operation code) for the verb to be issued, LUA_OPCODE_SLI_CLOSE.  
  
 **lua_correlator**  
 Supplied parameter. Contains a user-supplied value that links the verb with other user-supplied information. LUA does not use or change this information. This parameter is optional.  
  
 **lua_luname**  
 Supplied parameter. Specifies the ASCII name of the local LU used by the Windows LUA session.  
  
 SLI_CLOSE only requires this parameter if lua_sid is zero.  
  
 This parameter is eight bytes long, padded on the right with spaces (0x20) if the name is shorter than eight characters.  
  
 **lua_extension_list_offset**  
 Not used by **SLI_CLOSE** and should be set to zero.  
  
 **lua_cobol_offset**  
 Not used by LUA in MicrosoftÂ® Host Integration Server  and should be zero.  
  
 **lua_sid**  
 Supplied parameter. Specifies the session identifier and is returned by [SLI_OPEN](../core/sli-open.md) and [RUI_INIT](../core/rui-init.md). Other verbs use this parameter to identify the session used for the command. If other verbs use the **lua_luname** parameter to identify sessions, set the **lua_sid** parameter to zero.  
  
 **lua_max_length**  
 Not used by **SLI_CLOSE** and should be set to zero.  
  
 **lua_data_length**  
 Not used by **SLI_CLOSE** and should be set to zero.  
  
 **lua_data_ptr**  
 Not used by **SLI_CLOSE** and should be set to zero.  
  
 **lua_post_handle**  
 Supplied parameter. Used under Microsoft Windows Server if asynchronous notification is to be accomplished by events. This variable contains the handle of the event to be signaled or a window handle.  
  
 **lua_th**  
 Not used by **SLI_CLOSE** and should be set to zero.  
  
 **lua_rh**  
 Not used by **SLI_CLOSE** and should be set to zero.  
  
 **lua_flag1**  
 Supplied parameter. Contains a data structure containing flags for messages supplied by the application. Its subparameters are as follows:  
  
 lua_flag1.bid_enable  
  
 Bid enable indicator, one bit.  
  
 lua_flag1.close_abend  
  
 Close immediate indicator, one bit. A supplied parameter used by **SLI_CLOSE** to specify whether the session is to be closed immediately (ON) or closed normally (OFF). For verbs other than **SLI_CLOSE**, this flag must be off.

 System services control point (SSCP) expedited flow, one bit.  
  
 lua_flag1.sscp_norm  
  
 SSCP normal flow, one bit.  
  
 lua_flag1.lu_exp  
  
 LU expedited flow, one bit.  
  
 lua_flag1.lu_norm  
  
 LU normal flow, one bit.  
  
 **lua_message_type**

 LUA_CLOSE_PENDING  
  
 Secondary return code; one of the following has occurred:  
  
-   A CLOSE_ABEND was still pending when another CLOSE_ABEND was issued. You can issue a CLOSE_ABEND if a CLOSE_NORMAL is pending.  
  
-   Either a CLOSE_ABEND or a CLOSE_NORMAL was still pending when a CLOSE_NORMAL was issued.  
  
 LUA_SESSION_FAILURE  
 Primary return code; an error condition, specified in the secondary return code, caused the session to fail.  
  
 LUA_NOT_ACTIVE  
  
 Secondary return code; LUA was not active within Microsoft Host Integration Server  when an LUA verb was issued.

 LUA_COMM_SUBSYSTEM_NOT_LOADED  
 Primary return code; a required component could not be loaded or terminated while processing the verb. Thus, communication could not take place. Contact the system administrator for corrective action.  
  
 LUA_INVALID_VERB_SEGMENT  
 Primary return code; the VCB extended beyond the end of the data segment.

 LUA_INVALID_VERB  
 Primary return code; either the verb code or the operation code, or both, is invalid. The verb did not execute.  
  
## Remarks  
 There are two types of **SLI_CLOSE**: normal and ABEND. For a normal close, **lua_flag1.close_abend** is set to zero. The sequence for a normal close can be initiated either as primary (host-initiated) or secondary (requested by a Windows LUA application). During a primary normal close, the Windows LUA interface:  
  
-   Reads the SHUTD command and posts the SESSION_END_REQUESTED status to the application.  
  
-   Writes the CHASE command (if necessary).  
  
-   Reads and processes the CHASE command response (if necessary).  
  
-   Writes the shutdown complete (SHUTC) command.  
  
-   Reads and processes the SHUTC command response.  
  
-   Reads and processes the CLEAR command (if necessary).  
  
-   Writes the CLEAR command response (if necessary).  
  
-   Reads and processes the UNBIND command.  
  
-   Writes the UNBIND command response.  
  
-   Stops the session.  
  
 During a secondary normal close, the Windows LUA interface:  
  
-   Writes the RSHUTD command.  
  
-   Reads and processes the RSHUTD command response.  
  
-   Reads and processes the CLEAR command (if necessary).  
  
-   Writes the CLEAR command response (if necessary).  
  
-   Reads and processes the UNBIND command.  
  
-   Writes the UNBIND command response.  
  
-   Stops the session.  
  
 For an ABEND close, **lua_flag1.close_abend** is set to 1, which directs the Windows LUA interface to close the session immediately. After **SLI_CLOSE** starts processing, the LU-LU connection is terminated and the SSCP is informed that the LU is not capable of sustaining a session.
