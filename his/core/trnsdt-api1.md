# TrnsDT API
The SNA National Language Support (SNANLS) API also enables applications to convert double-byte character stream (DBCS) EBCDIC-to-ANSI and DBCS ANSI-to-EBCDIC by leveraging another Host Integration Server API called TrnsDT. The TrnsDT API has its own mechanism to translate East Asia code pages using conversion table resource files (*.tbl files) that the Setup program for Host Integration Server installs on the target computer.
