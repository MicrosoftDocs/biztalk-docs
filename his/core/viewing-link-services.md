# Viewing Link Services
As with other link services, you can view IP-DLC link services in the list view of the **Link Services** folder.  
  
### To view link services  
  
1.  In the scope pane of the [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../core/includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] MMC snap-in, locate the computer with the link services that you want to view.  
  
2.  Expand the list for that computer.  
  
3.  Select the **Link Services** folder. The link services for that computer will appear in the right pane.
