# Creating Link Services
By default, when [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../core/includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] is installed, all the software files required by all standard link services are copied to the server, but the link services themselves are not installed or configured.  
  
 For information about the IP-DLC Link Service, see [IP-DLC Link Service](../Topic/IP-DLC%20Link%20Service1.md).  
  
 The following sections contain procedures detailing how to create link services using SNA Manager.
