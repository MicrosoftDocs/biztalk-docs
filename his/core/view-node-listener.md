-   **Refresh**. Redraws the screen to show any updates.  
  
-   **Export List**. Allows you to save the list of views as a separate text or Unicode text file.

    -   **Host environments**

> [!NOTE]
>  When viewed from this node, the property pages are read-only. If you want to change a property, right-click the ***view* Node** under the ***object* Node**, and then left-click **Properties** on the shortcut menu. The properties viewed on those pages can be changed.  
  
-   **Help**. Displays a Help topic (this topic) that explains the items that appear in the TI Manager console and the actions you can take.
