# Export Wizard
The **Export Wizard** is used in exporting an equivalent COBOL/RPG definition for the current component. It is not really a wizard because it does not contain any pages, such as a welcome or a finish page. You can start this wizard by selecting **Export** on the **Library** top-level menu. When you select the menu item, a text window opens under Visual Studio, and the COBOL/RPG is displayed in it. You can then save it, discard it, or add it to the project.
