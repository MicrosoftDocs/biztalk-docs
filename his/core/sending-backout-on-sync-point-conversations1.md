# Sending Backout on Sync Point Conversations
To send a Backout, an FMH-7 containing a sense code of 0x08240000 or 0x08240001 is sent on the session. This is done using the [SEND_ERROR](./send-error2.md) or [MC_SEND_ERROR](./mc-send-error2.md) verb. To enable Host Integration Server to send the appropriate sense data, the **SEND_ERROR** and **MC_SEND_ERROR** verbs are modified as follows:  
  
-   A new field, **err_type**, is added to allow the TP to specify the type of error. The default is AP_PROG (0x00), which means existing TPs will continue to work unmodified.  
  
-   The **err_type** field in both verbs can take one of two new values, specifying the sense codes to be generated by Host Integration Server:  
  
     AP_BACKOUT_NO_RESYNC for sense code 0x08240000  
  
     AP_BACKOUT_RESYNC for sense code 0x08240001
