# How to Connect to and Disconnect from a Host File System
The first step in accessing a host file system is to connect to the file system. You must use `HostFileConnection` to access the host file system. After you have connected, you can retrieve, modify, and update the information that you want.  
  
## Procedure  
  
#### To connect and disconnect to a Host File System  
  
1.  Create a `HostFileConnection` object, using the connection string that describes the Host system.  
  
2.  Open a connection with a call to `HostFileConnection.Open`.  
  
3.  Interact with the host file system as necessary.  
  
4.  When you are finished, release the `HostFileConnection` object with a call to `HostfileConnection.Close` and `HostFileConnection.Dispose`.  
  
     Connections are not implicitly released when a `HostFileConnection` falls out of scope. Therefore, you need to release the object when you are finished using it.  
  
## Example  
 The following very simple code example shows how to use `HostFileConnection` to open and close a connection.  
  
```  
try  
   {  
      HostFileConnection cn = new HostFileConnection();  
      cn.ConnectionString = cnstring;  
      cn.Open();  
      // Perform tasks here.  
      cn.Close();  
      cn.Dispose();  
   }  
```
