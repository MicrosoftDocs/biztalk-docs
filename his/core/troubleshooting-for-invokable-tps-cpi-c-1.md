# Troubleshooting for Invokable TPs (CPI-C)
If there are difficulties with starting an invokable transaction program (TP), there may be a mismatch between the information for the invokable TP, the invoking TP, or logical units (LUs) in the SNA service configuration. That is, there may be a mismatch between the symbolic destination parameters, the registry or environment variables, or LU aliases specified in SNA Manager. For details about how to specify LU aliases in SNA Manager, see [Invoking TPs and SNA Service Configuration](../core/invoking-tps-and-sna-service-configuration-cpi-c-2.md).
