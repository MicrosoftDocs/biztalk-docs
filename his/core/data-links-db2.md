# Data Links (DB2)
Data consumers, such as Visual Studio and SQL Server, use the Data Links dialog to configure connections to IBM DB2 database servers. Data Links can save a data source definition as an OLE DB universal data link (UDL) file, which allows the user to share configurations between applications, users, and computers.  
  
 You can create a data link by clicking the Data Access Tool shortcut in the [!INCLUDE[hishostintegrationserver2009](../core/includes/hishostintegrationserver2009-md.md)] program folder. You can then modify the UDL using the Data Links tool by opening the file from Windows Explorer, which loads the standard OLE DB Data Links user interface.  
  
 To start the Data Access tool, click the Data Access Tool shortcut in the [!INCLUDE[hishostintegrationserver2009](../core/includes/hishostintegrationserver2009-md.md)] program folder or click **Start**, **Programs**, **Microsoft OLE DB Provider for DB2** and then **Data Access Tool**.  
  
 This topic contains the following sections:

-   [Connection](../core/data-links-db2.md#Connection)  
  
-   [Advanced](../core/data-links-db2.md#Advanced)  
  
-   [All](../core/data-links-db2.md#All)  
  
## Provider  
 Use the **Provider** tab to select the **Microsoft OLE DB Provider for DB2** (the provider name string) from a list of possible OLE DB providers.  
  
## Connection  
 Use the **Connection** tab to configure the basic properties required to connect to a data source. This section describes the properties that are specific to Microsoft OLE DB Provider for DB2 connections.  
  
 **Data Source**  
  
 Specify a string to describe the data source. When you create a data link file by using the Data Source Wizard, the Data Source property names the Universal Data Link (UDL) file or connection string file.  
  
 **Network**  
  
 The Data Provider supports TCP/IP and SNA (Systems Network Architecture) over LU6.2 APPC (Advanced Program to Program Communications) network connections to remote IBM DB2 database servers that are running on IBM mainframe and midrange host computers. The Data Provider supports TCP/IP network connections to remote IBM DB2 database servers that are running Linux, UNIX, or Windows operating systems.  
  
 You can select either **APPC Connection** or **TCP/IP Connection** from the drop-down list, when you connect to DB2 databases that are running on host mainframe DB2/MVS and host midrange DB2/400 computers.  
  
 You must select **TCP/IP Connection** from the drop-down list, when connecting to DB2 databases that are running Linux, UNIX, or Windows operating systems.  
  
 **APPC Connection**  
  
 If you select **APPC Connection**, click the ellipses (**…**) to open the dialog box for configuring **APPC Network Settings**.  
  
 You must select or enter the name of the APPC local LU alias, APPC remote LU alias, and APPC mode name configured in Host Integration Server. A common value for DB2/MVS is IBMRDB and DB2/400 is QPCSUPP. Optionally you can specify the APPC conversation security to identify the Data Provider user to the DB2 database server.  
  
 The following table describes security level settings.  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|**Security Level**|**Description**|  
|Program|Data Provider sends both a username and a password.|

 **PC Code Page**  
  
 The Data Provider requires a value for PC Code Page with which to perform code page conversions on string data. The default PC code page is ANSI – Latin I [1252]. Typically, data consumers use either ANSI (American National Standards Institute) or Unicode. For more information, see [SNA Internationalization Programmer's Reference](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=181017) (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=181017).  
  
 **Persist Security Info**  
  
 Optionally, you can specify TRUE to instruct the data consumer or service component to persist security information, such as password, together with other authentication information. By default, this Boolean value is set to FALSE.  
  
 **Principal Name**  
  
 This property is required for use with Kerberos authentication.  
  
 **RowSetCacheSize**  
  
 Optionally, you can specify a numeric value to instruct the Data Provider to pre-fetch rows from IBM DB2 database servers while concurrently processing rows to the data consumer. The default is 0.  
  
 This feature may improve performance in bulk read-only operations on multiprocessor computers. We recommend setting a value of 5 through 200, depending on the average row size, available network bandwidth, IBM DB2 database server and data consumer responsiveness.  
  
 **Units of Work**  
  
 Optionally, to enlist the Data Provider in distributed transactions, select this property to support two-phase commit protected DB2 DUW (distributed unit of work). By default this value is set to RUW (Remote Unit of Work).  
  
 **Use Early Metadata**  
  
 The **Use Early Metadata** property instructs the Data Provider to use early metadata (parameter and column data types) defined at design time or late metadata defined at runtime. This optional property accepts a **Boolean** value. The default value is **false**. Optionally, specify **true** when working with data consumer programs that offer a design time option to derive data types or verify the early metadata. Specify true when using SQL Server Integration Services and Distributed Query Processor four-part linked server queries. Specify true when using DB2 BLOB, CLOB, XML, NUMERIC, and UDT with most other data consumers.  
  
 **User ID**  
  
 Interactive sign-on security relies on a username and password that the user enters at runtime, or that is stored in a configuration file or data consumer configuration store, such as an Integration Services package.  
  
 The following table describes the DB2 database version and accepted string types.  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|**DB2 Database**|**String Type**|  
|DB2 for z/OS|An 8-byte string.|  
|DB2 for i5/OS|A 10-byte string.|  
|DB2 for Linux or UNIX|An 8-byte string.|  
|DB2 for Windows|A 30-byte string Password.|
