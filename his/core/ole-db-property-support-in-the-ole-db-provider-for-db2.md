# OLE DB Property Support in the OLE DB Provider for DB2
OLE DB Provider for DB2 included with [!INCLUDE[hishostintegrationserver2009](../core/includes/hishostintegrationserver2009-md.md)] supports a different set of provider-specific properties than the earlier OLE DB Provider for DB2 supplied with SNA Server 4.0. The sections below provide information about provider-specific and standard OLE DB properties supported by the current and the previous version of OLE DB provider.
