# Host File Designer Views
The Host File Designer development tool uses a two-pane user interface. The left pane displays a tree view, and the right pane displays a list view, or **Details** view. The tree view displays a hierarchical representation of the contents of the library. The list view displays a compact subset of the selected type library component’s properties that are displayed in the property browser. You might find it useful to customize the details view by using something other than a list. For example, a COBOL, RPG, or IDL view might be more useful.  
  
## Tree View  
 The tree view displays a hierarchical view of the components in a type library, also known as a metadata assembly.  
  
 The tree view contains the following elements:  
  
 **Library**  
  
-   Tables  
  
    -   Table1  
  
    -   Table Member1  
  
    -   Table Member2  
  
    -   …  
  
    -   Table Member(n)  
  
    -   Table2  
  
    -   …  
  
    -   Table(n)  
  
-   Schemas  
  
    -   Schema1  
  
    -   Schema Member1  
  
    -   Schema Member2  
  
    -   …  
  
    -   Schema Member(n)  
  
    -   Schema2  
  
    -   …  
  
    -   Schema(n)  
  
-   Unions  
  
    -   Union1  
  
    -   Union Member1  
  
    -   Union Member2.  
  
    -   …  
  
    -   Member(n)  
  
    -   Union2  
  
    -   …  
  
    -   Union(n)  
  
## Details View  
 The details view displays information about the item that is selected in the tree view. The Details view consists of three tabs, each describing the information in the Tree view in a different fashion.  
  
### List Tab  
 The List tab displays a subset of the properties of the selected type library component.  
  
 The detail views include the following:  
  
-   Tables view  
  
-   Table Member view  
  
-   Schemas view  
  
-   Schema view  
  
-   Unions view  
  
-   Union view  
  
-   Union member view  
  
### Definition Tab  
 The Definition tab displays the type library as a .NET interface.
