# TRMOUT
Use the **TRMOUT** keyword to override the default transaction request message (TRM) containing the transaction program ID, user ID, password, and other administrative data sent from the host. The COMTIContext context name is **TRMOUT**. The TRM must be defined as a user-defined type (UDT), and the name of that UDT must begin with the characters TRMOUT.
