# FM Profile 7
Function management (FM) Profile 7 is supported on primary logical unit-secondary logical unit (PLU-SLU) sessions using LU 0. This profile uses the following session rules:  
  
-   PLU and SLU use immediate response mode.  
  
-   PLU and SLU support the following data flow control (DFC) commands (an asterisk [*] indicates commands permitted by the FM profile that are never sent by [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../core/includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)]):  
  
    -   **CANCEL**  
  
    -   **SIGNAL**  
  
    -   **LUSTAT**  
  
    -   **RSHUTD***
