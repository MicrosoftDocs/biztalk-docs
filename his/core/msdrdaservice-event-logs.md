# MsDrdaService Event Logs
The DRDA Server logs events to the Microsoft Windows application and service log named “DrdaService”. IT professionals can view this log using the Microsoft Windows Event Viewer. The DRDA Server logs events to the Event Viewer.  
  
## Event Viewer  
 The Event Viewer is a Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in that enables you to browse and manage event logs. It is an indispensable tool for monitoring the health of systems and troubleshooting issues when they arise.  
  
 Event Viewer enables you to perform the following tasks:  
  
-   View events from multiple event logs  
  
-   Save useful event filters as custom views that can be reused  
  
-   Schedule a task to run in response to an event  
  
-   Create and manage event subscriptions  
  
 The Event Viewer is a Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in. You can start Event Viewer by adding the snap-in to MMC or by double-clicking the snap-in file, Eventvwr.msc, which is located in the %SYSTEMROOT%\system32 folder. In addition, Event Viewer can be started from the Windows interface or the command line by using the following procedures.  
  
 To start Event Viewer by using the Windows interface:  
  
1.  Click the **Start** button.  
  
2.  Click **Control Panel**.  
  
3.  Click **System and Maintenance**.  
  
4.  Click **Administrative Tools**.  
  
5.  Double-click **Event Viewer**.  
  
 To start Event Viewer by using a command line:  
  
1.  Open a command prompt. To open a command prompt, click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Accessories** and then click **Command Prompt**.  
  
2.  Type **eventvwr**.  
  
 The eventvwr.exe command-line tool supports options that determine the computer the snap-in will connect to and the event logs it will display. When connecting to a computer running a previous version of Windows, the tool can be used to start the snap-in and connect to the remote computer, but the additional command-line options are ignored.  
  
 To display additional help for the eventvwr command-line tool, type the following command at a command prompt: **eventvwr /?**.
