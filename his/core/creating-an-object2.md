# Creating an Object
Objects in the Windows-initiated processing (WIP) environment represent the “Servers” that can be called by a client. As a result of this call, a request is sent to a host. The Object is defined by a Transaction Integrator Metadata file that is generated by the development-time tool (Application Integrator Designer).  
  
 You can use the **Object Wizard** to create new objects.
