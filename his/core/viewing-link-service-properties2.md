# Viewing Link Service Properties
As with other link services, you can view IP-DLC link service properties by using the context menu in the list view of the **Link Services** folder.  
  
### To view link service properties  
  
1. In the scope pane of the [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] MMC snap-in, locate the computer with the link services that you want to view.  
  
2. Expand the list for that computer.  
  
3. Select the **Link Services** folder.  
  
    The link services for that computer appear in the right pane.  
  
4. Right-click the appropriate link service, and then click **Properties**. The **Link Service Properties** page appears.  
  
5. Click **Configure**.  
  
    The properties for this IP-DLC link service appear, and can be viewed or edited.
