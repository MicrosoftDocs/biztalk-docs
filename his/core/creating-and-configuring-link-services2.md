# Creating and Configuring Link Services
By default, when [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] is installed, all the software files required by all standard link services are copied to the server, but the link services themselves are not installed or configured.  
  
 For information about the IP-DLC Link Service, see [IP-DLC Link Service](./ip-dlc-link-service2.md).  
  
 The following procedures detail how to create link services using SNA Manager:  
  
- [How to Create the 3270 Demonstration](../core/how-to-create-the-3270-demonstration1.md)  
  
- [How to Create the 5250 Demonstration](../core/how-to-create-the-5250-demonstration2.md)  
  
- [How to Create the LU1 Print Demonstration](../core/how-to-create-the-lu1-print-demonstration2.md)  
  
- [How to Create the LU3 Print Demonstration](../core/how-to-create-the-lu3-print-demonstration2.md)  
  
  The following procedures detail how to configure link services using SNA Manager:  
  
- [How to Configure the 3270 Demonstration](../core/how-to-configure-the-3270-demonstration2.md)
