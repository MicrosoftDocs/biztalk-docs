# Creating a Local Environment
A local environment (LE) is a set of end points that the host-initiated processing (HIP) runtime uses to listen for incoming requests from the host. If communication with the host uses the TCP/IP network protocol, the endpoints are either port numbers or service names. If communication with the host uses the SNA network protocol, the endpoint is the local logical unit (LU) alias.  
  
 Use the **New Local Environment Wizard** to create a new local environment.
