# LUA Verb Control Blocks
When an application issues a Microsoft® Windows® logical unit application (LUA) verb, the verb is coded within the application as a precisely defined verb control block (VCB). The total length of this VCB is variable and is defined by **lua_verb_length**.  
  
 This section defines the structure of individual Windows LUA VCBs.
