# Add New Item Dialog Box (Host File Designer)
The Add New Item dialog box enables you to add a host file object the currently selected project. There are two panes in the dialog box:  
  
-   The **Categories** pane lists the project item hierarchy.  
  
     For Host File Designer, the only item in this pane is **Host Integration Project Items**.  
  
-   The **Templates** pane lists the related project item types.  
  
     For Host File Designer, the only usable item in this pane is **Host Files Library**. A host files library is a .NET assembly that describes the host file system to your application.  
  
 **To add a new item**  
  
1.  On the **Project** menu, click **Add Host File Library** or **Add New Itemâ€¦**.  
  
     For the purposes of a Host File Designer project, you can add only a Host File Library.  
  
2.  On the **Add New Item** dialog box, confirm that **Host File Library** is highlighted.  
  
3.  Next to **Name**, type the name that you want to use for the library.  
  
4.  Click **Add**, and follow the directions for the relevant Wizard.
