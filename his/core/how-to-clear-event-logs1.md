2.  Point to **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Event Viewer**.  
  
3.  Select the appropriate log file (**Application**, **Security**, **System**, **Directory Service**, or **File Replication Service**).  
  
4.  Click the **Action** menu, and then click **Clear all Events**.  
  
5.  You will be prompted to save the file.
