# How to Add New Users
Although [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] uses the User accounts of the Windows Active Directory directory service, users must be configured to use [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] resources such as LUs.  
  
### To add new users  
  
1.  In SNA Manager, expand the SNA subdomain where the users reside.  
  
2.  Right-click **Configured Users**, point to **New**, and then click **User**.  
  
3.  Select a user (or group) from the list, and click **OK**.
