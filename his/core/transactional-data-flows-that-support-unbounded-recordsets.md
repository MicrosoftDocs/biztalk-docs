# Transactional Data Flows That Support Unbounded Recordsets
This model supports one or more consecutive sends followed by one or more consecutive receives. Therefore, the last input parameter and/or the return value of the method invocation can be an unbounded recordset (that is, a recordset with no set number of rows).  
  
 The CICS Link programming model cannot be used, so this data flow model supports only these two server models:  
  
-   CICS LU6.2 User Data  
  
-   IMS LU6.2
