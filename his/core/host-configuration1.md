# Host configuration

For a connection to be established successfully between a host computer and a [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] computer, a number of software configuration settings (VTAM, NCP, or IBM i), and hardware characteristics must work together. These include the mainframe node ID settings, IBM i name settings, addresses, BTU length, and link service settings.

## Important configuration items

Host configuration settings (VTAM, NCP, or IBM i settings) must match the **Connection and Server** settings on [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)].

- **Mainframe Node ID settings**

  For most mainframes, IDBLK and IDNUM in the PU definition must be matched by the two parts of the Remote Node ID on the Host Integration Server connection.

- **IBM i name settings**

  For the IBM i, local and remote Control Point Names (CP names) and network names must match corresponding Host Integration Server settings (local names configured on the server and remote names on the connection).

- **BTU length**

  For the mainframe, this is set through MAXDATA in the PU definition. For the IBM i, this is set through MAXFRAME. These should equal the Max BTU Length on the Host Integration Server connection.

When you configure a new host connection or troubleshoot an existing connection, regardless of the connection type, the identifiers between the host and Host Integration Server must match. The following sections describe various configuration settings.
