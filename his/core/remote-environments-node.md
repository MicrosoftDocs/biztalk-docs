# Remote Environments Node
Use the **Remote Environments** node to manager remote environments. A remote environment defines the characteristics of the non-Windows host environment that receives requests from Windows-initiated processing (WIP) components.  
  
 Double-click the **Remote Environments** node to expand the node. The right pane displays the following information about the node:  
  
-   **Remote Environment**. The names of the remote environment.  
  
-   **Type**. The type of remote environment.  
  
-   **Comment**. Additional information about the remote environment.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  If you view the list in the right pane of TI Manager and change the order of the columns using the **Add/Remove Columns** command on the shortcut menu, the order of the column headings might not be correct after you close and re-open TI Manager. The next time you open TI Manager, the values in the columns are displayed in the new order you set, but the column headings are in the their default order.  
  
 If you observe that the column headings are no longer in the order you set:  
  
1.  Right-click the node, point to **View**, and then click **Add/Remove Columns**.  
  
2.  On the **Add/Remove Columns** dialog box, click **Restore Defaults**.  
  
3.  Click a different node, then click the node you were just working on.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  The columns should now be in their original order.  
  
 Right-click the **Remote Environments** node to display the following five options:  
  
-   **New**. Displays the following menu items:  
  
    -   **Remote Environment**. Launches the **New Remote Environment Wizard**.
