# Link Service Failure
When the server running a link service fails, the local node is informed of this. It treats the problem as a link outage with outage code 0x0D. This is reported to any active 3270 emulation sessions as a communications check code (â€“+z_nnn). The local node will attempt periodically to reconnect to the link service.
