# Managed Provider for DB2 with Visual Studio
You can create a project that uses the managed provider for DB2 with Visual Studio as you would any other project. The following topics describe any issues that are unique to this provider.  
  
## Data Design Tools  
 The Make Table option in the Visual Studio Query Designer is not supported for the Managed Provider for DB2 in conjunction with IBM DB2 databases. Therefore, the syntax generated by the SELECT INTO statement in Visual Studio is not supported by DB2 when executed using dynamic SQL. There is no solution for this problem.
