# Programming Techniques for LUA Pools
When working with a logical unit application (LUA) LU pool, specify the pool name at the beginning of the conversation and then use the **lua_sid** member (not the pool name) with subsequent calls. This is necessary because the **lua_sid** member is a unique identifier, but the pool name is not, because a pool is designed to supply LUs for multiple conversations.  
  
 When using [RUI_INIT](./rui-init1.md) or [SLI_OPEN](../core/sli-open2.md) with an LUA pool, specify the pool name with the **lua_luname** member. For subsequent calls in the same conversation, use the **lua_sid** member returned from **RUI_INIT** or **SLI_OPEN** to specify the conversation.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  On completion of RUI_INIT or SLI_OPEN, the lua_luname member contains the actual name of the LU used. This allows you to create code for a display for the user, showing the actual LU name used in a particular conversation.
