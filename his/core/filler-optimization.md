# FILLER Optimization
The Transaction Integrator (TI) run-time environment optimizes buffers sent to the host by not sending the bytes corresponding to FILLER that appear at the end of the input data declaration.  
  
 In a CICS LU 6.2 environment, use both the MAXLENGTH and NOTRUNCATE options on the RECEIVE statement when the TI run-time environment receives an input area that contains FILLER as the last data item description. However, this requirement does not apply to CICS LINK and IMS transaction programs.
