# Column Collection Parsing
The following describes the column collection parsing for the Managed Provider for Host Files and provides a sample parsed column collection.  
  
1.  Check for `* OR`  
  
2.  Check for column identifiers separated by commas.  
  
3.  After every column name, check whether the `AS` keyword is provided.  
  
     If `AS` is provided, the next token should be the CLR data type, such as  `Int32` or `String`).  
  
## Example  
 The following is a sample parsed column collection for the Managed Provider for Host Files.  
  
```  
*  
Col1, Col2, …  
Col1 AS String, Col2 as Int32, …  
Col1 AS String, Col2, Col3, …  
```
