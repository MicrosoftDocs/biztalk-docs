# Writing CPI-C Applications
A processing task accomplished by programs using Common Programming Interface for Communications (CPI-C) is called a transaction. Consequently, programs that use CPI-C are called transaction programs (TPs). These programs communicate as peers, on an equal (rather than hierarchical) basis. The TPs use CPI-C calls to exchange status information and application data. Each TP uses CPI-C calls to supply parameters to CPI-C, which performs the preferred function and returns parameters to the TP.  
  
 TPs distributed across a local or wide area network perform distributed transaction processing.  
  
 This section describes how to write transaction programs using CPI-C and how to configure the systems on which TPs run. The topics in this section cover the following general areas:  
  
-   Understanding fundamental concepts related to TPs.  
  
-   Designing and coding TPs.  
  
-   Configuring registry and environment variables for invokable TPs.  
  
-   Configuring MicrosoftÂ® Host Integration Server to work with your TPs.
