# Excel
Excel is a spreadsheet program in the Microsoft Office system. You can use Excel to create and format workbooks (a collection of spreadsheets) in order to analyze data and make more informed business decisions. You can use Excel to track data, build models for analyzing data, write formulas to perform calculations on that data, pivot the data in numerous ways, and present data in a variety of professional looking charts.  
  
 Excel 2010 introduces many new features and improvements, such as slicers that allow you to interactively filter your data, and enhancements to existing features such as pivot tables. In addition, the Excel and the SQL Server teams have collaborated to create a PowerPivot, a powerful data analysis tool made up of two components: an add-in for Excel 2010 and a series of new features for SharePoint 2010. For more information, see [Business Intelligence Features in Excel 2010](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=198250) (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=198250).
