# TN3270 and Single Sign-On
The TN3270 service does not work with Single Sign-On. You should not enable the TN3270 service to run under a user account for which you have a Single Sign-On mapping. If you access the host through the TN3270 service by typing **MS$SAME** for your logon, you will get the user ID and password of the user under which the TN3270 service is running (for example, SNAUSER). If you use an Administrator-level account and change the password, SNA services will fail to start after the password change.
