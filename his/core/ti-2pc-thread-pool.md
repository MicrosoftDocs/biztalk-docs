# TI 2PC Thread Pool
The Transaction Integrator (TI) two-phase commit (2PC) thread pool is different from the COM+ user thread pool. The TI 2PC thread pool is used only for 2PC transactions. The threads are precreated, and a single process interacts with Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (DTC) to handle `prepare` and `commit` transactions. This improves the performance by eliminating thread creation and destruction for every 2PC transaction.  
  
## Default Maximum Thread Settings  
 You do not have to worry about overburdening this pool unless large numbers of 2PC transactions are processed. Only when `prepare` or `commit` times for the transactions become very long can queuing to interact with DTC occur.  
  
-   Default maximum threads for each CPU is 20.  
  
-   Default maximum active threads for each CPU is 19.  
  
-   Default maximum total threads for each system is 80.  
  
 You can adjust the default amounts by adding a TEXT string value to the registry location:  
  
 **HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Cedar\Defaults\Threads**  
  
-   IOPortPoolFactor=20  
  
-   IOPortActive=19  
  
-   ThreadPoolMax=80  
  
### Rules for Specifying Values  
 The following rules apply for specifying values:  
  
-   All values must be greater than zero.  
  
-   IOPortPoolFactor must be >= IOPortActive + 1.  
  
-   ThreadPoolMax must be >= IOPortPoolFactor.  
  
> [!CAUTION]
>  Allocating too many threads can cause Windows to run out of resources, and that can cause unpredictable behavior in COM+ and in Windows.
