# Protect the TI Runtime and Host Environments from Data Overflows
To prevent an attacker from using inbound, unbounded recordsets to launch a denial of service attack on either the Transaction Integrator (TI) runtime or host environment, you should:  
  
-   Store all TI component type libraries and .NET assemblies in a secure directory.  
  
-   Confirm that the access permissions on all type libraries and .NET assemblies are set correctly.  
  
-   Confirm that the access permissions on the directory where the type libraries and .NET assemblies are stored are set correctly.
