# Assigning LUs to an IP Address (TN3270)
In the same way that you assign 3270 LUs to a user or workstation, you can restrict access to LUA LUs or pools by specifying an IP address or subnet mask for clients that must access the resource. If a workstation has a name that can be resolved using name resolution services like DHCP or WINS, the name can be associated with the resource instead.  
  
 Restricting access to clients with specific IP addresses or workstation names increases the security of the LUA resources.
