# BizTalk Adapter for WebSphere MQ
The Client-Based BizTalk Adapter for WebSphere MQ (MQSC Adapter) is a connectivity solution that enables you to use BizTalk Server in an enterprise with WebSphere MQ as the chosen messaging standard.  
  
 Previously, once-and-only-once delivery of messages between BizTalk Server and WebSphere MQ applications was provided by the Server-Based BizTalk Adapter for WebSphere MQ, which requires MQSeries Server on Windows as an intermediate server between BizTalk Server and non-Windows Queue Managers. To enable once-and-only-once delivery of messages, BizTalk Server and the adapter require WebSphere MQ to participate in a distributed transaction using MSDTC (Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator). MSDTC support has been available only with the Server version of WebSphere MQ on Windows.  
  
 With BizTalk Server, transactional messaging (once-and-only-once delivery) is also available through the MQSC Adapter. This is made possible by the MQSC Adapter working together with the WebSphere MQ Extended Transactional Client (MQ Extended-Client). Like the MQSeries Server, the MQ Extended Client supports distributed transactions using Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC) on Windows. Therefore, the adapter can guarantee once-and-only-once delivery of messages by ensuring that both BizTalk Server and MQ Extended-Client participate in a distributed transaction.  
  
 When receiving messages from MQSeries and submitting them to BizTalk Server, the adapter starts an MSDTC transaction and performs an MQGet with SYNCPOINT so that MQSeries participates in the transaction. The adapter passes this same transaction context to BizTalk Server so that BizTalk Server participates in the same transaction when the adapter submits the message to it. After the message has been submitted, the adapter commits the transaction. When sending messages from BizTalk Server to MQSeries, the adapter starts the transaction and performs an MQPut operation with the SYNCPOINT option. BizTalk Server uses this same transaction to remove the message from the BizTalk Server MessageBox database, after which the adapter commits the transaction.  
  
 You can also configure the MQSC Adapter to support non-transactional messaging when integrating with MQSeries Queues. For this, the MQSC Adapter uses the WebSphere MQ Base-Client. In this case, the adapter only guarantees that no messages are lost. Duplication of messages can occur under failure conditions. Therefore, you should use this configuration option only if the application that is consuming the message from BizTalk Server or MQSeries Queues can handle duplication of messages. To prevent loss of messages, the MQSC adapter first does an MQGET with a browse lock by setting the MQGMO_BROWSE_FIRST and MQGMO_LOCK options. The adapter then submits the message to BizTalk Server. If the submitted message to BizTalk Server is successful, the adapter does a destructive MQGet with MQGMO_MSG_UNDER_CURSOR option. If a failure occurs while submitting the message to BizTalk Server, the adapter does an MQGet with MQGMO_UNLOCK so that additional operations can be performed on the message.  
  
 Both the Server-Based BizTalk Adapter for WebSphere MQ and the Client-Based BizTalk Adapter for WebSphere MQ offer their own advantages. The Client-Based Adapter was not designed to replace the Server-Based Adapter. Instead, it provides an additional option for integration between BizTalk Server and WebSphere MQ.  
  
 The following table compares the client-based MQSC adapter with the server-based MQSeries adapter.
