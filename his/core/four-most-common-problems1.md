# Four Most Common Problems
The four most common problems reported are as follows:

1. **Setup or Upgrades**: The most frequently asked [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] questions are related to setup or upgrade issues. Examples of VTAM configurations for connecting to a mainframe can be found in the [Host Configuration](../core/host-configuration1.md) section. The configuration file (COM.CFG) contains almost all of the configuration information for the Host Integration Server environment. It is extremely important to back up this file before making changes.

2. **Connectivity Issues**: If you are having a problem connecting to the host, determine where the problem originates. Because [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] is the middle piece of a three-part connection, it helps to narrow the problem down to a Host Integration client, Host Integration Server issue, or a Host Integration Server host issue.

3. **Host Printing**: For more information, see [Host Print Service Problems](../core/host-print-service-problems1.md).

4. **APPC or LUA Application Failures**: See [APPC or LUA Application Failures](../core/appc-or-lua-application-failures2.md).
