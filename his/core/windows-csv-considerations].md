# Windows CSV Considerations]
The following Microsoft速 Windows速 extensions are of particular importance and should be reviewed before using Windows CSV:  
  
 [WinAsyncCSV](../Topic/WinAsyncCSV2.md)  
 Provides an asynchronous entry point for [TRANSFER_MS_DATA](../Topic/TRANSFER_MS_DATA1.md) only. If used for any other verb, the behavior will be synchronous. Use this extension instead of the blocking version of the verb if you run your application under Microsoft速 Windows速 version 3.*x*.  
  
 When the asynchronous operation is complete, the application's window *hWnd* receives the message returned by **RegisterWindowMessage** with "WinAsyncCSV" as the input string. The *wParam* argument contains the asynchronous task handle returned by the original function call. The *lParam* argument contains the original verb control block (VCB) pointer and can be dereferenced to determine the final return code.  
  
 If the function returns successfully, a "WinAsyncCSV" message is posted to the application when the operation completes or the conversation is canceled.  
  
 [WinCSVCleanup](../Topic/WinCSVCleanup2.md)  
 Terminates and deregisters an application from a Windows CSV implementation.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  An application must call this function to deregister itself from the Windows CSV implementation.  
  
 [WinCSVStartup](../Topic/WinCSVStartup2.md)  
 Allows an application to specify the version of Windows CSV required and to retrieve details of the specific CSV implementation.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  An application must call this function to register itself with a Windows CSV implementation before issuing any further Windows CSV calls.
