# Obtaining Schema Information from the Host File System
You can obtain schema information from a database by using *schema discovery*. Schema discovery enables applications to request that managed providers find and return information about the database schema, also known as *metadata*, of a given database. Different database schema elements such as tables, columns, and stored procedures are exposed through schema collections. Each schema collection contains a variety of schema information specific to the provider that is being used.  
  
 The Managed Provider for Host Files implements `HostFileConnection.GetSchema` class, and the schema information that is returned from `GetSchema` comes in the form of a `DataTable` object. `GetSchema` also provides optional parameters for specifying the schema collection to return, and restricting the amount of information returned.
