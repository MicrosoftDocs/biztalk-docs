# Welcome to the Import COBOL Wizard
The Import Host Definition Wizard supports both COBOL and RPG. You can use the Import wizard to help you select a COBOL copy book or RPG data declaration and use it for designing the component in the designer. To start this wizard, select **Import Host Definition** on the **Library** top-level menu.  
  
 This is a rather complex wizard because there are multiple options and paths to follow. It is a multiple-page wizard that contains **Welcome** and **Finish** pages.
