# LUA SLI Verbs
This section describes the Microsoft® Windows® logical unit application (LUA) Session Level Interface (SLI) verbs. It provides the following information for each SLI verb:  
  
-   Details of the LUA verb control block (VCB) structure.  
  
-   A description of the verb and its purpose.  
  
-   Parameters (VCB structure members) supplied to and returned by LUA. The description of each parameter includes information about the valid values for that parameter.  
  
-   Interaction with other verbs.  
  
 Cryptography is not defined as part of the Windows LUA standard.  
  
 The verb descriptions in this section include parameter values specific to each verb. For a complete description of the VCB structure for both Request Unit Interface (RUI) and SLI verbs, see [LUA Verb Control Blocks](../core/lua-verb-control-blocks.md).
