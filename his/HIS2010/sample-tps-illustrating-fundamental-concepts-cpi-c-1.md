# Sample TPs Illustrating Fundamental Concepts (CPI-C)
A set of sample transaction programs (TPs) is provided on the [!INCLUDE[hishostintegrationserver2009](../includes/hishostintegrationserver2009-md.md)] CD in the \SDK\Samples\SNA subdirectory. Included with the sample code is TPSETUP, a program that simplifies the setting of registry or environment variables needed by autostarted invokable TPs. Without an interface like that provided by TPSETUP, configuring such variables can be complicated and error-prone. Therefore, it is recommended that you use code like TPSETUP in installation programs for autostarted invokable TPs.  
  
 For information about TPSETUP and about the sample TPs, see [CPI-C Samples](../HIS2010/cpi-c-samples.md).
