# Alerts by Application or Service
This option displays an aggregate view of all the alerts generated for a specified set of applications over a specified time. Selecting a specific service displays a report that lists the alerts for that specific service. You can export the list of alerts as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.  
  
### To view charts and lists of alerts by application or service  
  
1.  Open the [Portal Reports Page](../esb-toolkit/portal-reports-page.md).  
  
2.  Click the **Select Applications** link above the first chart, and then select or clear the check boxes in the list of installed Microsoft BizTalk Server applications that appears. You can also use the links that appear to select all or none of the applications. Click **Save** to show the information for the selected applications, or click **Cancel** to abandon your changes.  
  
3.  To change the period for which the charts display information, select **Hour, Day, Week, Month, Quarter, Year,** or **ALL** in the drop-down list above the first chart.  
  
4.  Select an application; the chart changes to show alerts for each of the services within that application.  
  
5.  Select a service in the chart; the page displays a table that lists the alerts for that service.  
  
6.  Click **Export To Excel** to download the list of alerts in a format that you can view in Microsoft Excel.
