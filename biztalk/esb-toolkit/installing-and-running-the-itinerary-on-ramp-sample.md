# Installing and Running the Itinerary On-Ramp Sample
The Itinerary On-Ramp sample demonstrates how you can configure the ESB itinerary properties and run one-way and request-response messaging scenarios, such as the following:  

- Executing an itinerary that uses messaging services  

- Executing an itinerary that uses orchestrations  

- Executing a combination of itinerary steps that use messaging services and orchestrations  

  The Itinerary On-Ramp sample uses a Windows Forms test client application to execute the methods of the Itinerary Web service and display returned messages. You can open the test client project to run it and to examine the code to see how you can use the Itinerary Web service in your own service-oriented architecture (SOA) and ESB applications.
