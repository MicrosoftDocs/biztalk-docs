# Running the Scatter-Gather Sample
The Scatter-Gather sample uses a the Windows Forms test client application provided with the Itinerary On-Ramp sample to demonstrate how this pattern applies the features of the Itinerary service.  
  
 **To run the Scatter-Gather sample**  
  
1. If the GlobalBank.ESB application is not already running, use the Microsoft BizTalk Administration Console to start it.  
  
2. In Windows Explorer, open the folder \Source\Samples\Itinerary\Source\ESB.Itinerary.Test where you installed the [!INCLUDE[esbToolkit](../includes/esbtoolkit-md.md)] samples, and then start the application named Esb.Itinerary.Test.exe.  
  
3. Click the **LoadItinerary** button, and then select the sample itinerary named ScatterGatherItinerary.xml from the \Source\Samples\ScatterGather\Itineraries folder.  
  
4. Clear the **Is Request Response** check box so the application will perform a one-way itinerary services operation.  
  
5. (Optional) Set the **Use WCF Service** check box if you want the application to use the OnRamp.Itinerary.Response.WCF receive location instead of the default OnRamp.Itinerary.Response.SOAP receive location.  
  
6. Click the **LoadMessage** button, and then select the NAOrderDoc.xml sample message from the \Source\Samples\Itinerary\Test\Data folder.  
  
7. Click the **SubmitRequest** button to send the request to the Itinerary On-Ramp service. Open the folder \Source\Samples\DynamicResolution\Test\FileDrop\Out to see the response message.  
  
   For information about how the Scatter Gather sample uses the ESB Itinerary service, see [How the Scatter-Gather Sample Works](../esb-toolkit/how-the-scatter-gather-sample-works.md).
