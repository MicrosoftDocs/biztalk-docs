# Running the JMS MQRFH2 Component Sample
The JMS MQRFH2 Component sample consists of three parts:  
  
-   [Running the JMS MQRFH2 Header Preservation Sample](../esb-toolkit/running-the-jms-mqrfh2-header-preservation-sample.md). This part demonstrates full-fidelity header preservation as a message travels from IBM WebSphere MQ, through ESB and Microsoft BizTalk Server, and back to IBM WebSphere MQ.  
  
-   [Running the Header Property Access from an Orchestration Sample](../esb-toolkit/running-the-header-property-access-from-an-orchestration-sample.md). This part demonstrates how code within an ESB orchestration can access MQRFH2 header properties. In this case, the code uses a header property to specify the destination queue name.  
  
-   [Running the Bulk Load Content-Based Routing Sample](../esb-toolkit/running-the-bulk-load-content-based-routing-sample.md). This part demonstrates bulk loading a queue with messages, and it shows how the application routes messages to the destination queues specified as part of the message content.
