# Portal Registry Pages
When you move the mouse over the **Registry** tab, a pop-up menu provides a list of the following portal registry tasks:  
  
-   [New Registry Entry Page](../esb-toolkit/new-registry-entry-page.md). This menu item opens a page where you can view a list of the existing endpoints in a specified Microsoft BizTalk Server ESB application. A link in the row for each available endpoint opens the [Registry Details Page](../esb-toolkit/registry-details-page.md) where you can edit registry details or create a new Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI) publishing request for the currently configured UDDI server.  
  
-   [Manage Pending Requests Page](../esb-toolkit/manage-pending-requests-page.md). This menu item opens a page that lists all pending UDDI registry registration requests and allows you to manage these requests. You can also view a history of previous requests and their status.
