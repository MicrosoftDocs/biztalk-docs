# AmberPoint BizTalk Nano Agent
AmberPoint SOA Management System (SMS) delivers a comprehensive suite of visualization and analytical tools to address the challenges of run-time governance. The [!INCLUDE[esbToolkit](../includes/esbtoolkit-md.md)] and Microsoft BizTalk Server make integrating SOA business applications and services easier, but analysis of the resulting composite applications and orchestrations is more challenging. AmberPoint's BizTalk Server integration through their BizTalk Nano Agent extends existing run-time governance capabilities to include BizTalk Server receive locations and send ports, regardless of their underlying adapter binding.
