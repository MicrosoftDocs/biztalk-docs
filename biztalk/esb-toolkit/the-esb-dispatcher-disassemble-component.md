# The ESB Dispatcher Disassemble Component
The ESB Dispatcher Disassemble component can dynamically set endpoint location properties for outbound messages in a similar way to the Dispatcher component. This pipeline component combines Microsoft BizTalk message de-batching functionality (by inheriting from the XML disassembler class named **XmlDasmComp**) with the message dispatching mechanism that can execute ESB itinerary messaging services in a BizTalk pipeline.
