# Running the Dynamic Resolution Sample
To execute one of the use case examples, you import the appropriate Microsoft BizTalk binding file into the GlobalBank.ESB BizTalk application and then either drop a suitable message into the sample input folder or call the sample Web service. The Dynamic Resolution sample supports two main scenarios:  
  
- [One-Way Messaging Scenarios for the Dynamic Resolution Sample](../esb-toolkit/one-way-messaging-scenarios-for-the-dynamic-resolution-sample.md). The Dynamic Resolution sample supports this scenario using a file drop folder as the publication point into Microsoft BizTalk.  
  
- [Two-Way Messaging Scenarios for the Dynamic Resolution Sample](../esb-toolkit/two-way-messaging-scenarios-for-the-dynamic-resolution-sample.md). The Dynamic Resolution sample supports this scenario using the NorthAmerican Web service located at http://localhost/ESB.NorthAmericanServices/CustomerOrder.asmx as the publication point into BizTalk.  
  
  To understand how the sample uses the ESB Dispatcher and ESB Dispatcher Disassembler pipeline components, see [How the Dynamic Resolution Sample Works](../esb-toolkit/how-the-dynamic-resolution-sample-works.md).
