# How to: Select an Itinerary Using a Business Rules Policy
## Goal  
 This section demonstrates how to create business rules that can be used to select an itinerary based on the content of a received message and how to configure the Itinerary Selector pipeline component within a generic itinerary on-ramp to call these rules. This section describes a business scenario in which messages are routed differently, based on the region in which the customer resides.  
  
 In this How-to topic, you will complete the following steps:  
  
-   Model itineraries for the Western and Eastern divisions of customer Global Bank.  
  
-   Create business rules policies that will be used to select an itinerary for processing request.  
  
-   Configure the Itinerary Selector pipeline component to use a business rules policy to select the appropriate itinerary.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 The procedures in this How-to topic require the completion of the [Prerequisites for the Development Activities](../esb-toolkit/prerequisites-for-the-development-activities.md).  
  
## Before You Begin  
 Complete the following tasks before you perform the steps later in this How-to topic:  
  
-   Create the GlobalBank West test message.  
  
-   Create the GlobalBank East test message.  
  
 The following procedures describe how to do each of these.  
  
#### To create the GlobalBank West test message  
  
1.  In Windows Explorer, browse to C:\HowTos.  
  
2.  Create a copy of NAOrderDoc.xml, and then name the copy West.xml.  
  
3.  In Notepad, open West.xml, and then change the value of the **customerName** element to **GlobalBankWest**.  
  
4.  Save West.xml as UTF-8, and then close Notepad.  
  
#### To create the GlobalBank East test message  
  
1.  In Windows Explorer, browse to C:\HowTos.  
  
2.  Create a copy of NAOrderDoc.xml, and then name the copy East.xml.  
  
3.  In Notepad, open East.xml, and then change the value of the **customerName** element to **GlobalBankEast**.  
  
4.  Save East.xml as UTF-8, and then close Notepad.  
  
## Steps  
  
#### To create a Business Rules Engine (BRE) policy to select an itinerary using custom message properties  
  
1.  Click **Start** on the taskbar, point to **All Programs**, point to **[!INCLUDE[prague](../includes/prague-md.md)]**, and then click **Business Rule Composer**.  
  
2.  In Policy Explorer, right-click **Policies**, and then click **Add New Policy**. Name the policy **ResolveItineraryBasedOnCustomer**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  This How-to topic uses the same business rules policy and itineraries as those created in the topic [How to: Split an Interchange and Route the Resulting Messages to Multiple File Locations Using Distinct Itineraries](../esb-toolkit/split-an-interchange-and-route-messages-to-multiple-locations-using-itineraries.md). If you have already completed that section, you can skip to the procedure, "To create and configure an ESB on-ramp" later in this topic.  
  
#### To add a selection rule for customer GlobalBank West  
  
1.  In the **ResolveItineraryBasedOnCustomer** policy, right-click **Version 1.0 (not saved)**, and then click **Add New Rule**. Name the rule **SetGlobalBankWestItinerary**.  
  
2.  In Facts Explorer, click the **XML Schemas** tab, right-click **Schemas**, and then click **Browse**.  
  
3.  In the **Schema Files** dialog box, browse to C:\Projects\Microsoft.Practices.ESB\Source\Samples\DynamicResolution\Source\ESB.DynamicResolution.Schemas, select **NAOrderDoc.xsd**, and then click **Open**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  This is the schema that defines the NAOrderDoc.xml message, which was used to create the West and East messages you will use for testing.  
  
4.  In Facts Explorer, click **NAOrderDoc.xsd**, click the **Document Type** property in the Properties pane, and then type **GlobalBank.ESB.DynamicResolution.Schemas.NAOrderDoc**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  This is the fully qualified name of the schema.  
  
5.  In Facts Explorer, expand **NAOrderDoc.xsd**, and then expand **OrderDoc**.  
  
6.  In the Rule window, right-click **Conditions**, point to **Predicates**, and then click **Equal**.  
  
7.  From Facts Explorer, drag the **customerName** element to the **argument1** node under **Conditions**.  
  
8.  Click the **argument2** node, and then type **GlobalBankWest**.  
  
9. In Facts Explorer, click the **Vocabularies** tab. Expand the **ESB.Itinerary** vocabulary, expand **Version 1.1**, and then drag the **Set Itinerary Name** definition to **Actions**.  
  
10. Click **\<empty string\>**, and then type **GlobalBankWestItinerary**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Later in this How-to topic, you will create this itinerary to process messages from GlobalBank West.  
  
#### To add a selection rule for Customer GlobalBank East  
  
1.  In Policy Explorer, right-click the **SetGlobalBankWestItinerary** rule, and then click **Copy**.  
  
2.  Right-click **Version 1.0 (not saved)**, and then click **Paste**.  
  
3.  In the **New Rule Name** dialog box, type **SetGlobalBankEastItinerary**, and then click **OK**.  
  
4.  In Policy Explorer, click the **SetGlobalBankEastItinerary** rule.  
  
5.  In the **Conditions** section, right-click **GlobalBankWest**, and then click **Reset argument**.  
  
6.  Click **argument2**, and then type **GlobalBankEast**.  
  
7.  In the **Actions** section, right-click **GlobalBankWestItinerary**, and then click **Reset argument**.  
  
8.  Click **\<empty string\>** and then type **GlobalBankEastItinerary**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Later in the How-to topic, you will create this itinerary to process messages from GlobalBank East.  
  
#### To publish and deploy the policy  
  
1.  In Policy Explorer, under the **ResolveItineraryBasedOnCustomer** policy, right click **Version 1.0 (not saved)**, and then click **Publish**.
