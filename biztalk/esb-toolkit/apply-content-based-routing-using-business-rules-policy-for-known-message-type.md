# How to: Implement Content-Based Routing Using a Business Rules Policy for a Known Message Type
## Goal  
 This section demonstrates how to create an itinerary that dynamically routes a message, based on the content of a known message type (schema deployed to the Microsoft BizTalk Server Configuration database), using a business rules policy.  
  
 In this How-to topic, you will complete the following steps:  
  
-   Create a business rules policy that will be used to route a message based on content.  
  
-   Create an itinerary routing slip with a BRE resolver to dynamically route a message.  
  
-   Test the itinerary using the Itinerary Test Client sample application.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 The procedures in this How-to topic require the completion of the [Prerequisites for the Development Activities](../esb-toolkit/prerequisites-for-the-development-activities.md).  
  
## Before You Begin  
 Complete the following tasks before you perform the steps later in this How-to topic:  
  
-   Create the GlobalBank West test message.  
  
-   Create the GlobalBank East test message.  
  
 The following procedures describe how to do each of these.  
  
#### To create the GlobalBank West test message  
  
1.  In Windows Explorer, browse to C:\HowTos.  
  
2.  Create a copy of NAOrderDoc.xml, and then name the copy West.xml.  
  
3.  In Notepad, open West.xml, and then change the value of the **customerName** element to **GlobalBankWest**.  
  
4.  Save West.xml as UTF-8, and then close Notepad.  
  
#### To create the GlobalBank East test message  
  
1.  In Windows Explorer, browse to C:\HowTos.  
  
2.  Create a copy of NAOrderDoc.xml, and then name the copy East.xml.  
  
3.  In Notepad, open East.xml, and then change the value of the **customerName** element to **GlobalBankEast**.  
  
4.  Save East.xml as UTF-8, and then close Notepad.  
  
## Steps  
  
#### To create a BRE policy to route using custom message properties  
 This rule will use the customer's name to dynamically set the endpoint used to route the message.  
  
1.  Click **Start** on the taskbar, point to **All Programs**, point to **[!INCLUDE[prague](../includes/prague-md.md)]**, and then click **Business Rule Composer**.  
  
2.  In Policy Explorer, right-click **Policies**, and then click **Add New Policy**. Name the policy **RouteBasedOnCustomerKnownType**.  
  
#### To add a routing rule for customer GlobalBank West  
  
1.  In the **RouteBasedOnCustomerKnownType** policy, right-click **Version 1.0 (not saved)**, and then click **Add New Rule**. Name the rule **SetWestEndpoint**.  
  
2.  In Facts Explorer, click the **XML Schemas** tab, right-click **Schemas**, and then click **Browse**.  
  
3.  In the **Schema Files** dialog box, browse to C:\Projects\Microsoft.Practices.ESB\Source\Samples\DynamicResolution\Source\ESB.DynamicResolution.Schemas, select **NAOrderDoc.xsd**, and then click **Open**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  This is the schema that defines the NAOrderDoc.xml message, which was used to create the West and East messages you will use for testing.  
  
4.  In Facts Explorer, click **NAOrderDoc.xsd**, and then in the Properties pane, click the **Document Type** property, and then type **GlobalBank.ESB.DynamicResolution.Schemas.NAOrderDoc**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  This is the fully qualified name of the schema.  
  
5.  In Facts Explorer, expand **NAOrderDoc.xsd**, and then expand **OrderDoc**.

2.  In Policy Explorer, under the **RouteBasedOnCustomerKnownType** policy, right click **Version 1.0 - Published**, and then click **Deploy**.  
  
#### To create an ESB itinerary DSL model  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../includes/vs2010-md.md)], open C:\HowTos\Patterns\Patterns.sln.  
  
2.  In Solution Explorer, right-click the **ItineraryLibrary** project, point to **Add**, and then click **New Itinerary**.  
  
3.  In the **Add New Item** dialog box, in the **Name** box, type **CbrKnownType**, and then click **Add**.  
  
#### To configure the properties of the itinerary  
  
1.  In Visual Studio, click the design surface of **CbrKnownType.itinerary**. In the **CbrKnownType** Properties window, configure the following properties:  
  
    1.  In the **Model Exporter** drop-down list, click **XML Itinerary Exporter**.  
  
    2.  In the **Extender Settings** section, next to the **Itinerary XML file** property, click the ellipsis button (...).  
  
    3.  In the **Select XML File** dialog box, type **C:\HowTos\Itineraries\CbrKnownType** in the **File name** box, and then click **Save**.  
  
        > [!NOTE]
        >  This step enables you to export the itinerary as XML to a local file location. By exporting an itinerary to a local file location, instead of to the itinerary database, enables testing of the itinerary using the ESB Test Client application. You will complete this process later in this How-to topic.  
  
#### To define the structure of the itinerary
