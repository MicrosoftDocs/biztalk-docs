# Subscribing to Alerts
### To subscribe to an alert  
  
1.  Open the [Portal Alerts Page](../esb-toolkit/portal-alerts-page.md) to see a list of existing alerts and your current subscriptions to these alerts.  
  
2.  In the Action column, click the **AddSubscriber** icon for an existing alert. This opens the [Add Alert Subscription and Edit Subscription Pages](../esb-toolkit/add-alert-subscription-and-edit-subscription-pages.md).  
  
3.  The portal sends alert notifications to the e-mail address associated with the account you use to access the portal. If you want to use a different e-mail address, select the check box next to the **Custom Email** text box, and then type the preferred e-mail address in the text box.  
  
4.  Select the check box in the **Schedule** section if you want to specify a period when the portal should send alerts to you, and then specify the start and end times for the period in the **Start Time** and **EndTime** drop-down lists.  
  
5.  If there is a period when you will be unable to receive and act upon alerts, type the start and end dates in the **Black-out Period** boxes.  
  
6.  Select an **Interval** in **Minutes** during which the portal will compare alerts raised and send only one when multiple instances of the same alert occur. This prevents a rapidly occurring fault from creating a large number of identical alert messages.  
  
7.  Click the **Save** button to create the new subscription.  
  
### To edit an existing alert subscription  
  
1.  Open the [Portal Alerts Page](../esb-toolkit/portal-alerts-page.md) to see a list of existing alerts and your current subscriptions to these alerts.  
  
2.  Click the **Edit** link next to the subscription you want to modify in the list in the **My Subscriptions** section of the page to open the [Add Alert Subscription and Edit Subscription Pages](../esb-toolkit/add-alert-subscription-and-edit-subscription-pages.md).  
  
3.  The portal sends alert notifications to the e-mail address associated with the account you use to access the portal. If you want to use a different e-mail address, select the check box next to the **Custom Email** text box, and then type the preferred e-mail address in the text box.  
  
4.  Select the check box in the **Schedule** section if you want to specify a period when the portal should send alerts to you, and then specify the start and end times for the period in the **Start Time** and **EndTime** drop-down lists.  
  
5.  Type the start and end dates for a **Black-out Period** if there is a period when you will be unable to receive and act upon alerts.  
  
6.  Select an **Interval** in **Minutes** during which the portal will compare alerts raised and will send only one when multiple instances of the same alert occur. This prevents a rapidly occurring fault from creating a large number of identical alert messages.  
  
7.  Click the **Save** button to update the subscription.  
  
### To delete an existing alert subscription  
  
1.  Open the [Portal Alerts Page](../esb-toolkit/portal-alerts-page.md) to see a list of existing alerts and your current subscriptions to these alerts.  
  
2.  Click the **Delete** link next to the subscription you want to delete in the list in the **My Subscriptions** section of the page.
