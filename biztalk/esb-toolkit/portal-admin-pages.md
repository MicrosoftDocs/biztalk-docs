# Portal Admin Pages
When you move the mouse over the **Admin** tab, a pop-up menu provides a list of portal administration tasks. The **Admin** tab is only visible to users who have administrative permission (members of the Microsoft BizTalk Server Administrators account group). The following options are on the pop-up menu:  
  
-   **Manage Audit Log**. This menu item opens the [Audit Log Page](../esb-toolkit/audit-log-page.md) that contains a list of audit events. From this page, you can view the message details associated with the audit event.  
  
-   **Fault Settings**. This menu item opens the [Fault Settings Page](../esb-toolkit/fault-settings-page.md) where you can specify a range of administrative settings for auditing, the Alert Service queue, and the Alert Email service.  
  
-   **Manage Alerts** (Administration view). This menu item opens the [Portal Alerts Page](../esb-toolkit/portal-alerts-page.md) in Administration view. Administrators can use this page to view and edit all alerts and subscriptions within the system. They can also view and edit subscriptions associated with specific alerts.  
  
-   **Registry Settings**. This menu item opens the [Registry Settings Page](../esb-toolkit/registry-settings-page.md) where you can specify a range of administrative settings for registry integration, e-mail notifications, and templates.
