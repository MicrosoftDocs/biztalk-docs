# Installing and Running the Transformation Service Sample
The Transformation Web service directly exposes maps deployed in Microsoft BizTalk through a Web service, thereby eliminating a trip by the message to the BizTalk Message Box database. The Transformation Web service allows external applications to submit a document to the Microsoft.Practices.ESB application and have it transformed using a map deployed within BizTalk.
