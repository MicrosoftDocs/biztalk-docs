# Fault Error Types by Application or Service
This option displays an aggregate view of all faults by specified error type generated for a specified set of applications over a specified time. You can select the specific error type and application to display a report that lists the matching error type faults for that application. You can also export the list of faults as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.  
  
### To view charts and lists of faults by error type, application, and service  
  
1.  Open the [Portal Reports Page](../esb-toolkit/portal-reports-page.md).  
  
2.  Click the **Select Applications** link above the first chart, and then select or clear the check boxes in the list of installed Microsoft BizTalk Server applications that appears. You can also use the links that appear to select all or none of the applications. Click **Save** to show the information for the selected applications, or click **Cancel** to abandon your changes.  
  
3.  To change the period for which the charts display information, select **Hour, Day, Week, Month, Quarter, Year,** or **ALL** in the drop-down list above the first chart.  
  
4.  Each segment in the pie chart relates to a specific error type. Click one of the segments in the chart to display another pie chart showing a breakdown of that error type by application.  
  
5.  Click **Export To Excel** to download the list of faults in a format that you can view in Microsoft Excel.
