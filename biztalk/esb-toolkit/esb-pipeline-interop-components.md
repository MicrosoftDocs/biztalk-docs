# ESB Pipeline Interop Components
The [!INCLUDE[esbToolkit](../includes/esbtoolkit-md.md)] provides support components and services, including the following:  
  
- **JMS pipeline components.** These components recognize, validate, and expose metadata and the content of messages that conform to the JMS MQRFH2 format used by IBM MQ Series messaging systems. This functionality allows a [!INCLUDE[esbToolkit](../includes/esbtoolkit-md.md)] application to receive messages from and send messages to JMS systems over MQ Series. The components automatically promote header information into, and demote it from, the message content.  
  
- **Namespace pipeline components.** These components can add or remove namespaces in the content of XML messages. This allows applications to repair conflicting namespaces or add missing namespaces to prevent namespace collisions within the Message Box database and application orchestrations. The components also allow BizTalk Server to consume POX (Plain Old XML) without modifying external publishing systems.  
  
  For more information about the ESB pipeline components, see [Using the Pipeline Support Components](../esb-toolkit/using-the-pipeline-support-components.md).
