# Service Mediation Patterns

## VETO/VETRO

 The VETRO pattern is a common composite pattern that combines multiple actions taken on a message when it is received. The term VETRO is an acronym that stands for Validate, Enrich, Transform, Route, Operate. In the [!INCLUDE[esbToolkit](../includes/esbtoolkit-md.md)], these actions can be handled as individual stages in the pipeline associated with the receive location. For more information about how each of these stages can be implemented, see Key Scenarios and Development Tasks.

## Request-Response

 The Request-Response pattern defines a solution in which a service or party sends a request message and expects a reply message in return from the destination service. For a detailed description of this pattern, see [Request-Reply](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=186849) ([https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=186849](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=186849)) on the Enterprise Integration Patterns site.

 For more information about how to implement this pattern, see the following resources:
