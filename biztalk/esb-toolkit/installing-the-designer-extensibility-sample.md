# Installing the Designer Extensibility Sample
This section describes the process for installing the Designer Extensibility sample. You must install the samples in [Installing and Running the Itinerary On-Ramp Sample](../esb-toolkit/installing-and-running-the-itinerary-on-ramp-sample.md) and [Installing and Running the Dynamic Resolution Sample](../esb-toolkit/installing-and-running-the-dynamic-resolution-sample.md) before you install and use this sample.  

 **To install the Designer Extensibility sample**  

1. In Windows Explorer, open the folder \Source\Samples\Designer Extensibility Samples\Extenders.Itinerary.OrchestrationSample, where you installed the [!INCLUDE[esbToolkit](../includes/esbtoolkit-md.md)] samples, and then open the Microsoft Visual Studio solution file named Extenders.Itinerary.OrchestrationSample.sln.  

2. In Visual Studio, click **Build Solution** on the **Build** menu.  

3. Close Visual Studio.  

4. In Windows Explorer, open the folder \Source\Samples\Designer Extensibility Samples\Extenders.Resolvers.ResolverSample, where you installed the [!INCLUDE[esbToolkit](../includes/esbtoolkit-md.md)] samples, and then open the Visual Studio solution file named Extenders.Resolvers.ResolverSample.sln.  

5. In Visual Studio, click **Build Solution** on the **Build** menu.  

6. Close Visual Studio.  

7. In Windows Explorer, open the \Lib folder under the Itinerary Designer install path.  

8. From the \bin\Debug folders of the Visual Studio solutions built in the preceding steps, copy the files Extenders.Resolvers.ResolverSample.dll and Extenders.Itinerary.OrchestrationSample.dll to the \Lib directory.
