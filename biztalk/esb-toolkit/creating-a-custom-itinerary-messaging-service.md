# Creating a Custom Itinerary Messaging Service
The itinerary framework that is part of the [!INCLUDE[esbToolkit](../includes/esbtoolkit-md.md)] supports execution of itinerary steps using classes implementing the **IMessagingService** interface that execute itinerary messaging services. You can implement a custom messaging service when you want the service to be responsible for the following:  
  
-   Custom message validation configured in the itinerary  
  
-   Custom message transformation configured in the itinerary  
  
-   Custom processing of the message  
  
 In all these cases, a custom itinerary service that you implement acts as an interceptor and is called by the Dispatcher pipeline component.  
  
 Custom messaging-based itinerary services, or messaging services, all implement the **IMessagingService** interface. This interface exposes the **Name** and **SupportsDisassemble** properties and the **Execute** and **ShouldAdvanceStep** methods.  
  
 The **Name** property is the name of the service as it will appear in an itinerary. It must match the configured name in the itinerary services configuration in the Esb.config file.  
  
 The **SupportsDisassemble** property indicates whether the custom messaging service you are creating supports disassemble and the execution of multiple resolvers.  
  
 The **ShouldAdvanceStep** method takes in the current itinerary step, and the current message, and returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the dispatcher should advance the itinerary after the service executes. In almost all cases, this method should return **true**.  
  
 The **Execute** method is of greatest importance for a messaging service and contains the logic that will be executed at run time. It takes in the pipeline context, the message, the resolver string, and the current itinerary step; and it returns the updated message.  
  
 A reference implementation of the **Execute** method can be found in the RoutingService.cs file of the ESB.Itinerary.Services project, as shown in the following code.  
  
```csharp  
public IBaseMessage ExecuteRoute(IPipelineContext context, IBaseMessage msg, string resolverString)  
        {  
            if (context == null)  
                throw new ArgumentNullException("context");  
            if (msg == null)  
                throw new ArgumentNullException("msg");  
            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(resolverString))  
                throw new ArgumentException(Properties.Resources.ArgumentStringRequired, "resolverString");  
            try  
            {  
                ResolverInfo info = ResolverMgr.GetResolverInfo(ResolutionType.Endpoint, resolverString);  
                if (!info.Success)  
                    throw new RoutingException(Properties.Resources.ResolverStringInvalid, resolverString);  
  
                // Resolve configuration for routing.  
                Dictionary<string, string> resolverDictionary = ResolverMgr.Resolve(info, msg, context);  
  
                if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(resolverDictionary["Resolver.TransportLocation"]))  
                    throw new RoutingException(Properties.Resources.TransportLocationNotResolved, resolverString);  
  
                AdapterMgr.SetEndpoint(resolverDictionary, msg.Context);  
  
                return msg;  
            }  
            catch (System.Exception ex)  
            {  
                EventLogger.Write(MethodInfo.GetCurrentMethod(), ex);  
                throw;  
            }        
        }  
```  
  
 **To implement a custom itinerary service for messaging**  
  
1.  Create an assembly with a class that derives from **IMessagingService;** in the **Execute** method, include all logic necessary to make modifications to the message or the message context (if any).  
  
2.  Add an entry in the **itineraryServices** section of the Esb.config file for your service by adding an **\<itineraryService\>** element with a GUID as the **id** attribute, the name of the service as the **name** attribute, the fully qualified name of the class as the **type** attribute, **Messaging** as the **scope** attribute, and the allowed stage (for example, **OnRampReceive**, **OnRampSend**, **OffRampSend**, **OffRampReceive**, **AllSend**, **AllReceive**, or **All**) as the **stage** attribute.  
  
3.  Register the new assembly in the global assembly cache.
