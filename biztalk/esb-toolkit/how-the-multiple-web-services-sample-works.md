# How the Multiple Web Services Sample Works
The Multiple Web Services sample uses two separate techniques to call multiple Web services in serial while still being able to return a proper result to the original caller. One method uses a custom pipeline component in the response pipeline, and the other method uses a custom two-way routing orchestration-based itinerary service that bypasses the requirement of an off-ramp invocation to complete a request/response call to a Web service.  
  
 The custom pipeline component method uses the Forwarder Pipeline component. This component conditionally promotes properties to keep Microsoft BizTalk from routing the message back to the send pipeline of the on-ramp until all the itinerary services are processed.  
  
 The custom orchestration-based service method uses the TwoWayRouting orchestration contained in the ESB.MultipleWebServices.Orchestrations project in the \Source\Samples\MultipleWebSerivces\Source\ESB.MultipleWebServices.Orchestrations folder. This service processes an associated resolver to determine the endpoint address of a two-way Web service. It then configures a Dynamic Solict-Response Send Port named RoutingPort to send the message to the Web service and return the result to the orchestration. The orchestration then advances the itinerary and returns the resulting message to the MessageBox.  
  
 The itineraries included with the sample use one or both of these methods to ensure message flow following the itinerary is maintained. For more information, see [The Sample Multiple Web Services Itineraries](../esb-toolkit/the-sample-multiple-web-services-itineraries.md).
