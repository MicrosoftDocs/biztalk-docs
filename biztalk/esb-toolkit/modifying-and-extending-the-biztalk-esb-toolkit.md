# Modifying and Extending the BizTalk ESB Toolkit
You can modify and/or extend [!INCLUDE[esbToolkit](../includes/esbtoolkit-md.md)] services and components to suit your specific requirements. For example, you may want to change the behavior of an existing component, create a custom messaging service to use in a pipeline, add providers and adapters, or add other custom features to the [!INCLUDE[esbToolkit](../includes/esbtoolkit-md.md)].  
  
 This section includes the following topics:  
  
-   [Extending the Resolver and Adapter Provider Framework](../esb-toolkit/extending-the-resolver-and-adapter-provider-framework.md)  
  
-   [Creating a Custom Itinerary Service](../esb-toolkit/creating-a-custom-itinerary-service.md)
