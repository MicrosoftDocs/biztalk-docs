# Running the Exception Handling Service Sample
The Exception Handling Service sample demonstrates how to consume the Exception Handling Web Service in order to submit a fault into the ESB Exception Handling Framework from an external application. The following procedure for running this sample requires [Installing the Exception Management Samples](../esb-toolkit/installing-the-exception-management-samples.md).  
  
 **To run the Exception Handling Service sample**  
  
1. In Windows Explorer, open the folder \Source\Samples\ExceptionHandlingService, where you installed the [!INCLUDE[esbToolkit](../includes/esbtoolkit-md.md)] samples, and then open the Visual Studio solution file named ExceptionHandlingService.sln.  
  
2. In Visual Studio, click **Start Debugging** on the Toolbar.  
  
3. On the form that loads, click the **Generate Exception** button.  
  
4. In Windows Explorer, open the folder \Samples\Exception Handling\Test\Filedrop\All_Exceptions, and then open the most recent Exceptions_{GUID}.xml file.  
  
5. Examine the contents of the generated exception.  
  
   For more information about how the Exception Handling Service sample uses the Exception Management service, see [How the Exception Handling Service Sample Works](../esb-toolkit/how-the-exception-handling-service-sample-works.md).
