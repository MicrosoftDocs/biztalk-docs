# BizTalk Server Integration
The SOA Service Manager provides wizards that help you set up the SOA Service Manager for use with Microsoft BizTalk Server. For example, Figure 1 shows the wizard that helps you install and configure the BizTalk Integration Point that links BizTalk Server send ports and receive locations to the SOA Service Manager.

 After installation, the SOA Service Manager can display details of the send ports and receive locations configured by the wizard. Figure 2 shows the Operations page displaying the name, interface, policy, and the number of virtual operations for three receive locations and a send port.
