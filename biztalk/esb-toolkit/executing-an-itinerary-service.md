# Executing an Itinerary Service
An ESB itinerary can contain any itinerary service that may be implemented as orchestration or messaging to perform the following tasks:  
  
- It can receive the message containing the itinerary.  
  
- It can retrieve the current itinerary step.  
  
- It can process the service.  
  
- It can advance the itinerary on the outgoing message by calling the **Advance** method.  
  
- It can publish the processed message back into the Microsoft BizTalk Message Box database.  
  
  For example, an orchestration can receive a message that contains an itinerary by implementing a filter defined on the activated receive shape, as shown in Figure 1 of [Using an Orchestration as an Itinerary Service Subscriber](../esb-toolkit/using-an-orchestration-as-an-itinerary-service-subscriber.md). However, messaging is slightly different: the pipeline component calls the **GetItineraryStep** method to determine whether an itinerary exists in an incoming message. It also examines the message properties to check whether it should process it.  
  
  ![Orchestration](../esb-toolkit/media/ch4-orchestration.jpg "Ch4-Orchestration")  
  
  **Figure 1**  
  
  **Example filter expression for an orchestration that will participate in an itinerary as a subscriber**  
  
  After the service obtains the message, it must call the **GetItineraryStep** method, which returns an instance of the **ItineraryStep** class. The following listings demonstrate how you can call the methods of the itinerary API from both an orchestration and a custom pipeline component. The following code executes the **GetItineraryStep** method from an orchestration Expression shape.  
  
```  
  
//XLANGs  
// Retrieve the current itinerary step.  
itinerary = new Microsoft.Practices.ESB.Itinerary.SerializableItineraryWrapper();  
step = new Microsoft.Practices.ESB.Itinerary.SerializableItineraryStepWrapper();  
  
itinerary.Itinerary = Microsoft.Practices.ESB.Itinerary.ItineraryOMFactory.Create(InboundMessage);  
step.ItineraryStep = itinerary.Itinerary.GetItineraryStep(InboundMessage);  
```  
  
 The following code shows how to execute the messaging service method from a custom pipeline component.  
  
```csharp  
// Execute messaging step.  
public IBaseMessage Execute(IPipelineContext context, IBaseMessage msg, string resolverString, IItineraryStep step)  
{  
    if (null != step  
    && step.ServiceType == "Messaging"  
    && step.ServiceName == "SomeService")  
    {  
        // If the service name matches the required name, process the message here.  
    }  
    else  
    {  
        // Do not process the message.  
        return pInMsg;  
    }  
}  
```  
  
 The instance of the **IItineraryStep** class contains all the metadata for the current service, including ambient properties of the current service execution environment. Two good examples of this are the **ServiceInstanceID** and the current **MessageDirection** properties for a pipeline component.  
  
 After a service calls the **GetItineraryStep** method, it can retrieve any associated resolvers. The **ResolverCollection** property of the **ItineraryStep** class returns a collection of resolvers that the service can enumerate through, as shown in the following example.  
  
```csharp  
Microsoft.Practices.ESB.Itinerary.ResolverCollection resolvers;  
resolvers = step.ItineraryStep.ResolverCollection;  
```  
  
 Each item in the **ResolverCollection** represents a resolver connection string that matches one of the types supported by the Resolver and Adapter Framework. For example, an item in the collection could look like the following listing.  
  
```idl  
BRE:\\policy=GetCanadaPurchaseEndPoint;version=;useMsg=;  
UDDI:\\serverUrl=http://localhost/uddi;serviceName=OrderFileServiceWBindings;  
STATIC:\\TransportLocation=http://localhost/ESB.CanadianServices/SubmitPOService.asmx;  
TargetNamespace=http://globalbank.esb.dynamicresolution.com/canadianservices/;  
XPATH:\\TransportType=; TransportLocation=/*[local-name()='OrderDoc' and namespace-  
uri()='http://globalbank.esb.dynamicresolution.com/northamericanservices/']/*  
[local-name()='ID' and namespace-  
uri()='http://globalbank.esb.dynamicresolution.com/northamericanservices/'];  
TargetNamespace=/*[local-name()='OrderDoc' and namespace-  
uri()='http://globalbank.esb.dynamicresolution.com/northamericanservices/']/*  
[local-name()='customerName' and namespace-  
uri()='http://globalbank.esb.dynamicresolution.com/northamericanservices/'];  
```  
  
 The resolver manager in the Resolver and Adapter Provider Framework can resolve the endpoints and set the endpoint properties of the message. For more information about how this occurs, see [Using Dynamic Resolution and Routing](../esb-toolkit/using-dynamic-resolution-and-routing.md).  
  
 After the service finishes processing the message, it must advance the itinerary on the outgoing message and publish the message back to the Message Box database. The following example shows the process for an orchestration Expression shape.  
  
```xml  
  
//XLANGs  
// Copy the context to the outbound message.  
OutboundMessage = InboundMessage;  
OutboundMessage(*) = InboundMessage(*);  
  
// Call the method of the ItinerarySerializableWrapper to advance to the next step.  
itinerary.Itinerary.Advance(OutboundMessage, step.ItineraryStep);  
```  
  
 The following example shows how to indicate that [!INCLUDE[esbToolkit](../includes/esbtoolkit-md.md)] core engine should advance itinerary for a custom pipeline component.  
  
```csharp  
// Advance Itinerary  
// <summary>  
// Signals that the step should be advanced immediately following execution of the service.  
// </summary>  
// <param name="step">Current step</param>  
// <param name="msg">Current message</param>  
// <returns>True to advance the itinerary.</returns>  
public bool ShouldAdvanceStep(IItineraryStep step, IBaseMessage msg)  
{  
    return true;  
}  
```
