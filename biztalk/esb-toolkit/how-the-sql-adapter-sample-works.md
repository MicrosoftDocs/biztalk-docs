# How the SQL Adapter Sample Works
The SQL Adapter sample provides a sample two-way itinerary configured with the routing service and a transform messaging service.  
  
 The routing service is configured with a STATIC resolver, which specifies that the message should be routed to execute a SQL stored procedure within the GlobalBankESB database named InsertProduct using the WCF-Custom adapter provider.  
  
 The transform service specifies a map that converts the incoming message to the format accepted by the InsertProduct stored procedure.
