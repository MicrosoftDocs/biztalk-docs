# Installing and Running the Scatter-Gather Sample
The Scatter-Gather sample shows how you can develop an orchestration as a custom itinerary step to apply the Scatter-Gather design pattern by resolving and sending asynchronous requests to multiple services and aggregating their asynchronous responses into a single response message to forward to another endpoint location. The sample uses the test client application provided with the Itinerary On-Ramp sample and artifacts provided with the Dynamic Resolution sample.
