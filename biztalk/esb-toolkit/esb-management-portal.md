# ESB Management Portal
The [!INCLUDE[esbToolkit](../includes/esbtoolkit-md.md)] includes a comprehensive Web-based exception and fault message management framework that promotes consistent handling of both system and business exceptions. The included portal serves as a sample of how a portal application can provide metrics and visibility into ESB activities.  
  
 The ESB Management Portal provides exception mediation capabilities through an auditing and tracking mechanism. It also captures messages (including the context properties) that were "in flight" at the time that the exception occurred. This enables powerful exception recovery and "repair and resubmit" patterns.  
  
 To allow administrators and users to easily manage ESB applications, the portal also provides an alert and notification mechanism that can generate alerts based on custom conditions and send notifications to subscribers.  
  
 To monitor application performance and analyze fault trends, the portal can generate and display a range of charts and reports, configurable over specified periods of time, and include data from specified BizTalk applications.  
  
 Additionally, the portal integrates with a Microsoft UDDI 3.0 server to provide a graphical user interface for publishing BizTalk endpoints to UDDI, either automatically or through an administrator-controlled approval process.  
  
 For more information about the ESB Management Portal, see [The Components of the Exception Management Framework](../esb-toolkit/the-components-of-the-exception-management-framework.md).
