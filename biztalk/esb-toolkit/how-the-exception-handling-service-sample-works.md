# How the Exception Handling Service Sample Works
The Exception Handling Service sample is a standard .NET Windows Forms application that contains a generated service proxy for the exception handling service. The application consists of a single form with a single button, **Generate Exception**. When you click this button, an instance of the **FaultMessage** class is generated. The **FaultMessage** class is a class that was generated by Microsoft Visual Studio based on the Web Services Description Language (WSDL) provided by the Exception Handling Web service. The properties of this instance are populated with default values that simulate a fault occurring in an external application before the properties are passed as parameters to the **SubmitFault** method of the Exception Handling Web service.  
  
 For more information about how the Exception Handling Web service works, see [The Exception Handling Web Service](../esb-toolkit/the-exception-handling-web-service.md).
