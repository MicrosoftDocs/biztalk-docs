# Contents of the BizTalk ESB Toolkit
The [!INCLUDE[esbToolkit](../includes/esbtoolkit-md.md)] provides architectural guidance, patterns and practices, and a collection of BizTalk Server and .NET Framework components to simplify the development of enterprise-scale solutions on the Microsoft platform. The toolkit also provides capabilities to help developers extend existing messaging and integration solutions. The [!INCLUDE[esbToolkit](../includes/esbtoolkit-md.md)] consists of a collection of interoperating components that support and implement a loosely coupled messaging environment that simplifies the process of building dynamic message-based enterprise applications.  

 The [!INCLUDE[esbToolkit](../includes/esbtoolkit-md.md)] contains the following components:  

- [ESB Web Services](../esb-toolkit/esb-web-services.md). These expose key capabilities to ESB consumers, such as itinerary-based routing, exception management, dynamic resolution of endpoints and maps, BizTalk operations, Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI) interoperability, and transformation of message content.  

- [ESB Management Portal](../esb-toolkit/esb-management-portal.md). This provides support for exception and fault tracking, message resubmission, alerts and notifications, UDDI integration, reporting and analytics, and configuration capabilities.  

- [ESB Pipeline Interop Components](../esb-toolkit/esb-pipeline-interop-components.md). These provide BizTalk Server pipeline components that facilitate interoperability with external systems.  

- [Exception Management Framework](../esb-toolkit/exception-management-framework.md). This captures and consolidates exceptions from both BizTalk Messaging and Orchestration subsystems and provides a single mechanism for handling fault messages. It includes the exception Web service, the exception management API, and components that enrich, process, and pass exception details to the ESB Management Portal.  

- [ESB Resolver and Adapter Provider Framework](../esb-toolkit/esb-resolver-and-adapter-provider-framework.md). This implements a pluggable and configurable architecture for dynamically resolving endpoints and transform requirements and for routing messages.  

- [Itinerary-Based Routing and Processing](../esb-toolkit/itinerary-based-routing-and-processing.md). The Itinerary Processing mechanism provides a lightweight capability for dynamically describing, submitting, and executing multiple service invocations or routing/transformation requests.  

- [BizTalk ESB Toolkit Sample Applications](../esb-toolkit/biztalk-esb-toolkit-sample-applications.md). The included sample applications demonstrate possible implementations of the [!INCLUDE[esbToolkit](../includes/esbtoolkit-md.md)] and how you can use the [!INCLUDE[esbToolkit](../includes/esbtoolkit-md.md)] features in your own SOA and ESB applications.
