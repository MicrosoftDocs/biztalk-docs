# Installing the Itinerary On-Ramp Sample
The Itinerary On-Ramp sample depends on the [!INCLUDE[esbToolkit](../includes/esbtoolkit-md.md)] core solution, the Dynamic Resolution sample, and the Resolver Service sample. Installing the [!INCLUDE[esbToolkit](../includes/esbtoolkit-md.md)] core automatically copies and installs the core assemblies required by this sample to the correct locations. Installing the Dynamic Resolution sample and Resolver Service sample ensures that the Web services and Business Rules Engine policies used by the Itinerary On-Ramp Sample are correctly installed and configured.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You must install the [Installing the Dynamic Resolution Sample](../esb-toolkit/installing-the-dynamic-resolution-sample.md) and the [Installing the Resolver Service Sample](../esb-toolkit/installing-the-resolver-service-sample.md) before you install this sample.  
>   
>  The ESB sample applications reside a Microsoft BizTalk application named GlobalBank.ESB. In addition, this sample use artifacts installed in the core Microsoft.Practices.ESB application. Before you install the Itinerary On-Ramp sample, you must add a reference to the Microsoft.Practices.ESB application to the GlobalBank.ESB application.
