# Using Dynamic Resolution and Routing
In addition to itinerary-based routing, the [!INCLUDE[esbToolkit](../includes/esbtoolkit-md.md)] supports dynamic resolution as configuration-based routing to avoid the requirement for hard-coded routing information in components and services. This section contains the following topics:  
  
-   [Dynamic Resolution and Routing Overview](../esb-toolkit/dynamic-resolution-and-routing-overview.md)  
  
-   [The Resolver and Adapter Provider Framework](../esb-toolkit/the-resolver-and-adapter-provider-framework.md)  
  
-   [Using the Resolver Components in Your Code](../esb-toolkit/using-the-resolver-components-in-your-code.md)  
  
-   [Using Dynamic Routing](../esb-toolkit/using-dynamic-routing.md)
