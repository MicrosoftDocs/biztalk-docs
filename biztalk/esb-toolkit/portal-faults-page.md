# Portal Faults Page
Figure 1 shows the Faults page. This page displays the main properties of each fault, and it provides sorting and filtering capabilities that support detailed analysis of faults over a range of criteria, such as error type and time. A link for each fault allows you to view more details in the Fault Message Viewer.

 The following list explains how you can use the features of the ESB Management Portal Faults page:  
  
-   To filter the list of faults displayed in the page, use the drop-down lists and text boxes above the list of faults. You can filter the rows displayed in the following ways:  
  
    -   Select any one of the installed BizTalk applications in the **Application** drop-down list.  
  
    -   Specify the period within which the fault occurred by selecting **hour, day, week, month, quarter, year,** or **all** in the **Retrieve records within last** drop-down list.  
  
    -   Specify how many rows you want to display on the page in the **Records Per Page** drop-down list.  
  
    -   Type a fault code number in the **Fault Code** text box.  
  
    -   Type all or part of the fault category name in the **Fault Category** text box.  
  
    -   Type all or part of the error type text in the **Error Type** text box.  
  
    -   Type a value for the minimum and/or maximum fault severity (such as **Warning, Error, Severe,** or **Critical**) in the **Min Fault Severity** and **Max Fault Severity** text boxes.  
  
-   After you specify the values for one or more of these controls, click the **Apply Filters** button to apply all the specified criteria.  
  
-   Click a column heading to display the fault message rows in the order of that column contents, and then click again to display the list in reverse order.  
  
-   To display more details of a fault shown in the list, or to edit and resubmit the message it contains, click anywhere in the row for that fault to open it in the [Portal Fault Message Viewer](../esb-toolkit/portal-fault-message-viewer.md).
