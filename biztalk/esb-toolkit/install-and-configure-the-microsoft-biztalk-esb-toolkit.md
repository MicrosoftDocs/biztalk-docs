# Install and configure the Microsoft BizTalk ESB Toolkit

Starting with BizTalk Server 2013 and newer versions, [!INCLUDE[esbToolkit](../includes/esbtoolkit-md.md)] is integrated with the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] setup. This topic shows you how to install and configure [!INCLUDE[esbToolkit](../includes/esbtoolkit-md.md)], and also includes a community-written link to upgrade the ESB Toolkit.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> BizTalk Server must be installed before you install the [!INCLUDE[esbToolkit_short](../includes/esbtoolkit-short-md.md)].  
  
## Install 
  
1. Run the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] setup.exe file as Administrator. In setup, select **Install [!INCLUDE[esbToolkit](../includes/esbtoolkit-md.md)]**.  
  
2. Accept the license agreement, and then select **Next**.  
  
3. In **Component Installation**, select the components you want to install, and then select **Next**.  
  
4. In the **Summary**, review what you chose, and then select **Install**.  
  
5. Select **Finish** to close the installation wizard. An install log file is created, similar to `C:\Users\yourUserName\AppData\Local\Temp\Setup(081017 175042).htm`.

6. **Starting with BizTalk Server 2020**, to install **Itinerary Designer**, also install **BizTalk ESB Toolkit Itinerary Designer extension** in **Visual Studio**.

## Configure 
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  You must configure [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] before configuring [!INCLUDE[esbToolkit_short](../includes/esbtoolkit-short-md.md)].  
  
1. From the **Start** menu, select **Microsoft [!INCLUDE[esbToolkit](../includes/esbtoolkit-md.md)]**, and then select **ESB Configuration Tool**.  
  
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   >  Run the ESB Configuration Tool as an administrator.  
  
2. In the configuration, select **Database Server**. Enter the database server name that hosts the [!INCLUDE[esbToolkit_short](../includes/esbtoolkit-short-md.md)] databases.   
  
3. In **IIS Web Services**, enter the user account and password that runs the IIS applications created by the [!INCLUDE[esbToolkit_short](../includes/esbtoolkit-short-md.md)]. Next, enter the IIS website that hosts the applications.  
  
4. The **BizTalk User Groups** lists the default user groups typically used for ESB configuration.  
  
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   >  At this stage, you can select **Apply Configuration** to configure the [!INCLUDE[esbToolkit_short](../includes/esbtoolkit-short-md.md)] with these default settings. However, if you want to do a custom configuration, complete the remaining steps. Rhe values you enter in the next steps take precedence over the default values.  
  
5. In the left pane, expand **ESB Configuration**, expand **Exception Management**, and then:  
  
   -   If you don't want to configure an exception management database, then select **Database**, and uncheck the **Enable Exception Management Database**.
  
   -   If you want to use an existing database instead of creating a new database, then select **Database**, and select the **Use Existing Database**. Enter the database server name and the database name.  
  
   -   If you don't want to configure exception web service, then select **Exception Web Services**, and uncheck **Enable Exception Services**.  If you want to run these services under a different website, you can enter that here.  
  
6. In the left pane, expand **ESB Core Components**, and then:  
  
   -   If you don't want to configure an itinerary database, then select **Itinerary Database**, and uncheck **Itinerary Database** .  
  
   -   If you want to use an existing itinerary database, then select **Itinerary Database**, and select **Use Existing Database**. Enter the database server name and the database name.  
  
   -   If you don't want to configure these web service, then select **Core Web Services**, and uncheck **Enable Core Services**. If you want to run these services under a different website, you can enter that here.
  
7. In the left pane, select **Configuration**.  
   If you are installing and configuring the [!INCLUDE[esbToolkit_short](../includes/esbtoolkit-short-md.md)] in a single server environment, select **File Configuration Source**. If you are setting up a multiple-machine deployment, select the **SSO Configuration Source**, and then enter the following:  
  
   -   **SSO Server**: Enter the name of the SSO server
  
   -   **Configuration file**: Select the ellipsis **(…)**, and then browse to the esb.config file (\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft BizTalk ESB Toolkit)
  
   -   **Application Name**: Enter a name for the SSO application. For example,  enter `ESB Toolkit`.  
  
   -   **Contact Information**: Enter a valid email address the appropriate contact information in the following format: `someone@example.com`.  
  
   -   **Administrator Group Name**: Select the ellipsis **(…)**, and then browse to the appropriate admin group  
  
   -   **User Group Name**: Select the ellipsis **(…)**, and then browse to the appropriate group  

8. Select **Apply Configuration**. Open IIS and notice that the applications required for [!INCLUDE[esbToolkit_short](../includes/esbtoolkit-short-md.md)] are now created under the website you specified while configuring [!INCLUDE[esbToolkit_short](../includes/esbtoolkit-short-md.md)].  
  
9. In the **ESB Configuration Tool**, select **ESB BizTalk Applications**, and then:  
  
   - Select **Enable ESB Core Components in BizTalk Server** to create the application in the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console. Select **Use Default Binding** to bind this application to the default host. Select **Do not use Default Binding** if you do not want to bind the application to the default host. In this scenario, you must explicitly bind the application to a host once the application is created.  
  
   - Select **Enable ESB JMS/WMQ Components in BizTalk Server** to create the application in the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console. Select **Use Default Binding** to bind this application to the default host. Select **Do not use Default Binding** if you do not want to bind the application to the default host. In this scenario, you must explicitly bind the application to a host once the application is created.
