# Resubmissions over Time by Application or Service
This option displays a count of failed message resubmissions over a specified period for a specified set of applications. You can select an application to display a trend chart showing the number of resubmissions over time for specific services within the application. Selecting a specific service displays a report that lists the resubmissions for that service. You can also export the list of resubmissions as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.  
  
### To view charts and lists of resubmissions over time by application or service  
  
1.  Open the [Portal Reports Page](../esb-toolkit/portal-reports-page.md).  
  
2.  Click the **Select Applications** link above the first chart, and then select or clear the check boxes in the list of installed Microsoft BizTalk Server applications that appears. You can also use the links that appear to select all or none of the applications. Click **Save** to show the information for the selected applications, or click **Cancel** to abandon your changes.  
  
3.  To change the period for which the charts display information, select **Hour, Day, Week, Month, Quarter, Year,** or **ALL** in the drop-down list above the first chart.  
  
4.  Click the name of an application in the chart keys section to display a trend chart for resubmissions for each of the services within that application.  
  
5.  Click the name of a service in this chart to display a table listing all the resubmissions for the selected service.  
  
6.  Click **Export To Excel** to download the list of resubmissions in a format that you can view in Microsoft Excel.
