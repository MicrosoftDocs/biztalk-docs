# Viewing and Publishing UDDI Registrations
The ESB Management Portal integrates with a Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI) registry and can publish entries into the server in addition to displaying existing registration entries. The portal supports both an auto-publish capability and an approval process that allows administrators to control the publication of entries to the UDDI server. This section describes the following common tasks:  
  
-   [Publishing BizTalk Endpoints](../esb-toolkit/publishing-biztalk-endpoints.md)  
  
-   [The Auto-Enlist and Approval Process](../esb-toolkit/the-auto-enlist-and-approval-process.md)  
  
-   [Publishing from the BizTalk Server Administration Console](../esb-toolkit/publishing-from-the-biztalk-server-administration-console.md)
