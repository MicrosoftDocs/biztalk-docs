# Step 4: Create a Receive Port for Accepting the Batch Message
In this step, you create and configure a port to receive the incoming batch.  

 You create a request-response (two-way) receive port, because the scenario includes the generation of application-accept acknowledgments for the individual messages in the batch. In two-way mode, the MLLP receive adapter will not accept a new incoming message until the receive pipeline has generated the acknowledgment (ACK) for the previous message.  

## Create the receive port for accepting the batch message  

1. Open **BizTalk Server Administration**, expand **BizTalk Server Administration**, expand **BizTalk Group**, expand **Applications**, and then expand **BizTalk Application 1**.  

   > [!NOTE]
   >  The BizTalk Server Administration Console can also be opened from within Visual Studio by clicking **BizTalk Server Administration** in the **Tools** menu.  

2. Right-click **Receive Ports**, select **New**, and then select **Request Response Receive Port**.  

3. For the **Name**, enter **Tutorial_2WayReceive**.  

4. Select **Apply** to bind the port, and then select **Receive Locations**.  

5. Select **New**.  

6. For the **Name**, enter **Tutorial_2WayReceive**.

7. In the **Transport** section, select **Type**, and then select **MLLP** from the drop-down list.  

8. Select **Configure**. In **MLLP Transport Properties**, configure the following, and then select **OK**.
