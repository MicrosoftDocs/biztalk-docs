# Logging process, event monitoring, and service debugging

Since your applications handle critical, time sensitive and monetary data, auditing becomes a critical part of the application. To enable enterprise level manageability and availability, Microsoft [!INCLUDE[HL7_CurrentVersion_abbrev](../../includes/hl7-currentversion-abbrev-md.md)] relies on the following shared run time and administrative components:

- **Logging**: to collect and route all log events in a managed way to a designated database

- **Event Monitoring and Service Debugging**: to configure logging behavior and to investigate/manage collected information for system administrators and other IT professionals

  With the enhanced auditing features in [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)], you can optimize your operational efficiency, security, and performance to ensure compliance with HL7 regulations.

## Types of Data

This topic describes different types of logging data used by the logging feature and where this data is stored:

- Configuration data: Logging configuration data is stored in the Configuration database (also known as the BizTalk Management database) and includes SQL auditing information and audit data ([!INCLUDE[btsWinNTNoVersion](../../includes/btswinntnoversion-md.md)] Event viewer, centralized database WMI) location.

- Archival data: The EventLog table in the SQL log stores the 'Logging' data.

## How Logging Works

This topic describes the three types of events the software logs, as well as the three locations where you can store the logged data.

|Component|Purpose|
|---------------|-------------|
|Configuration Editor|To specify where to save the log data. BTAHL7 supports logging to any combination of the following: Event Viewer, WMI, and SQL Server logging.|
|Event Broker|To receive log events raised by other components and log them based on logging configuration data.|
|Logging API|Logging interface called by all BTAHL7 assemblies.|

### Types of Logging

[!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] logs three types of errors:

- Informational events, such a service started or stopped or an event failed.

- Warning events such as non-critical errors and warnings in [!INCLUDE[btsWinNTNoVersion](../../includes/btswinntnoversion-md.md)] Event logs. For example, [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] suspends a message because data validation failed.

- Error events for critical failures in a component. For example, [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] suspends a message because of parser failures.

  The system can log [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] events into following configurable locations:

- [!INCLUDE[btsWinNTNoVersion](../../includes/btswinntnoversion-md.md)] Event viewer

- WMI events

- Centralized database (SQL logging database)

  An event broker receives all [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] logging events and, based on the configuration information, sends them to the appropriate location.

### Overview of Features

The [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] logging feature provides:

- A unified way of logging all the error messages

- A centralized repository for storing all event details

- A consistent object model for logging messages flowing to discrete line-of-business applications

- A combination of logging and tracing to help system administrators correlate logged errors with documents

## Event Log Data

This topic describes the format and content of the event log data.

The following table shows typical logged data for partners.

|Data|Description|
|----------|-----------------|
|LogData|Data log|
|CategoryNumber|Category number|
|EntryType|Type of the event|
|EventId|Event ID|
|MachineName|Computer name|
|Message|Message detail|
|Source|Creating, updating, reading, deleting, deploying, or archiving data|
|TimeGenerated|Success or Failure|
|UserName|User name|
|MsgGuid|Message GUID|
|SvcGuid|Service GUID|
|Operation|Operation detail|
