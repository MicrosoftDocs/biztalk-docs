# Creating a WMI Sink for Auditing and Logging Events
You can use the following sample code to create a [!INCLUDE[btsWinNoVersion](../../includes/btswinnoversion-md.md)] Management Instrumentation (WMI) sink to monitor auditing and logging events:  
  
 `//Create the WMI query and Event watcher and subscribe to events`  
  
 `ManagementEventWatcher watcher = new ManagementEventWatcher ("root/Default", "select * from  PackageEvent");`  
  
 `ManagementBaseObject evtObj = watcher.WaitForNextEvent();`  
  
 `//Do what you want with the event`
