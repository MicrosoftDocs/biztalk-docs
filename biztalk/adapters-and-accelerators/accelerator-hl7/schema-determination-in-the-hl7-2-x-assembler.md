# Schema Determination in the HL7 2.X Assembler
When a message flows to the serializer, the serializer in Microsoft BizTalk Accelerator for HL7 ([!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)]) uses MSH5 (destination party) of the message to determine the operations to be performed on the message. Such operations include:  
  
- Whether to perform XML validation for body segments  
  
- Whether to validate custom data types for body segments  
  
- Whether to allow trailing delimiters in the body  
  
- Which schema target namespace the serializer will use  
  
- Whether the serializer needs to map the header  
  
  To determine the schema, the serializer does the following:  
  
- Sets the target namespace (**TargetNS**) to the same value as the namespace configured for the destination party  
  
- Extracts **Rootnode** from the **BTS.MessageType** promoted property  
  
  The **doctype** becomes **TargetNS + "#" + Rootnode**.
