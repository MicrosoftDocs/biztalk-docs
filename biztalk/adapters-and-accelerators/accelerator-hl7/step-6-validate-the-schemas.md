# Step 6: Validate the Schemas
In this step, you use the validate schema command to determine if either of the schemas contains any internal inconsistencies, or has other issues that might prevent either schema from being used effectively for processing instance messages.  
  
### To validate the schema  
  
1. In Solution Explorer, right-click **Doorbell.xsd** and then click **Validate Schema**. Ensure that a success message appears in the output window.  
  
    If a success message does not appear, verify that you created **Doorbell.xsd** properly.  
  
2. Repeat step 1 for the **ADT_A04_22_GLO_DEF.xsd** schema file. Ensure that a success message appears in the output window.
