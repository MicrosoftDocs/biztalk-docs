# HL7 Disassembler and Assembler
The HL7 disassembler and assembler provide support for HL7-encoded messages. Since Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] processes messages natively in XML format, Microsoft BizTalk Accelerator for HL7 ([!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)]) uses the HL7 disassembler and assembler to make [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] an HL7 integration engine.  
  
## HL7 Disassembler  
 The HL7 disassembler parses incoming HL7-encoded messages into XML segments for processing. It performs validation of the message header, and basic validation of the body. It determines the schema that it uses to parse the HL7 message (see [Schema Determination in the HL7 2.X Disassembler](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-hl7/schema-determination-in-the-hl7-2-x-disassembler.md)), determines the source party for the message, and performs additional validation of the body (if enabled for the party).  
  
## HL7 Assembler  
 The HL7 assembler serializes XML segments into an outgoing HL7 message. It determines the schema that it uses to serialize the HL7 message (see [Schema Determination in the HL7 2.X Assembler](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-hl7/schema-determination-in-the-hl7-2-x-assembler.md)), determines the destination party for the message, and performs validation of the body (if enabled for the party).  
  
 The assembler can serialize the following acknowledgment (ACK) messages:  
  
- Static  
  
- Original mode  
  
- Enhanced mode  
  
  The HL7 assembler also has the ability to route deferred ACK messages.
