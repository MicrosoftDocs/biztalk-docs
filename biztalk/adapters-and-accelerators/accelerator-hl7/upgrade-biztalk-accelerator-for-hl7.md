# Upgrade BizTalk Accelerator for HL7
Overview of the [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL7NoNumber](../../includes/btabtahl7nonumber-md.md)] upgrade process. 
  
<a name="BKMK_BeforeUpgrade"></a>   
## Before you upgrade  
  
-   The user running the upgrade must be a member of the BizTalk Administrators group.  
  
-   The SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) service must be running when you perform an upgrade.  
  
-   Do not run a silent installation to upgrade.  
  
-   When you upgrade, the setup program migrates the existing [!INCLUDE[HL7_CurrentVersion_abbrev_md](../../includes/hl7-currentversion-abbrev-md.md)] configuration information to the newer version.  
  
-   When you upgrade, the registry keys and databases are automatically backed up.  
  
-   The files in the *\<drive\>*:\Program Files\Microsoft BizTalk \<version\> Accelerator for HL7 folder are updated.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The upgrade does not create a new folder for the upgraded files, nor does it change the name of the existing folder.

## Supported Upgrade Paths  
 The following table lists the supported [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] versions that can be upgraded. “Yes” means the [!INCLUDE[HL7_CurrentVersion_abbrev_md](../../includes/hl7-currentversion-abbrev-md.md)] version can be upgraded. “No” means the [!INCLUDE[HL7_CurrentVersion_abbrev_md](../../includes/hl7-currentversion-abbrev-md.md)] version cannot be upgraded. If the [!INCLUDE[HL7_CurrentVersion_abbrev_md](../../includes/hl7-currentversion-abbrev-md.md)] version is not listed, that version cannot be upgraded.

## Upgrade Steps  
  
1.  Upgrade the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)].   
  
2.  Back up the [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] databases and your HL7 message schemas.  
  
3.  Back up any files under the ***\<drive\>*:\Program Files\Microsoft BizTalk Accelerator for HL7** folder that you have changed. For example, back up files in the SDK.  
  
4.  Install the appropriate update for your version of [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)]:  
  
    -   If upgrading from BTAHL7 2010, install **HL72010Patch.msp**.  
  
    -   If upgrading from BTAHL7 2013, install **HL72013Patch.msp**.  
    
  
5.  Run the [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL7NoNumber](../../includes/btabtahl7nonumber-md.md)] setup. See [Install BizTalk Accelerator for HL7](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-hl7/install-biztalk-accelerator-for-hl7.md).  
  
6.  Deploy the new BTAHL7V2*x*Common project.  
  
7.  Redeploy all other assemblies.  
  
8.  Rebuild any projects or assemblies that have a reference to one or more of the [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] assemblies. Using **BTSTask.exe** in \<*drive*\>:\Program Files\Microsoft BizTalk Server \<version\>, manually redeploy these projects.  
  
9. Restart the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] service.

## Upgrading in a Multi-server Environment  
 In a multi-server [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] environment, upgrade all [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)]s, and then upgrade the [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL7NoNumber](../../includes/btabtahl7nonumber-md.md)] on all servers. Migrate your servers in the following order:  
  
-   The server hosting the BizTalk Group  
  
-   Each processing node  
  
-   The BAM portal server
