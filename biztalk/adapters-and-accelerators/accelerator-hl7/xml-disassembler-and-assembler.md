# XML Disassembler and Assembler
The XML disassembler and assembler ensure that Microsoft BizTalk Accelerator for HL7 ([!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)]) not only supports HL7-encoded messages, but also supports incoming and/or outgoing XML messages.  
  
## XML Disassembler  
 The XML disassembler parses incoming XML messages into XML segments for processing. As it parses the messages, the disassembler performs the following tasks:  
  
- Handles escape sequences  
  
- Handles checks of required/optional properties  
  
- Handles declared Z segments  
  
  As it parses the messages, the dissassembler performs the following:  
  
- Syntactic validation  
  
- Schema validation (if enabled)  
  
## XML Assembler  
 The XML assembler serializes XML segments into an outgoing XML message. The XML assembler supports and creates the following acknowledgment (ACK) messages:  
  
- Static  
  
- Original mode  
  
- Enhanced mode  
  
  The XML assembler also has the ability to route deferred ACK messages.
