# BizTalk Server - A Role-based Product

Microsoft BizTalk Server and Microsoft BizTalk Accelerator for HL7 ([!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)]) provide features and tools in the environment appropriate for the role of the user, as described in the following:

- Tools for the developer are integrated into [!INCLUDE[btsVStudio2008](../../includes/btsvstudio2008-md.md)]. Developers can manage their solutions and projects in Solution Explorer, and have immediate access to the BizTalk design time tools.

- The Microsoft Management Console (MMC) hosts the tools for the IT professional. Interface analysts, IT implementers, and IT operators administer their [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] system through the MMC-based BizTalk Administration console, BizTalk Explorer, [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] Configuration Explorer, and other run time tools.
