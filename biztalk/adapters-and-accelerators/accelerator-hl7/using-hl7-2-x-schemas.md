# Using HL7 2.X Schemas
This section discusses the 2.X versions of the Health Level Seven (HL7) standard supported by Microsoft [!INCLUDE[HL7_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/hl7-currentversion-firstref-md.md)].  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  You may need to update the schemas installed with BTAHL7 to conform to the HL7 standard. To do so, see [Resolving Database Errors](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-hl7/resolving-database-errors.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The BTAHL7 engine cannot process message instances conforming to HL7 schemas that have an ambiguous schema structure. An ambiguous schema structure is one that the HL7 standard has not completely defined. Such schemas include those for message types CSU and SUR.
