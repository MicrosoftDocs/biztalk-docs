# Administration and Run Time Tools
Microsoft BizTalk Server and Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL7NoNumber](../../includes/btabtahl7nonumber-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)]) provides a set of tools for performing administrative and run time tasks, such as deployment, configuration management, administration, business-rule management, and monitoring. For more information about [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] tools, see MicrosoftBizTalk Server Help.  
  
## BizTalk Explorer  
 You use BizTalk Explorer to configure and manage projects, parties, and orchestrations. BizTalk Explorer displays the contents of the Configuration database (also known as the BizTalk Management database), showing items such as assemblies, ports, and parties (in a hierarchical tree).  
  
## BTAHL7 Configuration Explorer  
 With [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] Configuration Explorer, you can review and configure batch definitions, acknowledgment configurations, and logging data store settings. Using [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] Configuration Explorer, you can initiative activation, request, and termination of batch processing at the party level.  
  
## Business Rule Engine  
 The BizTalk Business Rule Engine (BRE) is a run-time inference engine that you can use to evaluate rules against facts and initiate actions based on the results of the evaluation.  
  
## Windows Performance Monitors  
 [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] supports the use of [!INCLUDE[btsWinNoVersion](../../includes/btswinnoversion-md.md)] performance monitors for connection status and throughout (both processes and rejected).
