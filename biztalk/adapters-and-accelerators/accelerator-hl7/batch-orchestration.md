# Batch Orchestration
Microsoft BizTalk Accelerator for HL7 ([!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)]) provides an orchestration (BatchOrchestration.dll) that you can use to process batches. This orchestration can process batches of HL7-encoded (2.X) messages and/or acknowledgments (ACKs). The orchestration is a native [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] orchestration added by [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] setup to your set of BizTalk orchestrations (as listed under Orchestrations in BizTalk Explorer).  
  
 The orchestration works with batch activation, batch termination, and batch timer messages that [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] uses to control batches. The orchestration also works with the batch control port, which is a receive port that [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] setup installs to handle batch control messages.
