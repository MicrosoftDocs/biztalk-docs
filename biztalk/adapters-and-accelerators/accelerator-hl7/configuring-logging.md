# Configuring Logging
Health care applications require complete logging of messages. Since these applications handle critical, time sensitive and monetary data, logging becomes a critical part of the application. System administrators need to be able to do the following:  
  
-   Store messages in a configured place  
  
-   Correlate the logged messages to the actual message  
  
-   List the message per partner or per process type  
  
-   Run reports at a predetermined time on these logged messages
