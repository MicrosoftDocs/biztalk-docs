# MSH Override
Before Microsoft BizTalk Accelerator for HL7 ([!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)]) routes an outbound HL7 message to a send port, you may want to replace certain values within the MSH segment. You may want to do this when the subscription for a message contains multiple send ports, and each send port should see a different value in the receiving-application field.
