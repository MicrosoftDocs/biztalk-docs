# Using Context Properties
The BizTalk Accelerator for HL7 ([!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)]) Messaging Engine and its components use context properties internally. Changing the values set by the engine for some context properties is not recommended, because it may affect the execution logic of the engine. However, you can change a large number of properties not set by the engine. You can use the context properties for creation of filter expressions on send ports (for more information, see [Setting Filter Expressions on Send Ports](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-hl7/setting-filter-expressions-on-send-ports.md)). You can also use context properties in filter expressions for orchestrations. The properties are available for filter expressions as long as a project has a reference to the global properties schemas (which [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] creates when you use one of the common templates).  
  
 The following table contains a list of [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] message context properties that the Messaging Engine uses. The engine uses many of these properties for routing. The serializer uses others for its processing. These properties have a prefix of [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)].  
  
 For more information about [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] context properties (those identified in filter expressions by a BTS prefix), see "Message Context Properties" in BizTalk Server Help. **BTS.SchemaStrongName** and **BTS.MessageType** are two properties that the [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] engine uses.  
  
 In the following table, the Is promoted and Is required columns have the following effects:  
  
- When IsPromoted is "N", [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] writes the value to the context, instead of being promoted.  
  
- When IsRequired is "N" for Boolean types, [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] writes the value only if it is true.  
  
- When IsRequired is "N" for string types, [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] writes the value if it is not blank or if a default value exists.

If the serializer does not find it, it assumes that the message is a single message. |
