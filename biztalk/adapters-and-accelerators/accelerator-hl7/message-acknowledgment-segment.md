# Message Acknowledgment Segment
The Message Acknowledgment (MSA) segment of an acknowledgment (ACK) message identifies what type of acknowledgment the system is sending, and indicates what message the ACK is acknowledging. It consists of two required segments: an acknowledgment code and a message control ID.  

## Acknowledgment Code: MSA1  
 The following table lists the available MSA1 field values indicating the result of the message receiving.  

|Value|Meaning|Description|  
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|  
|AA|Application Acknowledgment|The system has received the message and processed it with no problem.|  
|AE|Application Error|A processing problem related to the message or its structure occurred at the receiving application. The sending system should diagnose and correct the problem before attempting to resend the message.|  
|AR|Application Reject|Either a problem occurred at the receiving location related to the value in MSH9 (message type), MSH11 (processing ID), or MSH12 (version ID), in which case the sending system should diagnose and correct the problem before resending the message; or a problem occurred at the receiving system that was unrelated to the message or its structure, in which case the sending system should resend the message after an appropriate period, without change to the message.|  

## Message Control ID (MSA2)  
 The MSA2 field identifies the message that the ACK is acknowledging. Microsoft BizTalk Accelerator for HL7 ([!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)]) generates the value in MSA2 based upon the acknowledgment mode. This value enables the sending and receiving applications to keep the message and the acknowledgment synchronized. The following table lists the available values for the MSA2 field.  


|            Acknowledgment Mode            |                                                           Value in MSA2                                                            |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|               Original mode               |                  A transposed value of the value in the MSH10 (message control ID) field of the original message                   |
|   Enhanced Mode: Commit Acknowledgment    |                  A transposed value of the value in the MSH10 (message control ID) field of the original message                   |
| Enhanced Mode: Application Acknowledgment | A GUID generated by [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] for the acknowledgment |
