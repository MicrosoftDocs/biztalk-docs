# Step 4: Create the Receive Port for Accepting ADT^A03 Messages from ADT Systems Using the MLLP Adapter
You use the receive port to specify the receive location for incoming messages. Use the following procedure to create the receive port for accepting ADT^A03 messages from the ADT System using the MLLP adapter.  

## Create the receive port  

1. Open **BizTalk Server Administration**, expand **BizTalk Server Administration**, expand **BizTalk Group**, expand **Applications**, and then expand **BizTalk Application 1**.  

   > [!NOTE]
   >  The BizTalk Server Administration Console can also be opened from within Visual Studio by clicking **BizTalk Server Administration** in the **Tools** menu.  

2. Right-click **Receive Ports**, select **New**, and then select **One-way Receive Port**.  

3. For the **Name**, enter **Tutorial_1WayReceive**.  

4. Select **Apply** to bind the port, and then select **Receive Locations**.  

5. Select **New**.  

6. For the **Name**, enter **Tutorial_MLLPReceive**.  

7. In the **Transport** section, select **Type**, and then select **MLLP** from the drop-down list.  

8. Select **Configure**. In **MLLP Transport Properties**, configure the following, and then select **OK**.
