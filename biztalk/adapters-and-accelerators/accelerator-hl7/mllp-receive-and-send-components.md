# MLLP Receive and Send Components
[!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)] BizTalk Accelerator for HL7 ([!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)]) supports all [!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] native adapter types, including File, HTTP, SQL, and FTP. For HL7-encoded message receiving and sending, however, you typically use the MLLP adapter. This adapter is a TCP/IP socket adapter that uses the Minimal Lower Layer Protocol (MLLP). This protocol provides bi-directional message support and end-to-end health care application integration.  
  
 You can configure the MLLP receive adapter as either a two-way adapter or a one-way adapter. You can configure the MLLP send adapter as a two-way solicit-response send adapter, a one-way send adapter configured to receive acknowledgments (ACKs) on the same socket connection, or a one-way send adapter that does not return any messages. When you use the two-way solicit-response send MLLP adapter, you can configure the receive port to return either ACKs or response messages. For examples of MLLP send and receive adapters, see [Interrogative Tutorial](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-hl7/interrogative-tutorial.md).  
  
 Messages that [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] receives or sends on an MLLP adapter require the following wrappers:  
  
-   \<SB\> Start Block character  
  
-   \<EB\> End Block character  
  
-   \<CR\> Carriage Return Byte (optional)  
  
 MLLP adapters provide error handling for missing \<SB\> or \<EB\> wrappers, dropped connections, or timeouts. With an MLLP adapter, you can configure a limitation on the number of connections. You can use an assortment of acknowledgments with an MLLP adapter.
