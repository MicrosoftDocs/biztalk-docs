# Step 7: Sign and Build the Projects
In this step, you assign a strong name and build the project to generate an assembly that contains the resources (the schema) that you created in [Step 6: Validate the Schemas](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-hl7/step-6-validate-the-schemas.md). This also ensures that there are no compile errors in the work you have completed so far.  
  
### To sign the BTAHL7 Project  
  
1.  In Solution Explorer, right-click **BTAHL7 Project**, and then click **Properties**.  
  
2.  In the BTAHL7 Project Property Pages dialog box, click **Assembly**.  
  
3.  In the right pane, scroll down to the **Strong name** section, click the field to the right of **Assembly Key File**, and then click the ellipsis (â€¦) button.  
  
4.  In the Assembly Key File dialog box, browse to **\<*drive*\>:\Tutorial\BTAHL7V22Common\key.snk** (as created in [Step 3: Assign a Strong Name to the Assembly](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-hl7/step-3-assign-a-strong-name-to-the-assembly.md)), and then click **Open**.  
  
5.  Click **OK** to save changes.  
  
### To build the BTAHL7 Project  
  
-   In Solution Explorer, right-click **BTAHL7 Project**, and then click **Deploy**. [!INCLUDE[btsVStudio2008](../../includes/btsvstudio2008-md.md)] compiles the assembly into a DLL file and saves it in the \<*drive*\>:\Tutorial\BTAHL7V22Common\Bin\Development folder.  
  
 Proceed to [Step 8: Create a Map with BizTalk Mapper](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-hl7/step-8-create-a-map-with-biztalk-mapper.md).
