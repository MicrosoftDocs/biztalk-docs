# Step 4: Create the Receive Port for Accepting ADT Query Messages
You create a receive port to specify the location for incoming query messages sent by the Admissions, Discharge, and Transfer (ADT) system. Use the following procedure to create the receive port for accepting queries (QRY^Q01 messages) from the ADT system using the Minimal Lower Layer Protocol (MLLP) adapter.  

## Create the ADT_ReceivePort receive port  

1. Open **BizTalk Server Administration**, expand **BizTalk Server Administration**, expand **BizTalk Group**, expand **Applications**, and then expand **BizTalk Application 1**.  

2. Right-click **Receive Ports**, select **New**, and then select **Request Response Receive Port**.  

3. For the **Name**, enter **ADT_ReceivePort**.  

4. Select **Apply** to bind the port, and then select **Receive Locations**.  

5. Select **New**. 

6. For the **Name**, enter **ADT_Receive**.  

7. In the **Transport** section, select **Type**, and then select **MLLP** from the drop-down list.  

8. Select **Configure**. In **MLLP Transport Properties**, configure the following, and then select **OK**.
