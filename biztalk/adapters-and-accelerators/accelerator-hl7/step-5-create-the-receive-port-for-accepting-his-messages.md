# Step 5: Create the Receive Port for Accepting HIS Messages
In this step you create a receive port to specify the location for incoming messages sent by the Hospital Information System (HIS). Use the following procedure to create the receive port for accepting query response messages from the ADT system using the Minimal Lower Layer Protocol (MLLP) adapter.  

## Create the HIS_ReceivePort receive port  

1. Open **BizTalk Server Administration**, expand **BizTalk Server Administration**, expand **BizTalk Group**, expand **Applications**, and then expand **BizTalk Application 1**.  

2. Right-click **Receive Ports**, select **New**, and then select **One-way Receive Port**.   

3. For the **Name**, enter **HIS_ReceivePort**.  

4. Select **Apply** to bind the port, and then select **Receive Locations**.  

5. Select **New**.  

6. For the **Name**, enter **HIS_Receive**.  

7. In the **Transport** section, select **Type**, and then select **MLLP** from the drop-down list.  

8. Select **Configure**. In **MLLP Transport Properties**, configure the following, and then select **OK**.
