# Step 3: Assign a Strong Name to the Assembly
In this step, you create and assign a strong name for the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] assembly. A strong-named assembly provides several security benefits and is required in order to deploy your project in the global assembly cache (GAC). A strong name guarantees the uniqueness of the assembly by assigning a digital signature and a unique key pair. This also protects the lineage of the assembly by ensuring that no one can generate a subsequent version of the assembly. Lastly, a strong name provides a strong integrity check to guarantee that the contents of the assembly have not changed since you built it.  
  
### To assign a strong name to the assembly  
  
1.  Start **[!INCLUDE[vs2012](../../includes/vs2012-md.md)] Command Prompt**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If you have already created a strong name key, you can reuse it.  
  
2.  At the command prompt, move to**\<*drive*\>:\Tutorial\BTAHL7V22Common** (where \<*drive*\> is your installation drive letter) and then press **Enter**.  
  
3.  At the command prompt, type **sn –k key.snk**, and then press **Enter**. A message appears indicating that [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] wrote the key pair to the key file key.snk.  
  
4.  In Solution Explorer, right-click the **BTAHL7V22Common** project, and then click **Properties**.  
  
5.  In the BTAHL7V22Common Property Pages dialog box, click **Assembly**.  
  
6.  In the right pane, scroll down to the **Strong name** section, click the field to the right of **Assembly Key File**, and then click the ellipsis (…) button.  
  
7.  In the Assembly Key File dialog box, browse to **\<*drive*\>:\Tutorial\BTAHL7V22Common\key.snk**, click **Open**, and then click **OK**.  
  
8.  In Solution Explorer, right-click **BTAHL7V22Common**, and then click **Deploy**. [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] creates an assembly that you can reference from your next project.  
  
9. Repeat steps 4 through 8 for the BTAHL7V2XCommon project.  
  
 Proceed to [Step 4: Create the Schemas](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-hl7/step-4-create-the-schemas.md).
