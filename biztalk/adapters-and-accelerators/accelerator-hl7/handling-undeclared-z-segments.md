# Handling Undeclared Z Segments
There are two types of Z segments: declared Z segments and undeclared Z segments. While they are similar in that you use them for local purposes, they are very different in how you use them.  
  
 You include the definition of a declared Z segment in a message schema, and Microsoft BizTalk Accelerator for HL7 ([!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)]) uses it to process a message, just like a schema defined by the HL7 standard. No schema defines an undeclared Z segment. You include an undeclared Z segment at the end of a message, and [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] passes through without processing it against a schema. The parser and serializer do not validate it. [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] treats it as a binary large object (BLOB). The only check that [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] does on an undeclared Z segment is verifying that the BLOB does not include any existing three-character schema tag.  
  
 You include the undeclared Z segment as the third part, or Z part, of a multi-part message. The message includes the header, the body, and the Z part. The Z part has a segment ID starting with the letter "Z".  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The Zpart must always contain data. Specifying null for the stream results in an error condition. If no data is included in the Zpart, [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] inserts the word "Empty" in the Zpart. [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] uses the context property **ZPartPresent** to determine whether to serialize the Z part.  
> 
> [!CAUTION]
>  Microsoft has tested Zsegments with ANSI character sets, with the result that Zsegment behavior with ANSI characters is predictable. However, using other character sets in Zsegments may result in unpredictable behavior.
