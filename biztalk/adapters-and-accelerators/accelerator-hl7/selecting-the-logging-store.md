# Selecting the Logging Store
[!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[HL7_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/hl7-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] provides you with the option to select a combination of different logging stores, such as [!INCLUDE[btsWinNoVersion](../../includes/btswinnoversion-md.md)] Management Instrumentation (WMI), [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)], and [!INCLUDE[btsWinNoVersion](../../includes/btswinnoversion-md.md)] Event Log.  
  
 You use the [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] Configuration Explorer to configure the logging store.  
  
 Use the following procedures to open [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] Configuration Explorer and select the logging store.  
  
### To open BTAHL7 Configuration Explorer  
  
-   Click **Start**, click **Programs**, click **Microsoft BizTalk \<version\> Accelerator for HL7**, and then click **BTAHL7 Configuration Explorer**.  
  
### To select the  logging store  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] Configuration Explorer, on the **Global Settings** tab, do the following:  
  
    |Use this|To do this|  
    |--------------|----------------|  
    |**WMI**|Select this option if you want to generate WMI notifications for BTAHL7.|  
    |**SQL**|Select this option if you want to use [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] as your  logging store. **Note:**  BTAHL7 automatically creates the tables required for  logging if they do not exist.|  
    |**SQL Server**|Type the [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] name. This is required when you select the **SQL** option. The maximum allowed length is 64 characters.<br /><br /> The default server and database name is the configured BTAHL7 database.|  
    |**Database name**|Type the [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] database name. This is required when you select the **SQL** option. The maximum allowed length is 128 characters.|  
    |**Event  Log**|Select this option if you want to use the [!INCLUDE[btsWinNoVersion](../../includes/btswinnoversion-md.md)] Event Log as your  logging store. You use the [!INCLUDE[btsWinNoVersion](../../includes/btswinnoversion-md.md)] Event Viewer to view event messages.|  
  
2.  Click **Save**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  The locale of the events logged by the  Logging event broker depend on the locale of the  Logging Service account.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  When changing the  Logging Service account password, you should first change the password in [!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[btsAD](../../includes/btsad-md.md)] directory service, and then restart the  Logging Service after changing the  Logging Service password on every server running it.
