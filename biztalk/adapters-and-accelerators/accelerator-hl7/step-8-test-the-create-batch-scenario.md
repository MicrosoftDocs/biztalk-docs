# Step 8: Test the Create-Batch Scenario
In this step, you test the Create-Batch scenario by dropping test instances of the messages you want to batch into the source Tutorial_BTAHL7Pickup folder. The send port that you set up picks up the message from the source folder and sends it; the receive port receives it; and the receive pipeline processes it and drops it into the destination Tutorial_BTAHL7Drop folder.  
  
### To test the Create-Batch scenario  
  
1.  Using [!INCLUDE[btsWinNoVersion](../../includes/btswinnoversion-md.md)] Explorer, browse to the **\<*drive*\>:\Batching Tutorial\Instances** folder.  
  
2.  Select **CreateBatchMessage1.txt**, and **CreateBatchMessage2.txt**, right-click them, and then click **Copy**.  
  
3.  Using [!INCLUDE[btsWinNoVersion](../../includes/btswinnoversion-md.md)] Explorer, browse to the **\<*drive*\>:\Program Files\Microsoft BizTalk \<version\> Accelerator for HL7\SDK\End-to-End Tutorial\Tutorial_BTAHL7Pickup** folder.  
  
4.  Right-click the folder, and then click **Paste**.  
  
### To verify the results of the Create-Batch scenario  
  
1.  Using [!INCLUDE[btsWinNoVersion](../../includes/btswinnoversion-md.md)] Explorer, browse to the **\<*drive*\>:\Program Files\Microsoft BizTalk \<version\> Accelerator for HL7\SDK\End-to-End Tutorial\Tutorial_BatchACKDrop** folder. After a short period, you should see the processed instance of the acknowledgment batch appear in the folder. If it does not appear, check the [!INCLUDE[btsWinNoVersion](../../includes/btswinnoversion-md.md)] Event Viewer for error messages. The file should have the name \<*Guid*\>.txt. This batch should contain the two acknowledgments generated upon receiving the two messages that were originally sent. This batch should have the following fields:  
  
    |FHS.5|BHS.5|BTS.1|FTS.1|  
    |-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|  
    |Tutorial_BatchSource|Tutorial_BatchSource|2|1|  
  
     The acknowledgments within the batch should have the following fields:  
  
    |MSH.9|MSA.2|MSA.1|MSH.3|MSH.5|  
    |-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|  
    |ACK^A03^ACK|Msg01|AA|Tutorial_BatchDest|Tutorial_BatchSource|  
    |ACK^A03^ACK|Msg02|AA|Tutorial_BatchDest|Tutorial_BatchSource|  
  
2.  Using [!INCLUDE[btsWinNoVersion](../../includes/btswinnoversion-md.md)] Explorer, browse to the **\<*drive*\>:\Program Files\Microsoft BizTalk \<version\> Accelerator for HL7\SDK\End-to-End Tutorial\Tutorial_BatchMsgDrop** folder. After an hour, you should see the processed instance of the message batch appear in the folder. If it does not appear, check the [!INCLUDE[btsWinNoVersion](../../includes/btswinnoversion-md.md)] Event Viewer for error messages. The file should have the name \<*Guid*\>.txt. This batch should contain the two messages that were originally sent. This batch should have the following fields:  
  
    |FHS.5|BHS.5|BTS.1|FTS.1|  
    |-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|  
    |Tutorial_BatchDest|Tutorial_BatchDest|2|1|  
  
     The messages within the batch should have the following fields:  
  
    |MSH.9|MSH.10|MSH.3|MSH.5|  
    |-----------|------------|-----------|-----------|  
    |ADT^A03|Msg01|Tutorial_BatchSource|Tutorial_BatchDest|  
    |ADT^A03|Msg02|Tutorial_BatchSource|Tutorial_BatchDest|  
  
     The batch is wrapped in two sets of headers and trailers specific to batches:  
  
    -   A file header and trailer (FHS and FTS), which are used to enclose a file that can include multiple batches. Note the file-receiving application (**Tutorial_BatchDest**) in the FHS5 field and the file creation date/time in FHS7. Note the file batch count (the number of batches in the file) in FTS2 (1).  
  
    -   A batch header and trailer (BHS and BTS), which are used to enclose each batch. Note the file receiving application and batch creation date/time, as in the FHS, and the batch message count (2) in BTS2.
