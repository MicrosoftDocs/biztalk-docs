> [!TIP]
> The hardware requirements listed are the minimum. Every environment is different and there's a very good chance that your environment may need more. See [Recommendations for Installing, Sizing, Deploying, and Maintaining a BizTalk Server Solution](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/666.recommendations-for-installing-sizing-deploying-and-maintaining-a-biztalk-server-solution.aspx)

## Install HL7

### Before you begin

* The HL7 accelerator install files are in `BizTalk Server <version>\BizTalk Accelerators` on the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion_md](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] ISO, download location, network share, or wherever you downloaded the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion_md](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] program.
* The user installing and configuring [!INCLUDE[HL7_CurrentVersion_abbrev_md](../../includes/hl7-currentversion-abbrev-md.md)] must be a member of the BizTalk Administrators group, and a member of the Administrators group on the SQL Server where the [!INCLUDE[HL7_CurrentVersion_abbrev_md](../../includes/hl7-currentversion-abbrev-md.md)] data is stored.
* The computer and signed-in user must have access to the primary domain controller (PDC). If the setup fails to access the PDC, then the installation fails, and won’t continue.
* BizTalk Server should have the basic components installed and configured, including a 32-bit BizTalkServerApplication host with standard out of the box adapters, Enterprise Single Sign-on (SSO), the Group, and Runtime.
* The default host should be configured as a FILE receive handler.
* Read the [installation known issues](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-hl7/installation-known-issues.md).
* [!INCLUDE[HL7_CurrentVersion_abbrev_md](../../includes/hl7-currentversion-abbrev-md.md)] is available in Enterprise and Standard Editions. The following table shows the compatibility between the different editions of [!INCLUDE[HL7_CurrentVersion_abbrev_md](../../includes/hl7-currentversion-abbrev-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)].


  | [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] edition | Compatible edition of [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL7NoNumber](../../includes/btabtahl7nonumber-md.md)] |
  |---|---|
  | Enterprise Edition | Enterprise Edition  |
  | Standard Edition  | Enterprise or Standard Edition  |
  | Developer Edition  | Enterprise Edition  |

### Default installation

1. Run the [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL7NoNumber_md](../../includes/btabtahl7nonumber-md.md)] (A4HL7) **setup.exe** as Administrator.
