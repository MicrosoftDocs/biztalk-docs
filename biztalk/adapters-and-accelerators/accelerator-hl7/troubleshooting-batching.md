Addresses issues related to [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] batching.  
  
## Error activating batch  
  
### Symptom  
 Unable to activate a batch. You get a general network error.  
  
**Possible Cause** : [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] was restarted, but [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] Configuration Explorer was not.  
  
**Resolution** : Restart [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] Configuration Explorer.  
  
## Messages are not batched when the target namespace is not the default  
  
### Symptom  
 [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] is not batching messages.  
  
**Possible Cause** : Source and destination parties are not in the same schema namespace.
