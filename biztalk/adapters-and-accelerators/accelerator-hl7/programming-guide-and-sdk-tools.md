# Programming guide and SDK tools
This Software Development Kit (SDK) provides information for developers who are creating applications using any of the tools in Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL7NoNumber](../../includes/btabtahl7nonumber-md.md)], the public application programming interfaces (API), or the samples and utilities provided in the BTAHL7 SDK.  
  
## Tips for using Help in a developer environment  
 BTAHL7 Help contains features that you can use to display the developer documentation in your preferred language and to link between BTAHL7 Help and Visual Studio Help.  
  
### Using language filtering  
 The BTAHL7 [!INCLUDE[btsDotNet](../../includes/btsdotnet-md.md)] Class Reference provides signatures and code examples in multiple programming languages. The following tags denote the language-specific information:  
  
 **[** [!INCLUDE[btsCSharp](../../includes/btscsharp-md.md)] **]**  
  
 **[** [!INCLUDE[btsVBNoVersion](../../includes/btsvbnoversion-md.md)] **]**  
  
 **[C++]**  
  
 **[** [!INCLUDE[btsJScript](../../includes/btsjscript-md.md)] **]**  
  
 You can customize your view of the content in the reference pages to display only information in your preferred programming language. To select a custom language, use the **Language Filter** button in the upper-left corner of this page. Once enabled, language filtering persists until it is changed. You can see that language filtering is enabled on a page, because the name of the language follows the title in the blue bar at the top of the page.  
  
### Linking between BTAHL7 Help and Microsoft Visual Studio Help  
 When a member is inherited from the [!INCLUDE[btsDotNetFramework](../../includes/btsdotnetframework-md.md)] Base Class Library, two links are provided, as shown in the following example:  
  
|Method|Description|  
|-|-|  
|![Icon for the method.](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-hl7/media/protmethod.gif "protmethod") Finalize (inherited from **System.Object**)|For additional information about the System namespace, see [System Namespace class](/dotnet/api/system).|  
  
 If you are viewing BTAHL7 in [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] or in the [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] documentation, the link in the left column goes to the exact member page. If you are viewing BTAHL7 Help outside of [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)], use the link in the right column to go to the System namespace page in the MSDN Library. Note that the link will not go to the specific member page.
