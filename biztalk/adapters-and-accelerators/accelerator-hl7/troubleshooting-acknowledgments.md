# Troubleshooting Acknowledgments
Addresses issues related to [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] acknowledgments.  
  
## Acknowledgments are not generated  
 There are several potential causes for acknowledgments (ACKs) not being generated or received. Review the following list of potential problems.  
  
### Symptom  
 Acknowledgments are not generated when you update party information in [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] Configuration Explorer to generate acknowledgments.  
  
**Possible cause** : [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] caches and refreshes party configuration information every 15 minutes.  
  
**Resolution** : Wait for at least 15 minutes for the cache to refresh, or restart [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] for changes to take effect immediately.  
  
### Symptom  
 [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] does not generate ACKs and event errors appear in the event log.  
  
**Possible cause** : An ACK cannot be generated when a batch in/batch out message contains an empty FHS11 field.  
  
**Resolution** : Ensure that your messages have a correctly formatted and populated FHS11 field.  
  
### Symptom  
 Your application cannot generate or receive an ACK.  
  
**Possible cause** : Incorrect information in the MSH3 field of your message prevents [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] from sending the message ACKs.  
  
**Resolution** : Ensure that your messages have a correctly formatted and populated MSH3 field.  
  
## Acknowledgments are suspended or not routed to the send party  
  
### Symptom  
 [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] sends messages to a two-way adapter without generating acknowledgments.  
  
**Possible cause** : The message subscription is not configured correctly.  
  
**Resolution** : Ensure that message subscriptions are present and configured correctly.  
  
## Suspended acknowledgments  
  
### Symptom  
 Acknowledgments are suspended with the error message "Delimiter found in the field" when you have configured the party to have encoding characters containing delimiter characters such as @-!$.  
  
**Possible cause** : The message contains characters such as a period (.) or a hyphen (-). When generating the ACKs, [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL71.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtahl71-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] includes "." and "-" for the timestamp value.  
  
**Resolution** : Disable validation in the send pipeline to avoid these errors.  
  
## BizTalk Server generates an error about missing ACK when using 2-way MLLP adapter  
  
### Symptom  
 You get the following or similar error in the Event Log:  
  
 "Unable to receive ACK from network due to error "Exception from HRESULT: 0xC0C01662""  
  
**Possible cause** : You are using 1-way receive and 2-way send port, so BizTalk does not have a corresponding Receive port to return the message received from the 2-way Send port.  
  
**Resolution** : This is by design, and you can ignore the error message.
