# Operational logging, message batching, validation and asknowledgment settings
Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btaBTAHL7NoNumber](../../includes/btabtahl7nonumber-md.md)] encompasses a server and series of tools for enterprise application integration (EAI), automating business processes, and facilitating interactions with business partners. Built on the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] platform, BTAHL7 promotes medical application integration for any facility using the HL7 standard. HL7 contains standards for exchanging, integrating, and retrieving electronic information in clinical practice and management.  
  
 Interface user analysts configure trading partners, message acknowledgments, message batching, and other details that your business process requires.  
  
 This section provides conceptual and procedural information that enables you to effectively monitor and maintain your BTAHL7 application environment.
