# Tutorial 3: Hosting the Echo Adapter in IIS
This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions for hosting the Echo Adapter developed in [Tutorial 1: Develop the Echo Adapter](../../adapters-and-accelerators/wcf-lob-adapter-sdk/tutorial-1-develop-the-echo-adapter.md). More specifically, the steps show how you can host the adapter in Internet Information Services (IIS) by using the [!INCLUDE[afsvcdevwizshort](../../includes/afsvcdevwizshort-md.md)]. You will also use the Business Data Catalog feature in SharePoint to call the EchoGreetings operation of the IIS-hosted adapter, and then display the results in a Web Part.  
  
> [!TIP]
>  The Echo Adapter, test code, and installation script are included with your BizTalk installation files at `\BizTalk Server\ASDK_x86\Program Files\WCF LOB Adapter SDK\Documents\Samples` or `\BizTalk Server\ASDK_x64\Program Files\WCF LOB Adapter SDK\Documents\Samples`.
