# Tutorial 2: Consume the Echo Adapter from .NET
This section gives the steps for consuming the inbound and outbound operations exposed by the Echo adapter from .NET. The Echo adapter was developed in [Tutorial 1: Develop the Echo Adapter](../../adapters-and-accelerators/wcf-lob-adapter-sdk/tutorial-1-develop-the-echo-adapter.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The Echo Adapter and test code is included with your BizTalk installation files at `\BizTalk Server\ASDK_x86\Program Files\WCF LOB Adapter SDK\Documents\Samples` or `\BizTalk Server\ASDK_x64\Program Files\WCF LOB Adapter SDK\Documents\Samples`.
