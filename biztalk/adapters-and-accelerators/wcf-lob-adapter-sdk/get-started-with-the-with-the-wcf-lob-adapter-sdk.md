## Prerequisites

The [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)] is intended for developers who need to integrate dynamic and complex line-of-business systems as part of an enterprise application integration effort.

 To create an adapter using the [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)], we suggest being experienced with the following technologies:
