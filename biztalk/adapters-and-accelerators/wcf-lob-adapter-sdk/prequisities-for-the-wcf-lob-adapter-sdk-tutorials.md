  Before starting the tutorials, it will be helpful if you have reviewed the conceptual topics of this SDK, and have a general understanding of channels in [!INCLUDE[nextref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/nextref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)], including the types within the **T:Microsoft.ServiceModel.Channels** and **T:Microsoft.ServiceModel.Channels.Common** namespaces.  For more information about channels, see the [Channel Model Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms729840.aspx).
