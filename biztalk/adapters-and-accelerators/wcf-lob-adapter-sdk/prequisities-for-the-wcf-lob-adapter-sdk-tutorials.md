- Internet Information Services (IIS)  
  
- [!INCLUDE[btsDotNetFramework_md](../../includes/btsdotnetframework-md.md)]
  
- [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)] (available with your BizTalk Server installation files, and named ASDK_x64 and ASDK_x86)  
  
  To complete Tutorial 3, you must have the following software installed on your computer.

The completed Echo Adapter is included with your BizTalk installation files at `\BizTalk Server\ASDK_x86\Program Files\WCF LOB Adapter SDK\Documents\Samples` or `\BizTalk Server\ASDK_x64\Program Files\WCF LOB Adapter SDK\Documents\Samples`.
  
## Prerequisites  
 The tutorials assume that you are familiar with the following:  
  
- Object-oriented software design and development

- .NET Framework  
  
  Before starting the tutorials, it will be helpful if you have reviewed the conceptual topics of this SDK, and have a general understanding of channels in [!INCLUDE[nextref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/nextref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)], including the types within the **T:Microsoft.ServiceModel.Channels** and **T:Microsoft.ServiceModel.Channels.Common** namespaces.  For more information about channels, see the [Channel Model Overview](/dotnet/framework/wcf/extending/channel-model-overview).
