# Microsoft Windows Communication Foundation Line of Business Adapter SDK documentation
The [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)] documentation includes resources to help you develop, deploy, and use adapters created with the [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)].  

## About the SDK  
 The [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)] is a collection of a run-time engine and tools that help adapter developers create service-oriented interfaces to existing LOB systems by using WCF. The goal of the SDK is to facilitate uniform development of reusable, metadata-oriented, WCF-based adapters that enable enterprise applications, databases, and messaging platforms to integrate with each other.  
  
 This WCF-based SDK surfaces an adapter to an LOB system as a WCF binding. For an adapter consumer, the adapter can be accessed like a typical WCF service; the consumer does not have to learn a new programming model. The same adapter developed can be reused in multiple .NET applications including custom .NET applications, [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], SharePoint, and Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) through an adapter developerâ€“provided ADO.NET shim. In addition, the adapter provides metadata browse, search, and retrieval functionality; the adapter consumer can selectively generate WCF contracts that reflect live type modeling of the LOB system.  
 
## Readme
![Community resources icon](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-database/media/community.gif "Community") [Readme and privacy](../../adapters-and-accelerators/wcf-lob-adapter-sdk/readme-and-privacy-in-the-wcf-lob-adapter-sdk.md) describes the components included with the SDK, and also your explains the privacy options. 

## Install
![Getting started icon](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-database/media/f397b0c1-6fe1-4247-a868-9efcab4a5f55.gif "f397b0c1-6fe1-4247-a868-9efcab4a5f55") [Install the WCF LOB Adapter SDK](../../adapters-and-accelerators/wcf-lob-adapter-sdk/install-the-wcf-lob-adapter-sdk.md) lists the steps to install and uninstall the SDK, remove custom adapters, and do a silent installation. 

## Get started
![Getting started icon](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-database/media/f397b0c1-6fe1-4247-a868-9efcab4a5f55.gif "f397b0c1-6fe1-4247-a868-9efcab4a5f55") [Get started with the with the WCF LOB Adapter SDK](../../adapters-and-accelerators/wcf-lob-adapter-sdk/get-started-with-the-with-the-wcf-lob-adapter-sdk.md) includes some good information for users who are new to the [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)], including conceptual reading, and some tutorials. 
  
## Plan and design 
![Adapter Architecture icon](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-database/media/4af6a1c5-948f-4bf7-bb56-4d63a47f4825.gif "4af6a1c5-948f-4bf7-bb56-4d63a47f4825") [Plan and design an adapter using the WCF LOB Adapter SDK](../../adapters-and-accelerators/wcf-lob-adapter-sdk/plan-and-design-an-adapter-using-the-wcf-lob-adapter-sdk.md) described when to use an adapter, a channel, or a service. Also read about the supported messaging patterns, designing a URI, understanding transactions, and more.

## Develop and create
![Adapter Development icon](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-database/media/44af70c9-cab1-4201-9912-d115cbc7e16f.gif "44af70c9-cab1-4201-9912-d115cbc7e16f") [Develop or create your adapter using the WCF LOB Adapter SDK](../../adapters-and-accelerators/wcf-lob-adapter-sdk/develop-or-create-your-adapter-using-the-wcf-lob-adapter-sdk.md) lists some best practices, provides guidance on versioning, authentication, and more.

## GAC and deploy
![Adapter Samples icon](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/media/2e8eba6a-6ba1-431e-9e0a-f0f45e036e8a.gif "2e8eba6a-6ba1-431e-9e0a-f0f45e036e8a") After you create your adapter, the next step is to add it to the GAC, update the machine.config, and create a deployment package. [Deploy adapter using the WCF LOB Adapter SDK](../../adapters-and-accelerators/wcf-lob-adapter-sdk/deploy-adapter-using-the-wcf-lob-adapter-sdk.md) includes this information.

## Troubleshoot
![Adapter Troubleshooting icon](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-database/media/383a7392-2eb9-485d-b6a8-0187cd5c709d.gif "383a7392-2eb9-485d-b6a8-0187cd5c709d") [Troubleshoot adapter created using the WCF LOB Adapter SDK](../../adapters-and-accelerators/wcf-lob-adapter-sdk/troubleshoot-adapter-created-using-the-wcf-lob-adapter-sdk.md) lists the steps to enable tracing, use performance counters, and generating WSDL.
