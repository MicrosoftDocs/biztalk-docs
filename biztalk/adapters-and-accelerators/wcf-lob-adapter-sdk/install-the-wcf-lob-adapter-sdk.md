#### Remove custom adapters after uninstalling the WCF LOB Adapter SDK  

 If you have developed any custom adapters using the [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)], and you have registered these adapters on your computer, you must also complete the following procedure.  
  
1.  Remove the custom adapter from the global assembly cache (GAC).  
  
    1.  Open a **Visual Studio command prompt**.  
  
    2.  Remove the custom **adapter .dll** from the GAC using **command gacutil /u**.  
  
2.  Remove the references to the custom adapter binding from machine.config  
  
    1.  Go to the machine.config file under \<*system drive*\>:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\\<version\>\CONFIG.  
  
    2.  Open the file by using a text editor.  
  
    3.  Search for the element bindingExtensions, client and bindingElementExtensions under system.serviceModel\extensions.  
  
    4.  Remove the WCF binding that pertains to your custom adapter.  
  
## Do a silent installation  
 A silent installation is ideal for test scenarios or as part of a large-scale enterprise deployment. [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)] provides command line parameters that you can use with AdapterFramework.msi to perform a silent installation.  
 
> [!NOTE]
>  To perform silent installation, you should be an Administrator on the computer. 

  
1.  Open a command prompt as administrator.  
  
2.  Type the following:
  
    ```  
    AdapterFramework.msi /quiet MUOPTIN=”Yes”  
    ```  
  
    Use the following command line options in conjunction with AdapterFramework.msi:  
  
    * Use `/quiet` to install [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)] silently.  
  
    * Use MUOPTIN=”Yes”&#124;”No” to indicate if the [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)] should check for updates with Microsoft Update.  
    
        When set to Yes, [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)] checks for updates through Microsoft Update. When set to no [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)] does not check for updates with Microsoft Update.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  To display additional options for command line installation, type `AdapterFramework.msi /?`at the command prompt.
