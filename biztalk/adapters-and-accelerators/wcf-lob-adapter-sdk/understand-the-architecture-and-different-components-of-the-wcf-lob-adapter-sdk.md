# Understand the architecture and different components of the WCF LOB Adapter SDK
Read about the [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)] to help understand the different components, and the role of WCF.  

The [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)] is a collection of tools and components that provide a consistent framework for developing reusable, metadata-rich adapters for line-of-business systems. Adapters written using the [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)] are surfaced as custom WCF bindings and can be consumed by a WCF-capable client.  
  
## Features and components overview
[What Is the Windows Communication Foundation Line of Business Adapter SDK](what-is-the-windows-communication-foundation-line-of-business-adapter-sdk.md) provides an overview of the features and components that make up the SDK, and describes the metadata, connection management, and describes the common WCF terms.

## Role of WCF  
[Read how WCF is used by the WCF LOB Adapter SDK](read-how-wcf-is-used-by-the-wcf-lob-adapter-sdk.md) explains the relationship with the SDK and WCF.

## Architecture Overview  
[Architecture overview](architecture-overview-of-the-wcf-lob-adapter-sdk.md) descrbied the internal architecture and the main components of WCF LOB Adapter SDK.
 
## Connection, handler, metadata, custom, and core components
[Key Components of the WCF LOB Adapter SDK](key-components-of-the-wcf-lob-adapter-sdk.md) describes these different components.
