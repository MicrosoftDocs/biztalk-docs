# Common developer tasks for the WCF LOB Adapter SDK

## Overview

Adapter developers design and develop WCF-based adapters to line-of-business systems using the [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)] API and tools as well as the Microsoft .NET Framework.  
  
 To help adapter developers be as effective as possible, the following lists provide links for tutorials and general information about developing adapters using [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)].  
  
**Concepts**  
  
-   [What Is the Windows Communication Foundation Line of Business Adapter SDK](what-is-the-windows-communication-foundation-line-of-business-adapter-sdk.md)  
  

**Development**  
  
 
-   [Key Components of the WCF LOB Adapter SDK](key-components-of-the-wcf-lob-adapter-sdk.md) 
  
-   [Extending the Channel Layer](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/wcf/extending/extending-the-channel-layer)  
  

**Tutorials**  
  
-   [Tutorials to learn the WCF LOB Adapter SDK](tutorials-to-learn-the-wcf-lob-adapter-sdk.md) 
  
    To the adapter consumer, consuming an adapter is the same as consuming a WCF service. Get started learning about WCF at [Developing Service-Oriented Applications with WCF)](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/wcf).
  
    The following topics may be useful for adapter consumers:  
  
-   [What Is Windows Communication Foundation](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/wcf/whats-wcf)  
  
-   [Fundamental Windows Communication Foundation Concepts](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/wcf/fundamental-concepts)  
  
-   [Hosting Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/wcf/hosting-services)  
  
-   [Building Clients](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/wcf/building-clients)
