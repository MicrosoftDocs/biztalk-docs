# FileAct Adapter Supporting Information Transfer
The FileAct adapter permits the optional transfer of supporting information with files. This information is transferred at the discretion of the application. The adapter does not do any special processing of this information on the originating side except to validate that it is in the correct format. The elements which comprise supporting information include:  
  
-   File description and file information  
  
-   Transfer description and transfer information  
  
-   Acknowledgement description and acknowledgement information  
  
-   Rejection description and reject information  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  One of the components of file information defines compression and decompression. Compression and decompression are the responsibility of the application, not the adapter.
