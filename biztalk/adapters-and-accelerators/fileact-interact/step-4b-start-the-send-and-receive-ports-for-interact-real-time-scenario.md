# Step 4B: Start the Send Ports and Receive Ports for the InterAct Real-Time Scenario
Before you begin this step, you must complete [Step 4A: Start the SWIFTNet Service](../../adapters-and-accelerators/fileact-interact/step-4a-start-the-swiftnet-service.md).  
  
### To start the send ports and receive ports  
  
1.  Start **BizTalk Server Administration**.  
  
2.  In the console tree, expand the BizTalk group, and then expand the BizTalk application where you created the send ports.  
  
3.  For each of the following send ports, right-click the send port, and then click **Start**:  
  
    -   **Tutorial_IA_SendResponseToReceiver**  
  
    -   **Tutorial_IA_SendResponseToSender**  
  
    -   **Tutorial_IA_SendRequest_RealTime**  
  
4.  In the console tree, expand the BizTalk group, and then expand the BizTalk application where you created the receive locations.  
  
5.  For each of the following receive locations, right-click the receive location, and then click **Enable**:  
  
    -   **Tutorial_IA_InputRequest_RealTime**  
  
    -   **Tutorial_IA_HandleRequestOneWay_RealTime**
