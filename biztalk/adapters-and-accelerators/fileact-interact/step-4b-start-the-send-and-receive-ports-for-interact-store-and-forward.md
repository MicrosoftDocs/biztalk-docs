# Step 4B: Start the Send Ports and Receive Ports for the InterAct Store and Forward Scenario
Before you begin this step, you must complete [Step 4A: Start the SWIFTNet Service for the InterAct Store and Forward Scenario](../../adapters-and-accelerators/fileact-interact/step-4a-start-the-swiftnet-service-for-the-interact-store-and-forward-scenario.md).  
  
### To start the send ports and receive ports  
  
1.  Start **BizTalk Server Administration**.  
  
2.  In the console tree, expand the BizTalk group, and then expand the BizTalk application where you created the send ports.  
  
3.  For each of the following send ports, right-click the send port, and then click **Start**:  
  
    -   **Tutorial_IA_SendResponseToReceiver**  
  
    -   **Tutorial_IA_SendResponseToSender**  
  
    -   **Tutorial_IA_SendRequest_SnF**  
  
4.  In the console tree, expand the BizTalk group, and then expand the BizTalk application where you created the receive locations.
