# Step 4D: Test a Valid Instance for the InterAct Store and Forward (Pull) Scenario
Before you begin this step, you must complete [Step 4C: Create a Test Instance for the InterAct Store and Forward (Pull) Scenario](../../adapters-and-accelerators/fileact-interact/step-4c-create-a-test-instance-for-interact-store-and-forward-pull-scenario.md).  
  
### To test a valid instance  
  
1.  Drop the file ExchangeReqSimple.xml into c:\SWIFTAdapterTutorial\Interact\InputRequest_SnF.  
  
2.  Verify that after a moment, the ExchangeReqSimple.xml file disappears from the folder.  
  
3.  Drop the file acquirequeue.xml into c:\SWIFTAdapterTutorial\Interact\PullRequest.  
  
4.  Browse to C:\SWIFTAdapterTutorial\Interact\PullResponse Verify that Sw:HandleRequest is in the folder.  
  
5.  Open the Sw:HandleRequest message in a text editor, such as Notepad, and verify that the payload section is the same as in the file ExchangeReqSimple.xml.
