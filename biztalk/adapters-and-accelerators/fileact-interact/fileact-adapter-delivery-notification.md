# FileAct Adapter Delivery Notification
After verifying the completion of receipt (including signature and digest verification) as indicated in the message request, the FileAct adapter transmits the appropriate delivery notification to the sender.  
  
 Likewise, when the FileAct adapter receives a delivery notification is received, it transmits the proper response.
