# SWIFT Receive Adapter Synchronous and Deferred Modes
SWIFTNet Link (SNL) server applications can operate in two different modes: synchronous and deferred mode. In synchronous mode, the server application sends a business response back to the client application. In deferred mode, the server application sends a technical acknowledgement back to the client application.  
  
 The following figure shows the sequence.

 The following figure shows a high level representation of the receive side.
