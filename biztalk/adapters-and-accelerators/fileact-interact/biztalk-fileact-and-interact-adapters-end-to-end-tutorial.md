# BizTalk FileAct and InterAct Adapters End-to-End Tutorial
The MicrosoftÂ® [!INCLUDE[swift_adapter](../../includes/swift-adapter-md.md)] End-to-End Tutorial provides specific information about how you can use [!INCLUDE[swift_adapter](../../includes/swift-adapter-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] to set up real-time and store and forward message exchange scenarios.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[swift_adapter](../../includes/swift-adapter-md.md)] End-To-End Tutorial provides four separate scenarios that include detailed steps in the form of tutorials for each type of solution. Before you begin these tutorials, you should understand the fundamental concepts surrounding BizTalk Server, and be familiar with the SWIFT Alliance Gateway (SAG) documentation.  
  
 The A4SWIFT end-to-end tutorial provides you with detailed steps to configure real-time and store-and-forward scenarios with both the FileAct and InterAct adapters for A4Swift. For each of the scenarios, you will do the following:  
  
-   Configure the SWIFT adapter  
  
-   Configure the SWIFTNet paramfile  
  
-   Create send ports and receive ports  
  
-   Test the scenario  
  
 In this tutorial, you will play two roles: Sender and Receiver. You will create ports that send messages and receive them.
