# Step 4C: Create a Test Instance for the InterAct Real-Time Scenario
Before you begin this step, you must complete [Step 4B: Start the Send Ports and Receive Ports for the InterAct Real-Time Scenario](../../adapters-and-accelerators/fileact-interact/step-4b-start-the-send-and-receive-ports-for-interact-real-time-scenario.md).  
  
### To create a test instance  
  
1.  Open a new file in a text editor, such as Notepad, and paste the following:  
  
    ```  
    <SwInt-ExchangeRequest>  
    <SwInt-Request>  
    <SwInt-RequestPayload>  
    Get Well soon  
    </SwInt-RequestPayload>  
    </SwInt-Request>  
    </SwInt-ExchangeRequest>  
    ```  
  
2.  Save the file with the name **ExchangeReqSimple.xml**.
