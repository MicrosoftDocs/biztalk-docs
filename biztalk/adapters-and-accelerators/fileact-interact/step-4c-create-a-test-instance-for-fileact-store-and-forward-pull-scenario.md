# Step 4C: Create a Test Instance for the FileAct Store and Forward (Pull) Scenario
Before you begin this step, you must complete [Step 4B: Start the Send Ports and Receive Ports for the FileAct Store and Forward (Pull) Scenario](../../adapters-and-accelerators/fileact-interact/step-4b-start-send-and-receive-ports-for-fileact-store-and-forward-scenario.md).  
  
### To create a test instance  
  
1.  Open a new file in a text editor, such as Notepad, and paste the following:  
  
    ```  
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>  
    <Sw-ExchangeFileRequest>  
    <Sw-FileRequest>  
    <Sw-FileOpRequest>  
    <Sw-PutFileRequest>  
    <Sw-PhysicalName>%PhysicalFolderName%\sample_put.txt</Sw-PhysicalName>  
    </Sw-PutFileRequest>  
    </Sw-FileOpRequest>  
    </Sw-FileRequest>  
    </Sw-ExchangeFileRequest>  
  
    ```  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  You must replace *%PhysicalFolderName%* with the actual folder name which you configured in the FILEACT receive location.  
  
2.  Save the File with the name ExchangeReqSimple.xml.  
  
3.  Open a new file in a text editor, such as Notepad, and paste the following:  
  
    ```  
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>  
    <Sw-ExchangeSnFRequest>  
    <Sw-SnFRequest>  
    <Sw-SnFOpRequest>  
    <Sw-AcquireSnFRequest>  
    <SwInt-Queue Type the queue name, based on your provisioning with SWIFT </SwInt-Queue>  
    <Sw-SessionMode>Pull</Sw-SessionMode>  
    <Sw-ForceAcquire>TRUE</Sw-ForceAcquire>  
    <Sw-OrderBy>InterAct</Sw-OrderBy>  
    <Sw-RecoveryMode>TRUE</Sw-RecoveryMode>  
    </Sw-AcquireSnFRequest>  
    </Sw-SnFOpRequest>  
    </Sw-SnFRequest>  
    </Sw-ExchangeSnFRequest>  
  
    ```  
  
4.  Save the File with the name acquirequeue.xml.
