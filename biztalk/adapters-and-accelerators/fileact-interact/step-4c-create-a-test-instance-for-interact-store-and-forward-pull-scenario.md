# Step 4C: Create a Test Instance for the InterAct Store and Forward (Pull) Scenario
Before you begin this step, you must complete [Step 3B: Bind the orchestration with dynamic send port for InterAct Store and Forward (Pull) Scenario](../../adapters-and-accelerators/fileact-interact/step-3b-bind-orchestration-with-dynamic-send-port-for-interact-scenario.md).  
  
### To create a test instance  
  
1.  Open a new file in a text editor, such as Notepad, and paste the following:  
  
    ```  
    SwInt-ExchangeRequest>  
    <SwInt-Request>  
    <SwInt-RequestPayload>  
    Get Well soon  
    </SwInt-RequestPayload>  
    </SwInt-Request>  
    </SwInt-ExchangeRequest>  
  
    ```  
  
2.  Save the File with the name ExchangeReqSimple.xml.  
  
3.  Open a new file in a text editor, such as Notepad, and paste the following:  
  
    ```  
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>  
    <Sw-ExchangeSnFRequest>  
    <Sw-SnFRequest>  
    <Sw-SnFOpRequest>  
    <Sw-AcquireSnFRequest>  
    <SwInt-Queue>ptsguspp_genericfa!x</SwInt-Queue>  
    <Sw-SessionMode>Pull</Sw-SessionMode>  
    <Sw-ForceAcquire>TRUE</Sw-ForceAcquire>  
    <Sw-OrderBy>FileAct</Sw-OrderBy>  
    <Sw-RecoveryMode>TRUE</Sw-RecoveryMode>  
    </Sw-AcquireSnFRequest>  
    </Sw-SnFOpRequest>  
    </Sw-SnFRequest>  
    </Sw-ExchangeSnFRequest>  
  
    ```  
  
4.  Save the File with the name acquirequeue.xml.
