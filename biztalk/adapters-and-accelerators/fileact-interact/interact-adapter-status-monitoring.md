# InterAct Adapter Status Monitoring
SWIFTNet Link (SNL-C) retains a local status about SWIFTNet store and forward (SnF) sessions acquired on that SNL. To get the information about the session, use SwCall() with the following primitive:  
  
 ![Getting session information](../../adapters-and-accelerators/fileact-interact/media/b7feb4b4-de92-4bb9-bcfe-363a127d0ed2.gif "b7feb4b4-de92-4bb9-bcfe-363a127d0ed2")  
  
 Notice that you are not required to provide an AuthorizationContext. The information seen by the local SNL is returned, as shown in the following figure.
