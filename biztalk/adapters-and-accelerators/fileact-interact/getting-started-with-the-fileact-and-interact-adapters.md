# Getting Started with the FileAct and InterAct Adapters
The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) supplies secure messaging services and interface software to wholesale financial entities.  
  
 SWIFTNet is a global financial messaging network for secure connectivity between institutions participating in the financial services industry.  
  
 The FileAct and InterAct adapters for SWIFTNet provide connectivity between BizTalk Server and the SWIFT Secure IP Network (SIPN) for the transfer of files.  
  
 The SIPN transfers messages and files over a secure private network which interconnects financial institutions, financial industry infrastructures, and customers.  
  
 The FileAct and InterAct adapters use the SWIFTNet Link (SNL) application programming interface (APIs) to connect to the SIPN.
