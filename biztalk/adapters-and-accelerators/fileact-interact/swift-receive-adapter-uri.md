# SWIFT Receive Adapter URI
The URI for the receive adapter is constructed based on the Tuxedo end point information (SWIFT://\<SwTuxSrv\>) for the SWIFTNet Link (SNL), and the message partner (SWIFT://\<SagMessagePartner\>) information for the SWIFTAlliance Gateway receive adapter (SAG-RA) deployment.  
  
 This is represented as the **Application name** property on the receive adapter property page.
