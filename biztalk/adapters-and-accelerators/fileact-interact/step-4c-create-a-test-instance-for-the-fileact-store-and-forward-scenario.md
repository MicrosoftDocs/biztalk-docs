# Step 4C: Create a Test Instance for the FileAct Store and Forward Scenario
Before you begin this step, you must complete [Step 4B: Start the Send Ports and Receive Ports for the FileAct Store and Forward Scenario](../../adapters-and-accelerators/fileact-interact/step-4b-start-the-send-ports-and-receive-ports-for-fileact-store-and-forward.md).  
  
### To create a test instance  
  
1.  Open a new file in a text editor, such as Notepad, and paste the following:  
  
    ```  
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>  
    <Sw-ExchangeFileRequest>  
    <Sw-FileRequest>  
    <Sw-FileOpRequest>  
    <Sw-PutFileRequest>  
    <Sw-PhysicalName>%PhysicalFolderName%\sample_put.txt</Sw-PhysicalName>  
    </Sw-PutFileRequest>  
    </Sw-FileOpRequest>  
    </Sw-FileRequest>  
    </Sw-ExchangeFileRequest>  
    ```  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  You must replace %PhysicalFolderName% with the actual folder name you configured in the FILEACT receive location.  
  
2.  Save the file with the name “PutReqSimple.xml”.  
  
3.  Make sure that the file (Sample_put.txt) is placed in the Client Location folder.
