# Configure a port using the WCF-custom adapter and Oracle E-Business Suite
How to configure WCF-Custom send and receive ports to perform outbound and inbound operations on Oracle E-Business Suite using the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)].  
  
## Prerequisites  
Sign in with an account that is a member of the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administrators or BizTalk Operators group. For more detailed information about permissions, see [Permissions Required for Deploying and Managing a BizTalk Application](../../core/permissions-required-for-deploying-and-managing-a-biztalk-application.md), and [Minimum Security Rights](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/24590.minimum-security-rights-for-biztalk-server-2006-to-2016.aspx).
  
## Deploy adapters to send messages to Oracle EBS  
 Perform the following steps to configure a WCF-Custom send port for sending messages to Oracle E-Business Suite using the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console.  
  
1. Open the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console.  
  
2. In the console tree, expand **BizTalk Group**, and then expand **Applications**.  
  
3. Expand the application under which you want to deploy the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)].  
  
4. Right-click **Send Ports**, point to **New**, and then point to the type of port you want to configure depending on the mode of communication between [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] and Oracle E-Business Suite.  
  
5. In the **Send Port Properties** dialog box, on the **General** tab, type a name for the send port.  
  
6. From the **Type** drop-down list, select **WCF-Custom**, and then click **Configure**.  
  
7. In the **WCF-Custom Transport Properties** dialog box, do the following:  
  
   1. Click the **General** tab, and in the **Address (URI)** field, specify the connection URI for Oracle E-Business Suite. For more information about the connection URI, see [Create the Oracle E-Business Suite Connection URI](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/create-the-oracle-e-business-suite-connection-uri.md).  
  
   2. On the **General** tab, in the **Action** text box, type the action for the operation. See [Messages and Message Schemas for Oracle EBS adapter](messages-and-message-schemas-for-biztalk-adapter-for-oracle-e-business-suite.md)) for a list of actions for each operation. For example, the action to invoke the Insert operation on an interface table (FA_BOOKS) under the Asset application is:  
  
      ```  
      InterfaceTables/Insert/OFA/FA/FA_BOOKS  
      ```  
  
   3. Click the **Binding** tab, and from the **Binding Type** list, select **oracleEBSBinding**. You can specify the different binding properties exposed by the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)]. For more information about binding properties, see [Read about the BizTalk Adapter for Oracle E-Business Suite Binding Properties](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/read-about-the-biztalk-adapter-for-oracle-e-business-suite-binding-properties.md).  
  
   4. Click the **Credentials** tab, and then do one of the following:  
  
      -   Select the **Do not use Single Sign-On** option, and specify the user name and password to connect to Oracle E-Business Suite.
