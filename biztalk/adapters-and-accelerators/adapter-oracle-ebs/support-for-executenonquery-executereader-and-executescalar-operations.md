# Support for ExecuteNonQuery, ExecuteReader, and ExecuteScalar Operations
The [!INCLUDE[adapteroracleebusinesslong](../../includes/adapteroracleebusinesslong-md.md)] exposes the following outbound operations at the root level:

-   **ExecuteNonQuery**: Use this operation to execute any arbitrary SQL statements or PL/SQL blocks in Oracle E-Business Suite if you want to return multiple result sets. The input parameters of this function include a string parameter (the entire PL/SQL block to be executed) and an array of strings (OutRefCursorNames). Each string value specified in OutRefCursorNames is assumed to be the parameter name of an output REF CURSOR with the PL/SQL block returning REF CURSORS with the same names. This function also takes an OUT parameter (OutRefCursors), which is an array of DataSets. For information about DataSet, consult the Oracle documentation at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=124538](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=124538). The return value of this operation is of integer data type, and indicates the number of affected rows.

-   **ExecuteReader**: Use this operation to execute any arbitrary SQL statements or PL/SQL blocks in Oracle E-Business Suite if you want the result set to be returned as DataSet. This operation takes a string parameter as input, and returns a DataSet.

-   **ExecuteScalar**: Use this operation to execute any arbitrary SQL statements or PL/SQL blocks in Oracle E-Business Suite if you want only one value to be returned. If the return value is a result set, only the value in the first column of the first row is returned in a XML string format.

> [!NOTE]
> - The ExecuteNonQuery, ExecuteReader, and ExecuteScalar operations are not supported for the User Defined Types (UDTs).
>   - You can also set the applications context for the ExecuteNonQuery, ExecuteReader, and ExecuteScalar operations in [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)]. It is mandatory to set the applications context for the ExecuteNonQuery, ExecuteReader, and ExecuteScalar operations if any of the operation is targeted on an artifact in Oracle E-Business Suite (interface table, interface view, concurrent programs or request sets). For information about applications context, and how to set it, see [Set Application Context](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/set-application-context.md).
