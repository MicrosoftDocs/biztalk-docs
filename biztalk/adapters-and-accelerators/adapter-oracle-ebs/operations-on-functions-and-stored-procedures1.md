# Operations on Functions and Stored Procedures
The [!INCLUDE[adapteroracleebusinesslong](../../includes/adapteroracleebusinesslong-md.md)] supports Oracle functions and procedures.

## Functions and procedures

The [!INCLUDE[adapteroracleebusinesslong](../../includes/adapteroracleebusinesslong-md.md)] supports Oracle functions and procedures in the following manner:  
  
- **Functions** are surfaced as operations. The name of the operation is the name of the Oracle function. IN, OUT, and IN OUT parameters are supported, as well as, RETURN values.  
  
  > [!IMPORTANT]
  >  If you pass an invalid parameter in a function (that is, pass a string value for a numeric field), the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] might throw an exception depending on the ODP.NET behavior. This is because the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] uses ODP.NET to communicate with Oracle E-Business Suite.  
  
- **Procedures** are surfaced as operations. The name of the operation is the name of the Oracle procedure. IN, OUT, and IN OUT parameters are supported.  
  
  > [!IMPORTANT]
  >  As part of a procedure, if you insert or update a decimal value (for example, 15.2) into a numeric field of an interface table or database table, the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] will throw an exception. This is because the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] uses ODP.NET to communicate with Oracle E-Business Suite, and ODP.NET does not support accepting decimal values for the numeric fields.  
  
- **REF CURSOR types** are supported for IN and OUT parameters for procedures and functions, as well as for function RETURN values. For more information, see [Operations on Functions and Procedures with REF CURSOR Parameters](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/operations-on-functions-and-procedures-with-ref-cursor-parameters1.md).  
  
- **RECORD types** are supported for IN, OUT, and IN OUT parameters for procedures and functions, as well as for function RETURN values. Both simple and complex (nested) RECORD types are supported. [Operations on Functions and Procedures with RECORD Types](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/operations-on-functions-and-procedures-with-record-types1.md)  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can also set the application context for functions and stored procedures in [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)]. For information about application context, and how to set it, see [Set Application Context](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/set-application-context.md).
