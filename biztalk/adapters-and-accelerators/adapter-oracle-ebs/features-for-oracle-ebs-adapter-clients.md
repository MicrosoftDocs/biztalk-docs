# Features for Oracle EBS adapter clients
In addition to the features discussed throughout the topics of [Overview of BizTalk Adapter for Oracle E-Business Suite](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/4f18fa2e-4e97-4c28-b38d-fc39ac53789e), the [!INCLUDE[adapteroracleebusinesslong](../../includes/adapteroracleebusinesslong-md.md)] also provides the following features that are useful for adapter clients:  
  
-   **Support for configuring adapters using binding properties**. Adapter clients can configure the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] by specifying certain binding properties. For example, clients can configure the adapter to use the ODP.NET connection pool by setting the **UseOracleConnectionPool** binding property. For more information, see [Read about the BizTalk Adapter for Oracle E-Business Suite Binding Properties](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/read-about-the-biztalk-adapter-for-oracle-e-business-suite-binding-properties.md).  
  
-   **Support for null values for operation parameters**. Adapter clients can provide null values for operation parameters using the “nil” attribute in the input XML.  
  
-   **Support for dynamic ports in BizTalk**. Through the BizTalk [!INCLUDE[wcfadapter_short](../../includes/wcfadapter-short-md.md)], the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] supports a dynamic port that enables dynamic routing of messages from [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] based on the message context properties. For more information, see [Configure Dynamic Ports in the SQL adapter](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sql/configure-dynamic-ports-in-the-sql-adapter.md).
