# Configure a port using the WCF-OracleEBS adapter
How to configure WCF-OracleEBS send and receive ports to perform outbound and inbound operations on Oracle E-Business Suite using the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)].  
  
## Prerequisites  
Sign in with an account that is a member of the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administrators or BizTalk Operators group. For more detailed information about permissions, see [Permissions Required for Deploying and Managing a BizTalk Application](../../core/permissions-required-for-deploying-and-managing-a-biztalk-application.md), and [Minimum Security Rights](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/24590.minimum-security-rights-for-biztalk-server-2006-to-2016.aspx).
  
## Deploy adapters to send messages to Oracle EBS 
 Perform the following steps to configure a WCF-OracleEBS send port for sending messages to Oracle E-Business Suite using the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console.    
 
1. Open the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console.  
  
2. Add the WCF-OracleEBS adapter to the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console. [Adding the Oracle E-Business Suite Adapter to BizTalk Server Administration Console](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/add-the-oracle-ebs-adapter-to-biztalk-server-administration-console.md) lists the steps.
  
3. In the console tree, expand **BizTalk Group**, and then expand **Applications**.  
  
4. Expand the application under which you want to deploy the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)].  
  
5. Right-click **Send Ports**, point to **New**, and then point to the type of port you want to configure depending on the mode of communication between [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] and Oracle E-Business Suite.  
  
6. In the **Send Port Properties** dialog box, on the **General** tab, type a name for the send port.  
  
7. From the **Type** drop-down list, select WCF-OracleEBS, and then click **Configure**.  
  
8. In the transport properties dialog box, do the following:  
  
   1. Click the **General** tab, click the **Configure** button and provide values for the connection parameters. For more information about the connection URI, see [Configure the Connection URI for Oracle E-Business Suite](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/configure-the-connection-uri-for-oracle-e-business-suite.md).  
  
   2. On the **General** tab, in the **Action** text box, type the action for the operation. See [Messages and Message Schemas for Oracle EBS adapter](messages-and-message-schemas-for-biztalk-adapter-for-oracle-e-business-suite.md) for a list of actions for each operation. For example, the action to invoke the Insert operation on an interface table (FA_BOOKS) under the Asset application is:  
  
      ```  
      InterfaceTables/Insert/OFA/FA/FA_BOOKS  
      ```  
  
   3. Click the **Binding** tab and specify values for the binding properties exposed by the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)]. For more information about binding properties, see [Read about the BizTalk Adapter for Oracle E-Business Suite Binding Properties](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/read-about-the-biztalk-adapter-for-oracle-e-business-suite-binding-properties.md).  
  
      > [!NOTE]
      >  The binding properties are displayed based on whether you are configuring a send port or a receive port. For example, binding properties related to notifications are not available while configuring a send port because notifications are inbound operations and require a receive port configuration.  
  
   4. Click the **Credentials** tab, and then do one of the following:  
  
      -   Select the **Do not use Single Sign-On** option, and specify the user name and password to connect to Oracle E-Business Suite.  
  
          |Use this|To do this|  
          |--------------|----------------|  
          |**To connect using Oracle database credentials**|Specify the **ClientCredentialType** binding property to **Database** and specify database credentials for **User name** and **Password** text boxes.|  
          |**To connect using Oracle E-Business Suite credentials**|Specify the **ClientCredentialType** binding property to **EBusiness** and specify Oracle E-Business Suite credentials for **User name** and **Password** text boxes.

          |**To connect using Windows Authentication if ClientCredentialType is set to “EBusiness”**|Specify Oracle E-Business Suite credentials for **User name** and **Password** text boxes. You must also specify a “/” for the **OracleUserName** binding property and leave the **OraclePassword** binding property blank.|  
  
      -   Select the **Use Single Sign-On** option, and specify an affiliate Enterprise Single Sign-on (SSO) application.  
  
   5. To return to the **Send Port Properties** dialog box, click **OK**.  
  
9. From the **Send handler** list, select **BizTalkServerApplication**.  
  
10. If you chose **Static One-Way Send Port** in step 5, specify a send pipeline. From the **Send pipeline** list, select the pipeline that corresponds to XMLTransmit.  
  
11. If you chose **Static Solicit-Response Port** in step 4, specify send and receive pipelines.  
  
    1.  From the **Send pipeline** drop-down list, select the pipeline that corresponds to XMLTransmit.  
  
    2.  From the **Receive pipeline** drop-down list, select the pipeline that corresponds to XMLReceive.  
  
12. Click **OK**.  
  
## Deploy adapters to receive messages from Oracle EBS
