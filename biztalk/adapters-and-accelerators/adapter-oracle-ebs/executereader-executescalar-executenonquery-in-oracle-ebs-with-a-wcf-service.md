# ExecuteReader, ExecuteScalar, or ExecuteNonQuery operations in Oracle E-Business Suite using the WCF service model
The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] exposes generic operations such as **ExecuteNonQuery**, **ExecuteReader**, and **ExecuteScalar**. You can use these operations to execute any statement on Oracle E-Business Suite. These operations differ based on the kind of response you get for the statement. For more information about how the adapter supports these operations, see [Support for ExecuteNonQuery, ExecuteReader, and ExecuteScalar Operations](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/support-for-executenonquery-executereader-and-executescalar-operations.md).  
  
 This topic demonstrates how to perform an **ExecuteReader** operation using the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] using the WCF service model. You can follow the same set of procedures described in this topic to perform **ExecuteNonQuery** and **ExecuteScalar** operations.  
  
## About the Examples Used in this Topic  
 The example in this topic performs an **ExecuteReader** operation to perform a SELECT operation on the MS_SAMPLE_EMPLOYEE interface table. The table is created by running the script provided with the samples. For more information about samples, see [Samples for the Oracle EBS adapter](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/samples-for-the-oracle-ebs-adapter.md). A sample, **ExecuteReader**, which is based on this topic, is also provided with the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] samples.  
  
## The WCF Client Class  
 The name of the WCF client generated for invoking generic operations (ExecuteNonQuery, ExecuteReader, or ExecuteScalar) using the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] is listed in the following table.  
  
|Operations|WCF Client Name|  
|----------------|---------------------|  
|ExecuteNonQuery, ExecuteReader, or ExecuteScalar|GenericOperation_Client|  
  
### Method Signature for Invoking Generic Operations  
 The following table shows the signature for the method exposed to invoke the generic operations.  
  
|Operation|Method Signature|  
|---------------|----------------------|  
|ExecuteNonQuery|int ExecuteNonQuery(string Query, string[] OutputRefCursorNames, out System.Data.DataSet[] OutputRefCursors)|  
|ExecuteReader|System.Data.DataSet ExecuteReader(string Query)|  
|ExecuteScalar|string ExecuteScalar(string Query)|  
  
 As an example, the signature for the generic operation methods is shown in the following code snippet.  
  
```  
public partial class GenericOperation_Client : System.ServiceModel.ClientBase<GenericOperation_>, GenericOperation_ {  
  public int ExecuteNonQuery(string Query, string[] OutputRefCursorNames, out System.Data.DataSet[] OutputRefCursors);  
  public System.Data.DataSet ExecuteReader(string Query);  
  public string ExecuteScalar(string Query);  
}  
```  
  
 In this snippet,  
  
-   `GenericOperation_Client` is the name of the class. This class is used to create a client to invoke the generic operation, ExecuteReader.  
  
-   `public System.Data.DataSet ExecuteReader(string Query)` is the method that you invoke to perform a SELECT statement on the MS_SAMPLE_EMPLOYEE interface table.  
  
## Creating a WCF Client to Invoke an ExecuteReader Operation  
 The generic set of actions required to perform an operation on Oracle E-Business Suite using a WCF client involves a set of tasks described in [Overview of the WCF service model with the Oracle E-Business Suite adapter](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/overview-of-the-wcf-service-model-with-the-oracle-e-business-suite-adapter.md). This section describes how to create a WCF client to invoke the **ExecuteReader** operation.  
  
#### To create a WCF client to invoke ExecuteReader operation  
  
1. Create a Visual C# project in Visual Studio. For this topic, create a console application.  
  
2. Generate the WCF client class for the **ExecuteReader** generic operation. This operation is available under the root node when you connect to the Oracle E-Business Suite using the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)]. For more information about generating a WCF client class, see [Generate a WCF client or a WCF service contract for Oracle E-Business Suite solution artifacts](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/create-a-wcf-client-or-wcf-service-contract-for-oracle-ebs-solution-artifacts.md).  
  
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   >  Before generating the WCF client class, make sure you set the **EnableBizTalkCompatibilityMode** binding property to false.  
  
3. In the Solution Explorer, add reference to `Microsoft.Adapters.OracleEBS` and `Microsoft.ServiceModel.Channels`.  
  
4. Open the Program.cs file and add the following namespaces:  
  
   -   `Microsoft.Adapters.OracleEBS`  
  
   -   `System.ServiceModel`  
  
5. In the Program.cs file, create a client as described in the snippet below.  
  
   ```  
   OracleEBSBinding binding = new OracleEBSBinding();  
   EndpointAddress address = new EndpointAddress("oracleebs://ebs-72-11");  
   GenericOperation_Client client = new GenericOperation_Client(binding, address);  
   ```  
  
    In this snippet, `GenericOperation_Client` is the WCF client defined in OracleEBSBindingClient.cs. This file is generated by the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)].  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   >  In this snippet, you explicitly specify the binding and endpoint address in your application code. You can use these values from the application configuration file, app.config, also generated by the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)]. For more information about the different ways of specifying client binding, see [Configure a client binding for the Oracle E-Business Suite](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/configure-a-client-binding-for-the-oracle-e-business-suite.md).  
  
6. Set the credentials for the client.  
  
   ```  
   client.ClientCredentials.UserName.UserName = "myuser";  
   client.ClientCredentials.UserName.Password = "mypassword";  
   ```  
  
7. Because you are performing an operation on an interface table, you must set the application context. In this example, to set the application context, you specify the **OracleUserName**, **OraclePassword**, and **OracleEBSResponsibilityName** binding properties. For more information about application context, see [Set application context](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/set-application-context.md).  
  
   ```  
   binding.OracleUserName = "myOracleEBSUserName";  
   binding.OraclePassword = "myOracleEBSPassword";  
   binding.OracleEBSResponsibilityName = "myOracleEBSResponsibility";  
   ```  
  
8. Open the client as described in the snippet below:  
  
   ```  
   try  
   {  
      Console.WriteLine("Opening Client...");  
      client.Open();  
   }  
   catch (Exception ex)  
   {  
      Console.WriteLine("Exception: " + ex.Message);  
      throw;  
   }  
   ```  
  
9. Invoke the **ExecuteReader** operation for performing the SELECT operation on MS_SAMPLE_EMPLOYEE table. Before you invoke the ExecuteReader operation, you must add the `System.Data` namespace to your code.  
  
    ```  
    string query = "SELECT * FROM MS_SAMPLE_EMPLOYEE";  
    DataSet ds = client.ExecuteReader(query);  
  
    Console.WriteLine("Invoking the SELECT statement using ExecuteReader");  
    Console.WriteLine("*****************************************************");  
    foreach (DataTable tab in ds.Tables)  
    {  
       foreach (DataRow row in tab.Rows)  
       {  
          Console.WriteLine("The details of the employee are: ");  
          for (int i = 0; i < tab.Columns.Count; i++)  
          {  
             Console.WriteLine(row[i]);  
          }  
          Console.WriteLine();  
       }  
    }  
    Console.WriteLine("*****************************************************");  
    Console.ReadLine();  
  
    ```  
  
10. Close the client as described in the snippet below:  
  
    ```  
    client.Close();  
    Console.WriteLine("Press any key to exit...");  
    Console.ReadLine();  
    ```  
  
11. Build the project and then run it. All the records in the MS_SAMPLE_EMPLOYEE table are displayed on the console.
