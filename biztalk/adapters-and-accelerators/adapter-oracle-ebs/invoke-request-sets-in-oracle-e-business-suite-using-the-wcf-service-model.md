# Invoke request sets in Oracle E-Business Suite using the WCF service model
[!INCLUDE[adapteroracleebusinesslong](../../includes/adapteroracleebusinesslong-md.md)] enables you to execute request sets in Oracle E-Business Suite. Request sets are divided into one or more stages, and each stage contains a set of reports and concurrent programs. For more information about how the adapter supports request sets, see [Operations on Request Sets](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/operations-on-request-sets.md).  
  
## The WCF Client Class  
 The name of the WCF client generated for invoking the request sets by the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] is listed in the following table.  
  
|Artifact|WCF Client Name|  
|--------------|---------------------|  
|Request Set|RequestSets_[APP_NAME]Client|  
  
 [APP_NAME] = Actual name of the Oracle E-Business Suite application; for example, SQLAP.  
  
### Method Signature for Invoking Request Sets  
 The following table shows the method signature for request sets.  
  
|Operation|Method Signature|  
|---------------|----------------------|  
|Request Set|public \<return type\> \<request set name\>(param 1, param 2, â€¦)|  
  
 As an example, the following code shows the method signatures for a WCF client class generated for the **reqset_singlestage** request set.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This is a custom request set and might not be available on your Oracle E-Business Solution instance.  
  
```  
public partial class RequestSets_SQLAPClient : System.ServiceModel.ClientBase<RequestSets_SQLAP>, RequestSets_SQLAP{      
  
    public string REQSTG(  
      schemas.microsoft.com.OracleEBS._2008._05.Options.SetRelClassOptions SetRelClassOptions,  
      schemas.microsoft.com.OracleEBS._2008._05.Options.SetPrintOptions SetPrintOptions,   
      schemas.microsoft.com.OracleEBS._2008._05.Options.SetRepeatOptions SetRepeatOptions,   
      schemas.microsoft.com.OracleEBS._2008._05.Options.SetNlsOptions SetNlsOptions,  
      string StartTime,  
      schemas.microsoft.com.OracleEBS._2008._05.RequestSetStage.SQLAP.REQSTG.set1 set1_set1);  
}  
```  
  
 In this snippet, **RequestSets_SQLAPClient** is the name of the WCF class in the OracleEBSBindingClient.cs generated by the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)]. **REQSTG** is the name of the method to invoke the request set.  
  
## Creating a WCF Client to Invoke Request Sets  
 The generic set of actions required to perform an operation on Oracle E-Business Suite using a WCF client involves a set of tasks described in [Overview of the WCF service model with the Oracle E-Business Suite adapter](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/overview-of-the-wcf-service-model-with-the-oracle-e-business-suite-adapter.md). This section describes how to create a WCF client to invoke the **reqset_singlestage** request set.  
  
#### To create a WCF client  
  
1.  Create a Visual C# project in Visual Studio. For this topic, create a console application.  
  
2.  Generate the WCF client class for the **reqset_singlestage** request set. For more information about generating a WCF client class, see [Generate a WCF client or a WCF service contract for Oracle E-Business Suite solution artifacts](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/create-a-wcf-client-or-wcf-service-contract-for-oracle-ebs-solution-artifacts.md).  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >  Before generating the WCF client class, make sure you set the **EnableBizTalkCompatibilityMode** binding property to false.  
  
3.  In the Solution Explorer, add reference to `Microsoft.Adapters.OracleEBS` and `Microsoft.ServiceModel.Channels`.  
  
4.  Open the Program.cs file and add the following namespaces:  
  
    -   `Microsoft.Adapters.OracleEBS`  
  
    -   `System.ServiceModel`  
  
5.  Open the Program.cs file and create a client as described in the snippet below.  
  
    ```  
    OracleEBSBinding binding = new OracleEBSBinding();  
    EndpointAddress address = new EndpointAddress("oracleebs://ebs_instance_name");  
    RequestSets_SQLAPClient client = new RequestSets_SQLAPClient(binding, address);  
    ```  
  
     In this snippet, `RequestSets_SQLAPClient` is the WCF client defined in OracleEBSBindingClient.cs. This file is generated by the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)].  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  In this snippet, you explicitly specify the binding and endpoint address in your application code. You can also use these values from the application configuration file, app.config, also generated by the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)]. For more information about the different ways of specifying client binding, see [Configure a client binding for the Oracle E-Business Suite](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/configure-a-client-binding-for-the-oracle-e-business-suite.md).  
  
6.  Set the credentials for the client.  
  
    ```  
    client.ClientCredentials.UserName.UserName = "myuser";  
    client.ClientCredentials.UserName.Password = "mypassword";  
    ```  
  
7.  Because you are invoking request sets in an Oracle E-Business Suite application, you must set the application context. In this example, to set the application context, you specify the **OracleUserName**, **OraclePassword**, and **OracleEBSResponsibilityName** binding properties. For more information about application context, see [Set application context](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/set-application-context.md).  
  
    ```  
    binding.OracleUserName = "myOracleEBSUserName";  
    binding.OraclePassword = "myOracleEBSPassword";  
    binding.OracleEBSResponsibilityName = "myOracleEBSResponsibility";  
    ```  
  
8.  Open the client as described in the snippet below:  
  
    ```  
    try  
    {  
       Console.WriteLine("Opening Client...");  
       client.Open();  
    }  
    catch (Exception ex)  
    {  
       Console.WriteLine("Exception: " + ex.Message);  
       throw;  
    }  
    ```  
  
9. Invoke the **reqset_singlestage** request set.  
  
    ```  
    string RequestID;  
  
    schemas.microsoft.com.OracleEBS._2008._05.RequestSetStage.SQLAP.REQSTG.set1 param =  
        new schemas.microsoft.com.OracleEBS._2008._05.RequestSetStage.SQLAP.REQSTG.set1();  
  
    param.INSPARAMPROG = new schemas.microsoft.com.OracleEBS._2008._05.RequestSetConcurrentProgram.SQLAP.REQSTG.set1.SQLAP1.INSPARAMPROG();  
    param.INSPARAMPROG.p_id = "123";  
    param.INSPARAMPROG.p_name = "MyName";  
  
    try  
    {  
        Console.WriteLine("Invoking the reqset_singlestage request set");  
        RequestID = client.REQSTG(null, null, null, null, null, param);  
        Console.WriteLine("The request ID generated for the request set is : " + RequestID);  
        Console.WriteLine("*****************************************************************");  
        Console.WriteLine("\nHit <RETURN> to end");  
        Console.ReadLine();  
    }  
    catch (Exception ex)  
    {  
        Console.WriteLine("Exception : " + ex);  
        throw;  
    }  
    ```  
  
10. Close the client as described in the snippet below:  
  
    ```  
    client.Close();  
    ```  
  
11. Build the project and then run it. The application invokes the **reqset_singlestage** request set and returns a request ID, which is written to the console.
