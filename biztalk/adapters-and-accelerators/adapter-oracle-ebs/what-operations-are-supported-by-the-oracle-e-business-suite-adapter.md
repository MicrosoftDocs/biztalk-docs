# What operations are supported by the Oracle E-Business Suite adapter
## Overview
Adapter clients can perform operations in Oracle E-Business Suite by:  
  
- Creating BizTalk projects  
  
- Using the WCF channel model  
  
- Using the WCF service model  
  
  The [!INCLUDE[adapteroracleebusinesslong](../../includes/adapteroracleebusinesslong-md.md)] exposes operations that applications can invoke on it and that it can, in turn, invoke on applications. These operations are invoked by sending SOAP messages over a channel. If a response is required, it is returned in a SOAP message over the same channel. For information about the message structure and the SOAP action associated with each operation, see [messages and message schemas for BizTalk Adapter for Oracle E-Business Suite](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/messages-and-message-schemas-for-biztalk-adapter-for-oracle-e-business-suite.md).  
  
  This section provides information about the operations supported in Oracle E-Business Suite using the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)].
