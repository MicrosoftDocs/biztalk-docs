# Enable MS distributed transaction coordinator to allow transactions for Oracle E-Business Suite
Configure MSDTC before you start creating applications that use the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)].  
  
The operations performed on Oracle E-Business Suite using the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] (through [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], the WCF service model, or the WCF channel model) can be performed within a transaction scope. If the client program has more than one transactional resource as part of the same transaction, the transaction gets elevated to an MSDTC transaction. To enable the adapter to perform operations within the scope of an MSDTC transaction, configure MSDTC on the computer running the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)], and on the Oracle E-Business Suite. Also, add MSDTC to the exceptions list in your firewall, which may be the built-in Windows Firewall. 
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The steps to configure MSDTC vary for different operating systems. The steps listed in this topic apply to Windows client and Windows Server operating systems.  
  
## Configure MSDTC  
  
1. Open **Component Services**.  

   Or, In **Server Manager**, select **Tools**, and then select **Component Services**.  
  
2. Expand **Component Services**, expand **Computers**, expand **My Computer**, expand **Distributed Transaction Coordinator**, right-click **Local DTC**, and select **Properties**.  
  
3. Select the **Security** tab. In this tab, select all of the following: 

   - **Network DTC Access**
   - **Allow Remote Clients** 
   - **Allow Inbound** 
   - **Allow Outbound** 
   - **No Authentication Required**
  
4. Select **OK** to save your changes.  
  
5. If prompted to restarted the MSDTC service, select **Yes**. After the MSDTC service is restarted, close the properties and the Component Services MMC. 
  
## Add MSDTC to Windows Firewall exceptions list  

> [!TIP] 
>  Microsoft Distributed Tansaction Coordinator (MSDTC) may already be allowed in your firewall. If so, it is listed as an Inbound Rule. If it's not listed, use this section to allow MSDTC. 

1.  Open **Windows Firewall**, and select **Advanced Settings** on the left.  

    Or, In **Server Manager**, select **Tools**, and then select **Windows Firewall with Advanced Security**.  
  
2.  Right click **Inbound Rules**, and select **New Rule**.  
  
3.  In the wizard: 

    1. Select **Program**, and select **Next**. 
    2. Set the **program path** to `%SystemRoot%\system32\msdtc.exe`, and select **Next**.  
    3. **Allow the connection**, and select **Next**.
    4. Select **Domain**, and select **Next**.
    5. Enter any name, such as `MSDTC for Oracle EBS`, and select **Finish**.
  
5.  Complete the wizard, and close Windows Firewall.
