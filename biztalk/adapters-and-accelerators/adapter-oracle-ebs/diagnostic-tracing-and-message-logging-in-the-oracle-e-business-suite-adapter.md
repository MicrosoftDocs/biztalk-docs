# Diagnostic Tracing and Message Logging in the Oracle E-Business Suite adapter
Diagnostic tracing helps to effectively diagnose problems that you might encounter when using the adapters. This topic provides information about the following three types of tracing supported with [!INCLUDE[adapteroracleebusinesslong](../../includes/adapteroracleebusinesslong-md.md)]:  
  
-   Oracle server-side tracing using a client identifier
  
-   WCF tracing between the adapter client and the adapter
  
-   WCF tracing within the adapter
 
## Oracle server side tracing using a client identifier  
 Oracle allows you to perform server-side tracing for the operations performed by client applications on the Oracle database. Because requests from client applications can be routed to different database sessions, it becomes difficult to trace the origin of the request. However, Oracle facilitates end-to-end application tracing using client identifiers. 
 
 The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] exposes the `OracleConnectionClientId` binding property that allows you to specify the client identifier at the design time for the connection used by the adapter to connect to Oracle. The adapter client identifier helps you in selective tracing of the operations performed by the adapter client on Oracle, and also allows you to filter and view the Oracle server traces based on the client identifier. For information about how you can enable tracing for client identifiers in Oracle, see [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=135746](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=135746).  
  
## WCF tracing between the adapter client and the adapter  
 Adapter clients can enable WCF tracing to trace issues between the adapter client and the adapter. WCF tracing is used to trace the input XML that comes from the adapter client by using the WCF service model and is useful in diagnosing serialization issues. WCF tracing is not used for the WCF channel model or for output messages from the adapter to the adapter client. You can activate WCF tracing for BizTalk applications and WCF service model applications by adding an excerpt to the respective configuration files. Also, you can enable tracing both at design-time and run-time.  
  
-   **Tracing at design-time**. For the design-time experience, you may use the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservshort](../../includes/consumeadapterservshort-md.md)], or the [!INCLUDE[addadapterwiz](../../includes/addadapterwiz-md.md)]. All these tools can be used from [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)]. So, to enable tracing for the design-time experience, you must add the excerpt to the devenv.exe.config file located in *\<installation drive\>*:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio *\<version\>*\Common7\IDE.  
  
-   **Tracing at run-time**. For run-time tracing, you must add the excerpt depending on the application you are using.  
  
    -   For a [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] applications, you must add the excerpt to the BizTalk configuration file, typically BTSNTSvc.exe.config. For [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)], this file is available typically under \<installation drive\>:\Program Files\Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)].  
  
    -   For a WCF service model .NET application, you must add the excerpt to the app.config file of your project.  
  
 To enable WCF tracing, add the following excerpt within the `<configuration>` tag:  
  
```  
<system.diagnostics>  
    <sources>  
      <source name ="System.ServiceModel" switchValue="Verbose">  
        <listeners>  
          <add name="xml" />  
        </listeners>  
      </source>  
      <source name ="System.ServiceModel.MessageLogging"   
              switchValue="Verbose, ActivityTracing">          
        <listeners>  
          <add name="xml" />  
        </listeners>  
      </source>  
      <source name ="System.Runtime.Serialization" switchValue="Verbose">  
        <listeners>  
          <add name="xml" />  
        </listeners>  
      </source>  
   </sources>  
   <sharedListeners>  
      <add name="xml" type="System.Diagnostics.XmlWriterTraceListener"                
           traceOutputOptions="LogicalOperationStack"   
           initializeData="C:\log\WCFTrace.svclog" />  
   </sharedListeners>  
   <trace autoflush="true" />  
  </system.diagnostics>  
  <system.serviceModel>  
    <diagnostics>  
      <messageLogging   
           logEntireMessage="true"   
           logMalformedMessages="false"  
           logMessagesAtServiceLevel="true"   
           logMessagesAtTransportLevel="false"/>  
    </diagnostics>      
  </system.serviceModel>  
```  
  
 This saves the WCF traces to C:\log\WCFTrace.svclog. [WCF tracing](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms730342.aspx) provides more information.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Make sure you mitigate potential security threats of exposing sensitive business data that can be caused when enabling tracing. For recommendations, see the [Best Practices for Message and Instance Data Tracking](../../core/best-practices-for-message-and-instance-data-tracking.md).  
  
## WCF tracing within the adapter  
 The adapters log different categories of useful information to the trace file such as errors, warnings, and information messages. Such information is useful in understanding the process flow within the adapter and diagnosing issues with the adapter. You can activate the [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)] and adapter tracing for BizTalk applications and WCF service model applications by adding an excerpt to the respective configuration files. Also, you can enable tracing both at design-time and run-time.  
  
-   **Tracing at design-time**. For the design-time experience, you may use the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservshort](../../includes/consumeadapterservshort-md.md)], or the [!INCLUDE[addadapterwiz](../../includes/addadapterwiz-md.md)]. All these tools can be used from [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)]. So, to enable tracing for the design-time experience, you must add the excerpt to the devenv.exe.config file located in *\<installation drive\>*:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio *\<version\>*\Common7\IDE.  
  
-   **Tracing at run-time**. For run-time tracing, you must add the excerpt depending on the application you are using.  
  
    -   For a [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] applications, you must add the excerpt to the BizTalk configuration file, typically BTSNTSvc.exe.config. For [!INCLUDE[btsbiztalkserver2006r2](../../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r2-md.md)], this file is available typically under \<installation drive\>:\Program Files\Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006](../../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006-md.md)]. For [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)], this file is available typically under \<installation drive\>:\Program Files\Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)].  
  
    -   For a WCF service model .NET application, you must add the excerpt to the app.config file of your project.  
  
 To enable [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)] and adapter tracing, add the following excerpt within the `<configuration>` tag:  
  
```  
<system.diagnostics>  
    <sources>  
      <source name="Microsoft.ServiceModel.Channels" switchValue="Error">  
        <listeners>  
          <add name="xml" />  
        </listeners>  
      </source>  
      <source name="Microsoft.Adapters.OracleEBS" switchValue="Information">  
        <listeners>  
          <add name="xml" />  
        </listeners>  
      </source>  
    </sources>  
    <sharedListeners>  
      <add name="xml" type="System.Diagnostics.XmlWriterTraceListener"   
   traceOutputOptions="LogicalOperationStack"   
          initializeData="C:\log\AdapterTrace.svclog" />  
    </sharedListeners>  
    <trace autoflush="true" />  
  </system.diagnostics>  
```  
  
 This saves the WCF traces to C:\log\AdapterTrace.svclog.  
  
## Viewing the traces  
 You can use the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) Service Trace Viewer tool to view the traces. [Using Service Trace Viewer for Viewing Correlated Traces and Troubleshooting](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa751795.aspx) provides more details on this tool.  
  
## Configuring tracking for BizTalk applications  
 The BizTalk Server Administration console lets you configure various tracking options for items such as send ports and receive ports. The tracking configuration settings enable you to track inbound and outbound event data, message properties, message bodies, and orchestrations. For more information about configuring tracking for BizTalk applications, see [Managing and tracking your artifacts](../../core/managing-artifacts.md).  
  
 You can also use Group Hub to [view tracked message and instance data](../../core/viewing-tracked-message-and-instance-data.md), including best practices, saving tracking queries, and more.
