# Develop your Oracle E-Business Suite applications

## Overview
The [!INCLUDE[adapteroracleebusinesslong](../../includes/adapteroracleebusinesslong-md.md)] is a [!INCLUDE[firstref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/firstref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] binding. Client applications can consume the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] to invoke operations on Oracle E-Business Suite artifacts. The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] can be consumed:  
  
- Through a physical port binding in a [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] solution.  
  
- By invoking methods on an instance of a client proxy.  
  
- By sending SOAP messages over a channel instance in code that uses the WCF channel model.  

## BizTalk vs WCF service vs WCF channel 
  
 The following table:  
  
- Lists the different operations that can be performed on Oracle E-Business Suite using the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)].  
  
- Provides links to the topics containing information about performing the task using the chosen approach ([!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], WCF service model or WCF channel model).

## Next steps  
 The topics in this section provide information, procedures, and examples to help you develop applications that consume the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] in both [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] and .NET programming solutions.
