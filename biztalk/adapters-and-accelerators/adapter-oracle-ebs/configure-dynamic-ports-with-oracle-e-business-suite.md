# Configure dynamic ports with Oracle E-Business Suite
In [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], you can configure dynamic ports for a [!INCLUDE[wcfadapter_short](../../includes/wcfadapter-short-md.md)]. Because the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] is a WCF-based adapter, you can dynamically configure a port for the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] by using message context properties.  
  
 For the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)], the URI, action, and binding may be determined from a property on an incoming message, and then specified in the **Expression** shape, as shown in the following example:  
  
```  
Request2=Request1;  
Request2(WCF.Action)="InterfaceTables/Insert/OFA/FA/FA_BOOKS";  
Request2(WCF.BindingType)="oracleEBSBinding";  
Request2(WCF.UserName)="myuser";  
Request2(WCF.Password)="mypass";  
SendPort(Microsoft.XLANGs.BaseTypes.Address)="oracleebs://ebs_instance";  
SendPort(Microsoft.XLANGs.BaseTypes.TransportType)="WCF-Custom";  
```  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If you are using a WCF-OracleEBS adapter in [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console, you can also specify the transport type as `SendPort(Microsoft.XLANGs.BaseTypes.TransportType)="OracleEBSAdapter"`, where **OracleEBSAdapter** is the name with which you added the WCF-OracleEBS adapter in [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console.  
  
 In the preceding example,  
  
- Request2 message is being created from Request1 message. Both messages map to an operation schema, which is generated using the [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservshort](../../includes/consumeadapterservshort-md.md)].  
  
- SendPort is the name of the logical send port in the BizTalk orchestration.  
  
  The **Expression** shape is part of the BizTalk orchestration. Deploying the orchestration also creates a WCF-Custom send port.
