In turn, the [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)] is built on top of WCF. The adapters are exposed as WCF channels to adapter clients. This enables connectivity, metadata exchange, and business data exchange with external systems.                                                                                                    |
|                                                 Support for the WCF channel model and the WCF service models                                                 |                                                                                                                                                In the WCF *channel* model, adapter clients can consume the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] by directly sending and receiving XML messages.<br /><br /> In the WCF *service* model, adapter clients can generate a .NET proxy class from the Web Services Description Language (WSDL) obtained using [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)].                                                                                                                                                |

|                                                      Two ways of connecting to Oracle E-Business Suite                                                       | The adapter clients can connect to Oracle E-Business Suite by either using the net service name in the tnsnames.ora file or by directly specifying the connection parameters, and thus eliminating the need to use a net service name or the tnsnames.ora file. Not requiring the tnsnames.ora file to connect to Oracle E-Business Suite saves you from the hassle of manually updating the connection parameters (net service name) in the tnsnames.ora file on every client computer when you add or update Oracle servers in your environment.

|                                                              Support for Windows Authentication                                                              |                                                       The adapter clients can use Windows Authentication to connect to Oracle E-Business Suite. Windows Authentication enables you to determine the userâ€™s identity based on the Windows logon credentials, and thus helps you to leverage the built-in security of the Windows environment. For more information about Windows Authentication in the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)], see [Connect to Oracle E-Business Suite Using Windows Authentication](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/connect-to-oracle-e-business-suite-using-windows-authentication.md).                                                        |
| Support for using the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] with Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              You can use the adapters to present data from the Oracle E-Business Suite onto a MOSS portal. For more information, see [Using the Oracle E-Business Adapter with Microsoft Office SharePoint Server](./use-the-oracle-e-business-suite-adapter-with-sharepoint.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

A request set is a set of concurrent programs, and can be used to run several concurrent programs with predefined parameters. Request sets are executed in stages. For more information about request sets, see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=129539](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=129539).                                                                                          |
|           Support for specifying inline values in the Insert operation            | You can use the **InlineValue** attribute in the Insert operation to insert computed values into interface tables and database tables in Oracle. This is an optional attribute and is available for all simple data records in an Insert operation. If you specify a value for this attribute, it overrides the specified value of a record.

|                       Support for PL/SQL RECORD data types                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Adapter clients can operate with RECORD and nested RECORD types in stored procedures and functions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|           Support for overloaded functions and procedures in PL/SQL API           |                                                                                   Adapter clients can invoke overloaded functions and procedures in PL/SQL APIs. However, the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] does not support the use of overloaded procedures using strongly-typed and weakly-typed REF CURSORS. Internally, the adapter treats both the strongly-typed and weakly-typed REF CURSORS as just REF CURSORS.                                                                                    |
|                     Support for database change notifications                     |      Adapter clients can receive database change notifications from Oracle database based on a triggering SELECT statement. The notification is sent by Oracle database to the adapter clients as and when the result set for the SELECT statement changes. For more information about database change notifications, see [Consideration for Receiving Database Change Notifications using the ORacle Database adapter](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-database/before-you-receive-database-change-notifications-using-the-oracle-db-adapter.md).      |
|                               Support for synonyms                                |                                                                     Adapter clients can perform operations on synonyms created for tables, views, stored procedures, functions and packages. For more information about synonyms, and how you can use the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] to perform operations on synonyms, see [Operations on Synonyms](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/operations-on-synonyms2.md).                                                                      |

| Multi-Language Support (MLS) | Adapter clients can use the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] to perform operations in Oracle E-Business Suite and the underlying database having multiple language packs installed. This implies that the adapter clients can perform operations on the data in multiple languages. For example, you can view localized (non-English) data in an interface view, or insert localized data in a table. The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] supports as many languages as those supported by the underlying Oracle E-Business Suite installation.<br /><br /> The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] exposes the **MlsSettings** binding property to configure the multiple language support feature. For more information about the binding property, see [Read about the BizTalk Adapter for Oracle E-Business Suite Binding Properties](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/read-about-the-biztalk-adapter-for-oracle-e-business-suite-binding-properties.md). |
