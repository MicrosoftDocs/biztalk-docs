# Develop BizTalk applications using the Oracle E-Business Suite adapter
Developing BizTalk applications involves creating a BizTalk project in [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)], and using the **[!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservlong](../../includes/consumeadapterservlong-md.md)]** or **[!INCLUDE[addadapterwiz](../../includes/addadapterwiz-md.md)]** to generate XML schema. Once you have generated the schema, you can either use Content-Based Routing (CBR) or create BizTalk orchestrations to send and receive messages that conform to your generated schema.  
  
 CBR can be used in scenarios where the messages being sent to Oracle E-Business Suite do not require any intensive processing. For example, if you know that the receive port receive messages only of a certain type, you can add a filter to the send port to route messages that match the filter expression to the send port.  

## Use orchestration  
 In BizTalk orchestrations, you create send and receive ports to send and receive messages to and from the [!INCLUDE[wcfadapter_short](../../includes/wcfadapter-short-md.md)], which in turn sends the messages to [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)]. 
 
 This section provides information about using BizTalk orchestrations to perform tasks and operations on Oracle E-Business Suite using the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort_md](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)]. The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] in turn uses the [!INCLUDE[wcfadapter_short](../../includes/wcfadapter-short-md.md)], which can interact with a WCF binding.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  To use the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] with Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], you must always set the **EnableBizTalkCompatibilityMode** binding property to **True**. For the steps, see [Configure the binding properties for Oracle E-Business Suite](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/configure-the-binding-properties-for-oracle-e-business-suite.md).
