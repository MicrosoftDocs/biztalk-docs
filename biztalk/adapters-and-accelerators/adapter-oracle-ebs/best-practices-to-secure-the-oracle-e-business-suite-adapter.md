# Best practices to secure the Oracle E-Business Suite adapter
This section provides best practices that you should follow to more completely protect sensitive data when you use or develop applications that consume the [!INCLUDE[adapteroracleebusinesslong](../../includes/adapteroracleebusinesslong-md.md)].

## Security Best Practices for the Connection between the Oracle E-Business Adapter and the Oracle Database

- The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] provides no support for helping to secure communication between it and the Oracle E-Business Suite. You must provide a mechanism to help ensure an adequate level of security for data exchanged between the adapter and the Oracle database.

- Do not provide user name password credentials for the Oracle database in the connection URI. See the following sections for alternative methods of providing credentials to the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)].

- The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] also enables you to use Windows Authentication while connecting to Oracle E-Business Suite to generate metadata and perform operations, either through [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)]. Before using Windows Authentication, you must perform the steps listed in [Connect to Oracle E-Business Suite using Windows Authentication](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/connect-to-oracle-e-business-suite-using-windows-authentication.md).

  For more information, see [Security between Oracle E-Business Suite and the adapter](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/security-between-oracle-e-business-suite-and-the-adapter.md).

## Security Best Practices for Consuming the Oracle E-Business Adapter with BizTalk Server

- You should avoid providing user name password credentials for Oracle E-Business Suite in the connection URI.

- When you use the [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservshort](../../includes/consumeadapterservshort-md.md)], enter the user name password credential for Oracle E-Business Suite from the **Security** tab of the **Configure Adapter** dialog box.

- When you configure the BizTalk WCF-Custom adapter for the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] on a send port, enter the user name password credential for the Oracle database from the **Credentials** tab of the **Configure WCF Custom Transport** dialog box.

- When you configure the BizTalk WCF-Custom adapter for the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] on a receive location, enter the user name password credential for the Oracle database from the **Other** tab of the **Configure WCF Custom Transport** dialog box.

- After exporting a binding file from an application in [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], you must manually remove the value of the **OraclePassword** binding property (available in clear text) from the binding file, and then specify it again on each host where the exported binding will be used.

- The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] also enables you to use Windows Authentication while connecting to Oracle E-Business Suite to generate metadata and perform operations, either through [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)]. Before using Windows Authentication, you must perform the steps listed in [Connect to Oracle E-Business Suite using Windows Authentication](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/connect-to-oracle-e-business-suite-using-windows-authentication.md).

- If an application that consumes the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] sends messages that contain sensitive database information across a process boundary to another service or client, ensure that these messages have sufficient security measures applied to provide adequate data protection in your environment.

  For more information, see [Security with the Oracle E-Business Suite adapter and BizTalk Server](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/security-with-the-oracle-e-business-suite-adapter-and-biztalk-server.md).

## Security Best Practices for Consuming the Oracle E-Business Adapter with Programming Solutions

- You should avoid providing user name password credentials for the Oracle database in the connection URI.

- When you use the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservreflong](../../includes/addadapterservreflong-md.md)], enter the user name password credential for the Oracle database from the **Security** tab of the **Configure Adapter** dialog box.

- In WCF channel model programming, use the **Credentials** property on the channel factory to set the user name password credential for the Oracle database.

- In WCF service model programming, use the **ClientCredentials** property on the WCF client to set the user name password credential for the Oracle database.

- If an application that consumes the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] sends messages that contain sensitive database information across a process boundary to another service or client, ensure that these messages have sufficient security measures applied to provide adequate data protection in your environment.

- The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] also enables you to use Windows Authentication while connecting to Oracle E-Business Suite to generate metadata and perform operations, either through [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)]. Before using Windows Authentication, you must perform the steps listed in [Connect to Oracle E-Business Suite using Windows Authentication](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/connect-to-oracle-e-business-suite-using-windows-authentication.md).

  For more information see, [Security Considerations for Adapters](../../core/security-considerations-for-adapters.md).

## Security Best Practices for Hosting the Oracle E-Business Adapter in IIS
 Hosting the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) as a Web service exposes operations surfaced by the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] to Web clients. These operations might involve exchanging sensitive data over the Internet, so you should take measures to help ensure that this data is as secure as possible.

 [!INCLUDE[nextref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/nextref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] provides two standard bindings for HTTP transport: the **BasicHttpBinding** provides basic HTTP transport with no security mechanisms; the **WSHttpBinding** supports both transport-level and message-level security mechanisms.

 You can either use the **BasicHttpBinding** over an HTTPS connection, or use the **WSHttpBinding** to help protect your data. The [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)] includes the [!INCLUDE[afsvcdevwizlong](../../includes/afsvcdevwizlong-md.md)] to generate WCF service for LOB artifacts. This wizard only supports use of **BasicHttpBinding**.

 You can also develop a custom HTTP binding to leverage additional security mechanisms that your environment provides. For more information about the security features that [!INCLUDE[nextref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/nextref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] provides, see "Securing Services and Clients" at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89725](/dotnet/framework/wcf/feature-details/securing-services-and-clients).

## Security Best Practices for WCF Diagnostic Tracing and Message Logging
 [!INCLUDE[nextref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/nextref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] supports diagnostic tracing and message logging. You configure diagnostic tracing and message logging either through configuration files or by using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). Depending on the configuration options you set, [!INCLUDE[nextref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/nextref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] diagnostic tracing or message logging can emit sensitive information to log files, where it could potentially be exposed to observation by unauthorized users.

 Follow the recommendations provided in the WCF documentation to mitigate potential security threats exposed by enabling these features. At a minimum, you should observe the following best practices for diagnostic tracing and message logging:

- Do not enable “verbose” or “information” tracing in a production environment. This may lead to performance degradation. However, you must enable “warning” and “error” tracing in a production environment. If you enable tracing, you must take proper security measures to protect your data. See the WCF documentation for more information.

- Ensure that log files and configuration files are protected by access control lists (ACLs).

  The following warnings apply specifically to the messages that are exchanged between a client application and the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)]:

- [!INCLUDE[nextref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/nextref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] diagnostic tracing can log the header (but not the body) of messages exchanged with the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)]. Because the message action is in the message header, this reveals the operations invoked on the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] by the client.

- If [!INCLUDE[nextref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/nextref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] message logging is enabled and `logMessagesAtServiceLevel` is `true`, the message header (but not the message body) of messages exchanged between the adapter client and the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] are logged. Because the message action is in the message header, this reveals the operations that the client invoked on the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)]. If `logEntireMessage` is also `true`, the message body will be logged. This can reveal sensitive database information.
