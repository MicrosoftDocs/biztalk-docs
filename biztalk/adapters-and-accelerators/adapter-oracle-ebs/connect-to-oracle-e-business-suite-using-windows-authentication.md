# Connect to Oracle E-Business Suite using Windows Authentication
The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] enables adapter clients to use Windows Authentication to establish a connection with the Oracle E-Business Suite. To use Windows Authentication adapter clients must specify a “/” for user name and leave the password blank. For more information about connecting to the Oracle E-Business Suite using Windows Authentication, see [Connect to the Oracle E-Business Suite in Visual Studio](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/connect-to-the-oracle-e-business-suite-in-visual-studio.md).  

## What you need to know  
 To use Windows Authentication, you must do the following:  
  
-   If the **ClientCredentialType** property is set to **Database**, specify “/” for the user name and leave the password blank to connect to the Oracle E-Business Suite.  
  
-   If the **ClientCredentialType** property is set to **EBusiness**, specify the Oracle E-Business Suite credentials to connect. Also, you must specify “/” for the **OracleUserName** binding property and leave the **OraclePassword** binding property blank.  

## Enable Windows Authentication  
 To enable adapter clients to use Windows Authentication to connect to an Oracle database, you must perform the following tasks on the computer running the Oracle database.  
  
1.  Make sure that the `sqlnet.ora` file on both the client and the server, available under `ORACLE_BASE\ORACLE_HOME\network\admin\sqlnet.ora`, has the following entry:  
  
    ```  
    SQLNET.AUTHENTICATION_SERVICES= (NTS)  
    ```  
  
2.  Connect to the Oracle database as SYSDBA.  
  
3.  Create the Windows user as an external user in Oracle database. Note that the user name must be in upper case.  
  
    ```  
    CREATE USER “OPS$<DOMAIN_NAME>\<USER_NAME\>” IDENTIFIED EXTERNALLY;  
    ```  
  
4.  Grant privileges to the user.  
  
    ```  
    GRANT CONNECT,RESOURCE TO “OPS$<DOMAIN_NAME>\<USER_NAME\>”;  
    ```  
  
5.  The Oracle E-Business Suite artifacts are available under the APPS schema. To enable the newly created user, logging in using Windows Authentication, to access the Oracle E-Business Suite artifacts, the user’s schema must be changed to the APPS schema. You can add the following SQL command to the logon script that changes the user’s default schema to APPS when the user logs on.  
  
    ```  
    alter session set current_schema=APPS;  
    ```  
  
6.  Even though you changed the schema of the user to APPS schema, you will still not be able to see Oracle E-Business Suite artifacts while browsing and generating metadata using the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)]. This is because the newly created user does not have permissions for the APPS schema. Make sure you provided permission for the APPS schema for the newly created user.
