# Tutorial: Present data from Oracle E-Business Suite on a SharePoint Site
This tutorial provides detailed instructions on using the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] with Microsoft Office SharePoint Server to present data from Oracle E-Business Suite on a SharePoint portal. It also demonstrates how to configure a search application in the Microsoft Office SharePoint Server that allows you to do a full-text search from a SharePoint portal on the configured Oracle E-Business Suite artifact.  
  
 To demonstrate how to do so, consider a sample interface table in Oracle E-Business Suite that stores information about employees. In this tutorial, an application is created in Microsoft Office SharePoint Server that retrieve a list of customers from Oracle E-Business Suite based on a search string using:  
  
-   A Business Data List Web Part in Microsoft Office SharePoint Server  
  
-   The search feature in Microsoft Office SharePoint Server
