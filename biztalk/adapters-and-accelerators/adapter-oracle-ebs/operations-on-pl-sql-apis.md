# Operations on PL/SQL APIs

Oracle E-Business Suite provides a set of PL/SQL APIs in the form of packaged functions and stored procedures. These packaged functions and procedures are surfaced as operations in [!INCLUDE[adapteroracleebusinesslong](../../includes/adapteroracleebusinesslong-md.md)].

## PL/SQL APIs are grouped by schema names

The PL/SQL APIs are grouped by schema names under the **Artifact-Based View** and **Schema-Based View** nodes when you connect to Oracle E-Business Suite using [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservshort](../../includes/consumeadapterservshort-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[addadapterwiz](../../includes/addadapterwiz-md.md)] or  [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)]. For information about browsing the PL/SQL APIs in the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)], see [Browse, Search, and get Metadata for Oracle E-Business Operations](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/browse-search-and-get-metadata-for-oracle-e-business-suite-operations.md).

The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] displays the PL/SQL APIs associated with the Oracle database as well as the applications in Oracle E-Business Suite under the **Artifact-Based View** and **Schema-Based View** nodes.

## Important info

- Before you can perform operations on PL/SQL APIs associated with applications in Oracle E-Business Suite, you must set the applications context. This is because setting applications context facilitates secure transactions in Oracle E-Business Suite by setting user preferences (such as responsibility, organization, and language settings) and access control for an artifact. However, it is optional to set the applications context for PL/SQL APIs associated with Oracle database. See [Set Application Context](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/set-application-context.md).

- The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] cannot ascertain whether or not a default value is assigned for a parameter in a PL/SQL API in Oracle.  Moreover, the adapter also cannot ascertain whether a parameter is defined as mandatory or optional in a PL/SQL API in Oracle. The adapter treats every parameter as an optional parameter, and if no value is specified for a parameter that:

  - Has a default value specified in Oracle then the default value is used.
  - Is defined as a mandatory parameter in Oracle then an exception is thrown.
