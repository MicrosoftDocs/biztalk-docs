# Architecture overview of the BizTalk Adapter for Oracle E-Business Suite
The [!INCLUDE[adapteroracleebusinesslong](../../includes/adapteroracleebusinesslong-md.md)] is a [!INCLUDE[firstref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/firstref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] custom binding. This binding contains a single custom transport binding element that enables communication with an Oracle E-Business Suite. The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] is wrapped by the [!INCLUDE[afproductnamelong](../../includes/afproductnamelong-md.md)] runtime and is exposed to applications through the [!INCLUDE[nextref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/nextref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] channel architecture. The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] communicates with the Oracle E-Business Suite through the Oracle Data Provider for .NET (ODP.NET) and the Oracle client, which are part of the Oracle Data Access Components (ODAC) for Windows.

 The following figure shows the end-to-end architecture for solutions that are developed using the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)].

## Consuming the adapter
 The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] exposes the Oracle E-Business Suite as a [!INCLUDE[nextref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/nextref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] service to client applications. To perform operations and access data on the Oracle E-Business Suite, client applications exchange SOAP messages with the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[nextref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/nextref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] channels. The previous figure shows four ways in which the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] can be consumed. They are:

- Through a [!INCLUDE[nextref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/nextref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] channel model application. A [!INCLUDE[nextref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/nextref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] channel model application performs operations on the Oracle E-Business Suite by using the [!INCLUDE[nextref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/nextref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] channel model to exchange SOAP messages directly with the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)].

- Through a [!INCLUDE[nextref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/nextref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] service model application. A [!INCLUDE[nextref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/nextref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] service model application calls methods on a [!INCLUDE[nextref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/nextref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] client to perform operations on the Oracle E-Business Suite. A [!INCLUDE[nextref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/nextref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] client models the operations exposed by the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] as .NET methods. You can use the [!INCLUDE[afproductnamelong](../../includes/afproductnamelong-md.md)] or the WCF ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (svcutil.exe) to create a [!INCLUDE[nextref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/nextref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] client class from metadata exposed by the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)].

- Through a BizTalk receive location or send port that is configured to use the Microsoft BizTalk WCF-Custom adapter. The WCF-Custom adapter enables the use of [!INCLUDE[nextref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/nextref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] extensibility features. By using the WCF-Custom adapter you can select and configure the Oracle EBS Binding and the behavior for the receive location or send port. For more information about how to use the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] solutions, see [Develop BizTalk applications using the Oracle E-Business Suite adapter](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/develop-biztalk-applications-using-the-oracle-e-business-suite-adapter.md).

- Through an IIS-hosted Web service. In this scenario, a WCF service proxy generated by using the adapter is hosted in IIS using the basicHttpBinding WCF binding. This exposes the service contract as a Web service to external users. IIS automatically hosts the adapter at runtime, which, in turn, communicates with the Oracle E-Business Suite.

  The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] and ODAC are always hosted in-process with the application or service that consumes the adapter.

## Oracle EBS adapter and WCF
 [!INCLUDE[nextref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/nextref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] presents a programming model based on the exchange of SOAP messages over channels between clients and services. These messages are sent between endpoints exposed by a communicating client and service. An endpoint consists of:

- An *endpoint address*, which specifies the location at which messages are received

- A *binding*, which specifies the communication protocols used to exchange messages

- A *contract*, which specifies the operations and data types exposed by the endpoint.

  A binding consists of one or more binding elements that stack on top of each other to define how messages are exchanged with the endpoint. At a minimum, a binding must specify the transport and encoding that are used to exchange messages with the endpoint. Message exchange between endpoints occurs over a channel stack that is composed of one or more channels. Each channel is a concrete implementation of one of the binding elements in the binding configured for the endpoint. The [WCF documentation](/dotnet/framework/wcf/) includes more details about [!INCLUDE[nextref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/nextref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)], and the [!INCLUDE[nextref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/nextref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] programming model.

  The [!INCLUDE[adapteroracleebusinesslong](../../includes/adapteroracleebusinesslong-md.md)] exposes a [!INCLUDE[nextref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/nextref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] custom binding, the Oracle E-Business Suite Binding (**Microsoft.Adapters.OracleEBS.OracleEBSBinding**). By default, this binding contains a single custom transport binding element, the Oracle E-Business Suite Adapter Binding Element (**Microsoft.Adapters.OracleEBS.OracleEBSAdapter**), which enables operations on an Oracle E-Business Suite.

  **Microsoft.Adapters.OracleEBS.OracleEBSBinding** (the Oracle E-Business Suite Binding) and **Microsoft.Adapters.OracleEBS.OracleEBSAdapter** (the Oracle E-Business Suite Adapter Binding Element) are public classes and are also exposed to the configuration system. Because the Oracle E-Business Suite Adapter Binding Element is exposed publicly, you can build your own custom [!INCLUDE[nextref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/nextref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] bindings capable of extending the functionality of the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)]. For example, you could implement a custom binding to support Enterprise Single Sign-on (SSO) in a [!INCLUDE[nextref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/nextref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] channel or service model solution. The reasons for doing this would be to aggregate database operations into a single multifunction operation or to perform schema transformation between operations implemented by a custom application and operations on the Oracle E-Business Suite.

## Oracle EBS adapter and the WCF LOB SDK

 The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] is built on top of the [!INCLUDE[afproductnamelong](../../includes/afproductnamelong-md.md)], and runs on top of the [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)] runtime.


The [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)] provides a software framework and tooling infrastructure that the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] uses to provide a rich set of features to users and adapter clients.  It also serves as the software layer through which the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] interfaces with the [!INCLUDE[firstref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/firstref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)]. ODP.NET serves as the layer through which the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] interfaces with the Oracle database.

The following figure shows the relationships between the internal components of the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)], and ODP.NET:

 ![Oracle E&#45;Business adapter internal architecture](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/media/bts-oracleebs-architecture-internalc.gif "bts_OracleEBS_Architecture_Internalc")

## ODP.NET
 The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] connects with the Oracle E-Business Suite through the ODP.NET and the Oracle client. Both of these components are part of Oracle Data Access Components (ODAC).

 ODP.NET implements a data provider for the Oracle E-Business Suite that is consistent with the ADO.NET interface. The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] uses the classes exposed by ODP.NET to operate on the Oracle E-Business Suite.

 The Oracle client provides connectivity to the Oracle E-Business Suite. You establish a connection to an Oracle E-Business Suite by providing a connection URI to the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)]. You can specify the connection URI in two ways:

- **Using tnsnames.ora**. In this approach, the connection URI provided by the adapter client contains only the net service name specified in the tnsnames.ora file. The adapter extracts the connection parameters such as server name, service name, port number, etc. from the net service name entry in the file. To use this approach, the computer running the Oracle client must be configured to include the net service name for the Oracle database in the tnsnames.ora file.

- **Without using tnsnames.ora**. In this approach, the adapter clients specify the connection parameters directly in the connection URI. This does not require the net service name to be present in the tnsnames.ora file on the client computer. This approach does not even require the tnsnames.ora file to be present on the client computer.

  For more information about the connection URI, see [Create a connection to Oracle E-Business Suite](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/create-a-connection-to-oracle-e-business-suite.md).
