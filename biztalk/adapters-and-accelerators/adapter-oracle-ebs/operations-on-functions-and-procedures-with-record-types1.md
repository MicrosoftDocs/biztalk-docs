# Operations on Functions and Procedures with RECORD Types
Oracle RECORD types are used to represent hierarchical information in parameters passed to PL/SQL functions and procedures. The [!INCLUDE[adapteroracle](../../includes/adapteroracle-md.md)] surfaces RECORD types as complex XML types. 

## Supported RECORD types
The [!INCLUDE[adapteroracleebusinesslong](../../includes/adapteroracleebusinesslong-md.md)] supports the following kinds of RECORD types:  
  
- RECORD types that are declared as TABLE%ROWTYPE parameters in stored procedures and functions.  
  
- RECORD types that are declared as TYPE of RECORD parameters in PL/SQL packages. For example, TYPE rec_type1 IS RECORD(name varchar2(100), age number(3));  
  
- RECORD types that contain nested records.  
  
- RECORD types that appear as IN, OUT, or IN OUT parameters to procedures or functions.  
  
- RECORD types that are RETURN values of functions.  
  
  > [!NOTE]
  >  The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] does not support BFILE types as RECORD members.
