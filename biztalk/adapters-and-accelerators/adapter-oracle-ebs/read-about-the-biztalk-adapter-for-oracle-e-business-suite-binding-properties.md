# Read about the BizTalk Adapter for Oracle E-Business Suite binding properties
The [!INCLUDE[adapteroracleebusinesslong](../../includes/adapteroracleebusinesslong-md.md)] surfaces several binding properties. By setting these properties, you can control some of the adapter's behavior. This section describes the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] binding properties. It also shows how you can access them by using .NET programming or by setting properties on a [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] physical port binding.  
  
## The Adapter Binding Properties  
 The Oracle E-Business Suite is an application layer over the underlying Oracle database. Some binding properties configure the adapter’s behavior while interfacing with Oracle E-Business Suite, while other properties configure the behavior while interfacing with the Oracle database. The following table shows all the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] binding properties grouped by category. The category refers to the node under which each binding property appears in the dialog boxes that are presented by different applications to configure the adapter (or binding).  
  
|Binding Property|Category|Description|.NET Type|  
|----------------------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|  
|**ClientCredentialType**|General|Specifies which set of credentials are specified while establishing a connection with the Oracle E-Business Suite. The possible values are **Database** and **EBusiness**.<br /><br /> - If set to **Database**, adapter clients must specify the database credentials to establish the connection and the E-Business Suite credentials for the **OracleUserName** and **OraclePassword** binding properties.<br /><br /> - If set to **EBusiness**, adapter clients must specify the E-Business Suite credentials to establish the connection and the database credentials for the **OracleUserName** and **OraclePassword** binding properties.<br /><br /> **Important:** If **ClientCredentialType** binding property is set to **EBusiness**, specifying the database user name and password for **OracleUserName** and **OraclePassword** binding properties is mandatory.<br /><br /> Default is **Database**.|enum (ClientCredential)|  
|**CloseTimeout**|General|The [!INCLUDE[nextref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/nextref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] connection close timeout. Specifies a time span value that indicates the interval of time provided for the internal WCF channel close operation to complete. The default is 1 minute. Not supported.|System.TimeSpan|  
|**EnableBizTalkCompatibilityMode**|General|Specifies how the adapter generates schema for a DataSet. Set this to **True** to generate the schema for DataSet correctly.<br /><br /> When using the adapters from [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], you must always set the property to **True**. When using the adapters from [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)], you must always set the property to **False**.|bool (System.Boolean)|  
|**InboundOperationType**|General|Specifies whether you want to perform **Polling** or **Notification** inbound operation. Default is **Polling**.<br /><br /> For more information about **Polling** see [Support for Inbound Calls Using Polling](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/support-for-inbound-calls-using-polling.md). For more information about **Notification**, see [Considerations for Receiving Database Change Notifications Using the Oracle Database adapter](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-database/before-you-receive-database-change-notifications-using-the-oracle-db-adapter.md).|enum|  
|**Name**|General|A read-only value that returns the name of the file generated by the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservreflong](../../includes/addadapterservreflong-md.md)] to hold the [!INCLUDE[nextref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/nextref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] client class. The [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)] forms the file name by appending "Client" to the value of the **Name** property. The value returned is "OracleEBSBinding"; for this value, the generated file will be named "OracleEBSBindingClient".|string|  
|**OpenTimeout**|General|The [!INCLUDE[nextref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/nextref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] connection open timeout. Specifies a time span value that indicates the interval of time provided for the internal channel open operation to complete. The default is 1 minute.<br /><br /> **Important:** The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] always uses **OpenTimeout** to set the connection open timeout when it opens a connection to the Oracle database. The adapter ignores any timeout (**System.TimeSpan**) parameters passed when you open a communication object, such as a channel.|System.TimeSpan|  
|**ReceiveTimeout**|General|The [!INCLUDE[nextref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/nextref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] message receive timeout. Specifies a time span value that indicates the maximum interval of time for which the adapter waits for an inbound message. The default is 10 minutes.<br /><br /> **Important:** For inbound operations such as polling, we recommend setting the timeout to the maximum possible value, which is 24.20:31:23.6470000 (24 days). When using the adapter with [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], setting the timeout to a large value does not impact the functionality of the adapter.|System.TimeSpan|  
|**SendTimeout**|General|The [!INCLUDE[nextref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/nextref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] message send timeout. Specifies a time span value that indicates the interval of time provided for the internal channel send operation to complete. The default is 5 minute.|System.TimeSpan|  
|**UseAmbientTransaction**|General|Specifies whether the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] performs the operations using the transaction context provided by the caller. Default is **true**, which means that the adapter always performs the operations in a transaction context, assuming that the client is providing the transactional context. If there are other resources participating in the transaction, the connections created enlist in System.Transaction and are elevated to an MSDTC transaction.<br /><br /> However, there can be scenarios where you do not want the adapter to perform operations in a transactional context. For example:<br /><br /> - While performing a simple SELECT operation on the Oracle database (on a send port)<br /><br /> - While specify a polling statement that performs a SELECT operation and does not involve any changes to the table either through a DELETE statement or by invoking a stored procedure (on a receive port)<br /><br /> Both these operations do not make any updates to the database table and hence, elevating these operations to use an MSDTC transaction can be a performance overhead. In such scenarios, you can set the binding property to **false** so that the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] does not perform the operations in a transaction context.<br /><br /> **Note:** Not performing operations in a transactional context is advisable only for operations that do not make changes to the database. For operations that update data in the database, we recommend setting the binding property to true otherwise you might either experience message loss or duplicate messages depending on whether you are performing inbound or outbound operations.|bool (System.Boolean)|  
|**DataFetchSize**|Buffer management|ODP.NET property. Specifies the amount of data in bytes that ODP.NET fetches from the result set in one server roundtrip. The default is 65536. This property is used for performance tuning.|long (System.Int64)|  
|**InsertBatchSize**|Buffer management|Specifies the batch size for multiple record Insert operations. The default is 20. For values of **InsertBatchSize** greater than one, the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] batches the specified number of records into a single ODP.NET call. If the number of records in the Insert operation is not a multiple of the batch size, the final batch will contain fewer records than the batch size value. For example, if the insert message has 10 records and the **InsertBatchSize** is set to 1, the adapter reads individual records and writes them into the Oracle database. So, the adapter performs 10 separate operations on the Oracle database. Similarly, if the insert message has 10 records and the **InsertBatchSize** is set to 5, the adapter will read and write 5 records at a time into the Oracle database, therefore performing only 2 insert operations.<br /><br /> A well-chosen value for **InsertBatchSize** can greatly improve adapter performance for multiple record Insert operations.|int (System.Int32)|  
|**LongDatatypeColumnSize**|Buffer management|Specifies the maximum size in bytes of an Oracle long data type column. The maximum value of this binding property can be 32512. The default is 0. You must use the default value if you are not performing operation on long data type. You must explicitly set an appropriate value for this binding property if you are:<br /><br /> - Executing a stored procedure that contains parameters of long data type.<br /><br /> - Performing a Select operation on a table that contains columns with long data type, and the SELECT statement does not include the primary key column.<br /><br /> If you want to set the maximum value for this binding property, set the value to **-1**.<br /><br /> **Note:** This binding property is deprecated.|int|  
|**MaxOutputAssociativeArrayElements**|Buffer management|Specifies the size of the associate array that the adapter creates when performing operations that return an associative array in the response. The adapter communicates the size of the array to ODP.NET, which in turn creates a buffer depending on the array size. Default is 32.<br /><br /> This binding property is useful when performing operations involving PL/SQL table types.|int (System.Int32)|  
|**MetadataPooling**|Buffer management|ODP.NET property. Specifies whether ODP.NET caches metadata information for executed queries. The default is **true**, which enables metadata pooling. Caching this information improves performance; however, if changes to the underlying Oracle artifacts occur on the Oracle system, this pooled metadata will be out of sync. This might cause operations performed on the Oracle system to return unexpected exceptions. This property is used for performance tuning.|bool (System.Boolean)|  
|**StatementCachePurge**|Buffer management|ODP.NET property. Specifies whether the ODP.NET statement cache associated with a connection is purged when the connection is returned to the connection pool. The default is **false**, which disables statement cache purging. This property is used for performance tuning.|bool (System.Boolean)|  
|**StatementCacheSize**|Buffer management|ODP.NET property. Specifies the maximum number of statements that can be cached by each ODP.NET connection. Setting this property to a non-zero value enables statement caching for connections. The default is 10. This property is used for performance tuning.|int (System.Int32)|  
|**OracleConnectionClientId**|Debug|Specifies a client identifier (ID) for the connection used by the adapter to connect to Oracle. This is useful if you have enabled Oracle server-side tracing, and want to selectively trace the operations for a particular client ID. This also allows you to filter and view the Oracle server traces based on a client ID.|String|  
|**EnablePerformanceCounters**|Diagnostics|Specifies whether to enable the [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)] performance counters and the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] LOB Latency performance counter. The default is **False**; performance counters are disabled. The LOB Latency performance counter measures the total time spent by the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] in making calls to Oracle E-Business Suite.|bool (System.Boolean)|  
|**EnableSafeTyping**|Metadata|Enables or disables safe typing. The default is **false**; safe typing is disabled. This feature controls how the adapter surfaces certain Oracle data types. For more information about safe typing, see [Basic Oracle Data Types](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/basic-oracle-data-types2.md).|bool (System.Boolean)|  
|**UseSchemaInNameSpace**|Metadata|Specifies whether the schema name (SCOTT, HR, and so on) is included in the xml namespace for operations and their associated types on the underlying database artifacts. The default is **True**; the schema name is included in the namespace. The advantage of not having scheme name included in the namespace is that if there is a table with same name (for example, EMP) in two different schemas then the same XML can be used to perform the simple SQL operations (Insert, Update, Delete, Select) on both tables.<br /><br /> For example, if the **UseSchemaInNamespace** property is true, the namespace for these operations on the SCOTT.EMP table is "http://schemas.microsoft.com/OracleEBS/Tables/SCOTT/EMP"; if it is false, the namespace is "http://schemas.microsoft.com/OracleEBS/Tables/EMP ".<br /><br /> **Important:** The message action is not affected by the **UseSchemaInNamesapce** binding property; it always includes the schema name.<br /><br /> **Important:** We strongly recommend setting this binding property to **True** while generating metadata. If you set this property to false, the Oracle schema names (for example, SCOTT) will not be available in the XML namespace of the generated schema. So, if there are two tables with the same name in two different Oracle schemas, and they are added to the same BizTalk project, the BizTalk project will fail to build and deploy. If you want to include such schemas in the same BizTalk project, you must manually edit them to include the Oracle schema name in the XML namespace.|bool (System.Boolean)|  
|**MlsSettings**|Multi Language Support|An Oracle E-Business Suite instance can have multiple language packs installed. So, if the adapter is retrieving metadata from an Oracle E-Business Suite instance that has multi-language support (MLS), the adapter must present information with the same language setting as the logged in user prefers.<br /><br /> The **MlsSettings** binding property enables adapter clients to specify the MLS-specific options. This binding property can be specified both at design time and run time. The **MlsSettings** binding property is a complex binding property that in turn contains more binding properties. All these binding properties are optional. The adapter uses the binding properties in the following manner to set the MLS context:<br /><br /> - For binding properties that have values specified, the adapter uses those values to set the MLS context.<br /><br /> - For binding properties that do not have values specified, the adapter uses the MLS settings for the ODP.NET client on the same computer where the adapter is installed.<br /><br /> Following table lists the binding properties that are part of the **MlsSettings** binding property. All these properties are optional.<br /><br /> **Calendar**: Specifies the calendar system. This binding property maps to the NLS_CALENDAR setting in the ODP.NET client.<br /><br /> **Comparison**: Specifies a method of comparison for the WHERE clauses and comparison in PL/SQL blocks. This binding property maps to the NLS_COMP setting in the ODP.NET client.<br /><br /> **Currency**: Specifies the string to use as a local currency symbol for the L number format element. For information about the various number format elements and format models in Oracle, see [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=135807](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=135807). This binding property maps to the NLS_CURRENCY setting in the ODP.NET client.<br /><br /> **DateFormat**:Specifies the format in which the date is presented. This binding property maps to the NLS_DATE_FORMAT setting in the ODP.NET client.<br /><br /> **DateLanguage**: Specifies the language for day and month names. This binding property maps to the NLS_DATE_LANGUAGE setting in the ODP.NET client<br /><br /> **DualCurrency**: Specifies the dual currency symbol, such as Euro, for the U number format element. For information about the various number format elements and format models in Oracle, see [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=135807](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=135807). This binding property maps to the NLS_DUAL_CURRENCY setting in the ODP.NET client.<br /><br /> **ISOCurrency**:Specifies the string to use as an international currency symbol for the C number format element. For information about the various number format elements and format models in Oracle, see [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=135807](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=135807). This binding property maps to the NLS_ISO_CURRENCY setting in the ODP.NET client.<br /><br /> **Language**: Specifies the language to be set as part of MLS context. This binding property maps to the NLS_LANGUAGE setting in the ODP.NET client.<br /><br /> **Important:** The value for the **OracleEBSResponsibilityName** binding property must be specified in the same language as specified for the **Language** binding property. For example, if you set the **Language** binding property to Spanish, the responsibility name you specify for the **OracleEBSResponsibilityName** binding property must also be in Spanish.<br /><br /> **LengthSemantics**: Enables creation of CHAR and VARCHAR2 columns using either byte or character (default) length semantics. This binding property maps to the NLS_LENGTH_SEMANTICS setting in the ODP.NET client.<br /><br /> **NCharConversionException**: Specifies whether the data loss during an implicit or explicit character type conversion reports an error or not. The default is **True**. This binding property maps to the NLS_NCHAR_CONV_EXCP setting in the ODP.NET client.<br /><br /> **NumericCharacters**: Specifies the decimal character and group separator. This binding property maps to the NLS_NUMERIC_CHARACTERS setting in the ODP.NET client.<br /><br /> **Sort**:                       Specifies the type of sort for character data. This binding property maps to the NLS_SORT setting in the ODP.NET client.<br /><br /> **Territory**: Specifies the conventions of date and numeric format for a territory. This binding property maps to the NLS_TERRITORY setting in the ODP.NET client.<br /><br /> **TimeStampFormat**: Specifies the string format for TimeStamp data types. This binding property maps to the NLS_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT setting in the ODP.NET client.<br /><br /> **TimeStampTZFormat**:                       Specifies the string format for TimeStampTZ data types. This binding property maps to the NLS_TIMESTAMP_TZ_FORMAT setting in the ODP.NET client.<br /><br /> **TimeZone**:                        Specifies the time zone region name.  This binding property maps to the TIME_ZONE setting in the ODP.NET client.|enum|  
|**NotificationPort**|Notification|Specifies the port number that ODP.NET must open to listen for database change notification from Oracle database. Default is -1, which signifies that ODP.NET uses a valid, random, unused port number.<br /><br /> **Important:** Adapter clients will not receive database change notifications if Windows Firewall is turned on. Also, turning off Windows Firewall to receive notifications is not advisable. So, to receive notifications without compromising the security of the client-side computers, we recommend specifying a positive integer value as a port number and then adding that port number to the Windows Firewall exceptions list. If you set this binding property to the default value of -1, ODP.NET uses a random port and adapter clients will not know which port to add to Windows Firewall exceptions list. For instructions on how to add ports to Windows Firewall exceptions list, see [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=196959](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=196959).<br /><br /> **Caution:** If there is more than one application in an application domain receiving notifications using the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)], the **NotificationPort** binding property for all applications must be set to the same port number. This is because ODP.NET creates only one listener that listens on one port within an application domain.|int (System.Int32)|  
|**NotificationStatement**|Notification|Specifies the SELECT statement used to register for getting notifications from Oracle database. An example SELECT statement could resemble the following.<br /><br /> `SELECT TID,ACCOUNT,PROCESSED FROM SCOTT.ACCOUNTACTIVITY WHERE PROCESSED = ‘n’`<br /><br /> **Note:** You must specify the database object name along with the schema name. For example, `SCOTT.ACCOUNTACTIVITY`.<br /><br /> The adapter gets a notification message from Oracle database only when the result set for the specified SELECT statement changes.|string|  
|**NotifyOnListenerStart**|Notification|Specifies whether the adapter sends a notification message to the adapter clients, informing that the receive location is running, when the listener starts. Default is **True**.|bool (System.Boolean)|  
|**ConnectionLifetime**|Oracle Connection Pool|ODP.NET property. Specifies the maximum duration in seconds of a connection. The default is 0. This property is used for performance tuning.|int (System.Int32)|  
|**DecrPoolSize**|Oracle Connection Pool|ODP.NET property. Specifies the number of connections that are closed when an excessive amount of established connections are not in use. The default is 1. This is used for performance tuning.|int (System.Int32)|  
|**IncrPoolSize**|Oracle Connection Pool|ODP.NET property. Specifies the number of new connections to be created when a new connection is requested and there are no available connections in the ODP.NET connection pool. The default is 5. This property is used for performance tuning.|int (System.Int32)|  
|**MaxPoolSize**|Oracle Connection Pool|ODP.NET property. Specifies the maximum number of connections in an ODP.NET connection pool. The default is 100. This property is used for performance tuning.<br /><br /> **Important:** You must set **MaxPoolSize** judiciously. It is possible to exhaust the number of connections available from ODP.NET, if this value is set too large.|int (System.Int32)|  
|**MinPoolSize**|Oracle Connection Pool|ODP.NET property. Specifies the minimum number of connections in an ODP.NET connection pool. The default is 1. This property is used for performance tuning.|int (System.Int32)|  
|**UseOracleConnectionPool**|Oracle Connection Pool|ODP.NET property. Specifies whether to use the ODP.NET connection pool. The default is **true**, which enables connection pooling. The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] implements connection pooling by using the ODP.NET connection pool.|bool (System.Boolean)|  
|**ApplicationShortName**|OracleEBS|The short name for an Oracle E-Business Suite application. You must provide the application short name while setting the application context for certain PL/SQL APIs, and database tables or views. But, why do we need to set the application context for only certain PL/SQL APIs, and database tables or views?<br /><br /> - The PL/SQL APIs, both associated with the Oracle database and the applications in the Oracle E-Business Suite, are also available under the “Artifact-Based View” and the Schema-Based View” node at design-time while using the [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservshort](../../includes/consumeadapterservshort-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)]. While executing the PL/SQL APIs associated with the Oracle database, you need not set this binding property. However, while executing a PL/SQL API associated with an Oracle E-Business Suite application, you must set the application context by specifying a valid value for this binding property.<br /><br /> - For custom Oracle E-Business Suite applications, users may or may not register the base database tables as interface tables. If a database table is not registered as an interface table, it will be available under the “Database” node at design-time while using the [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservshort](../../includes/consumeadapterservshort-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)]. However, because these tables are associated with an Oracle E-Business application, for any operation on these tables you must set the application context.<br /><br /> So, to perform any operation on a PL/SQL API, and database tables or views belonging to the Oracle E-Business Suite, you must always specify the application short name.<br /><br /> **Important:** While executing a PL/SQL API or performing any operation on database tables or views associated with an Oracle E-Business Suite application, you must also:<br /><br /> - Set the **ClientCredentialType** binding property to **EBusiness**,<br /><br /> - Set the **OracleUserName**, **OraclePassword** binding properties to specify the credentials to connect to the Oracle E-Business Suite, and<br /><br /> - Set the **OracleEBSResponsibilityName** binding property to the appropriate responsibility name.<br /><br /> By setting these binding properties you inform the adapter that the PL/SQL API, or the database table or view, you are operating on is associated with an Oracle E-Business Suite application and hence the **ApplicationShortName** binding property becomes mandatory. On the contrary if you are executing a PL/SQL API, or any operation on database tables or views, associated with an Oracle E-Business Suite application, and you do not set the **ClientCredentialType**, **OracleUserName**, **OraclePassword**, and **OracleEBSResponsibilityName** binding properties appropriately, the adapter ignores the **ApplicationShortName**, even if it is set, and assumes that the PL/SQL API or the database table you are performing operations on belongs to the Oracle database.|string|  
|**OracleEBSOrganizationId**|OracleEBS|Specifies the organization ID to which an Oracle E-Business Suite application belongs. This property is optional and is considered only when:<br /><br /> - The **ClientCredentialType** binding property is set to **EBusiness**, and<br /><br /> - The **OracleUserName**, **OraclePassword**, and **OracleEBSResponsibilityName** binding properties are specified appropriately.|string|  
|**OracleEBSResponsibilityKey**|OracleEBS|The responsibility key associated with the Oracle E-Business Suite user.<br /><br /> Unlike the responsibility name (**OracleEBSResponsibilityName** binding property), the responsibility key is not dependent on the language specified. It implies that you do not have to specify responsibility keys in different languages depending on the value specified in the **Language** binding property while setting the MLS context.<br /><br /> **Important:**<br /><br /> - The value specified for the **OracleEBSResponsibilityKey** binding property overrides the value specified for the **OracleEBSResponsibilityName** binding property.<br /><br /> - If you will be performing operations on the data in multiple languages and do not want to specify a responsibility name in each language, you should specify a value for this binding property while performing operations on interface tables, selecting values from interface views, or executing a concurrent program or request set. Of course, you can always use this binding property even if you are working only with data in the English language.|string|  
|**OracleEBSResponsibilityName**|OracleEBS|The name of the responsibility associated with the Oracle E-Business Suite user.<br /><br /> The responsibility name is dependent on the language specified. It implies that if you are setting the MLS context by specifying a value for the **Language** binding property, the value for the **OracleEBSResponsibilityName** binding property must be specified in the same language as specified for the **Language** binding property. For example, if you set the **Language** binding property to Spanish, the responsibility name you specify for the **OracleEBSResponsibilityName** binding property must also be in Spanish.<br /><br /> **Important:** You must specify a value for this binding property while performing operations on interface tables, selecting values from interface views, or executing a concurrent program.|string|  
|**OraclePassword**|OracleEBS|- If the **ClientCredentialType** binding property is set to **Database**, this property specifies the password for an Oracle database user.<br /><br /> - If the **ClientCredentialType** binding property is set to **EBusiness**, this property specifies the password for an Oracle E-Business Suite user.<br /><br /> The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] does not preserve the case of the value that you enter for the **OraclePassword** binding property when it connects to Oracle E-Business Suite. The password is passed to Oracle E-Business Suite using the standard rules of SQL\*Plus. However, if you want the case of the password to be preserved or if you want to enter a password containing special characters, you must specify the value within double quotes.<br /><br /> **Important:**<br /><br /> - While performing operations on interface tables, selecting values from interface views, executing a concurrent program, or executing a PL/SQL API associated with an Oracle E-Business Suite application you must set the **ClientCredentialType** binding property to **EBusiness** and then specify a valid password to connect to Oracle E-Business Suite.<br /><br /> - The **OraclePassword** binding property is not available in the binding file (XML file) or the app.config file generated as a result of using the [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservlong](../../includes/consumeadapterservlong-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservreflong](../../includes/addadapterservreflong-md.md)].|string|  
|**OracleUserName**|OracleEBS|- If the **ClientCredentialType** binding property is set to **Database**, this property specifies the user name for authentication on the Oracle database.<br /><br /> - If the **ClientCredentialType** binding property is set to **EBusiness**, this property specifies the user name for authentication on the Oracle E-Business Suite.<br /><br /> The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] does not preserve the case of the value that you enter for the **OracleUserName** binding property when it connects to Oracle E-Business Suite. The user name is passed to Oracle E-Business Suite using the standard rules of SQL\*Plus. However, if you want the case of the user name to be preserved or if you want to enter a user name containing special characters, you must specify the value within double quotes.<br /><br /> **Important:** While performing operations on interface tables, selecting values from interface views, executing a concurrent program, or executing a PL/SQL API associated with an Oracle E-Business Suite application you must set the **ClientCredentialType** binding property to **EBusiness** and then specify a valid user name to connect to Oracle E-Business Suite.|string|  
|**PolledDataAvailableStatement**|Polling|Specifies the SELECT statement executed to determine whether any data is available for polling for a specific table. The specified statement must return a result set consisting of rows and columns. The value in the first cell of the result set indicates whether the adapter executes the value specified for the **PollingInput** binding property. If the first cell of the result contains a positive value, the adapter executes the polling statement. For example, a valid statement for this binding property will be:<br /><br /> `Select * from <table_name>`<br /><br /> **Tip:** If you want the adapter to continue polling irrespective of whether the table being polled has data, you can specify the value for this binding property as `Select 1 FROM DUAL`.<br /><br /> **Note:** You must not specify stored procedures for this binding property. Also, this statement must not modify the underlying Oracle database.|string|  
|**PollingAction**|Polling|Specifies the action for the polling operation. You can determine the polling action for a specific operation from the metadata you generate for the operation using the [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservshort](../../includes/consumeadapterservshort-md.md)].|string|  
|**PollingInput**|Polling|Specifies the polling statement. You can specify a simple SELECT statement or a stored procedure for polling. If you want to poll a table or view, you must specify a SELECT statement for this binding property. If you want to poll using a stored procedure, you must specify the entire request message for this binding property. The request message must be the same that you send to the adapter for invoking the stored procedure as an outbound operation.<br /><br /> **Note:** The SQL statement or the stored procedure specified for this binding property is executed only if the statement executed by the **PolledDataAvailableStatement** binding property returns some data.<br /><br /> **Important:** The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] executes the polling statement and the post-poll statement (if specified) inside of an Oracle transaction. If you are using a SELECT statement in the **PollingInput** binding property, we recommend that you specify a FOR UPDATE clause in your SELECT statement. This will ensure that the selected records are locked during the transaction and that the post-poll statement can perform any required updates on the selected records.|string|  
|**PollingInterval**|Polling|Specifies the transacted polling interval, that is, the interval in seconds at which the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] executes the statement you specified for **PollingInput** binding property against the Oracle database. The default is 30. The polling interval is used by the adapter for the following:<br /><br /> - The time interval between successive polls. This interval is used to run the poll and post-poll queries. If these queries are executed within the specified interval, the adapter sleeps for the remaining time in the interval.<br /><br /> - The polling transaction timeout value. This value must be set large enough to include the polling statement execution time, the post-poll statement (if specified) execution time, and the time to receive the reply from the client application to commit the transaction.<br /><br /> If the client application sends a reply before the polling interval expires, the adapter commits the transaction and waits until the polling interval is reached to execute the next poll.<br /><br /> If the client application returns a fault, the adapter terminates the transaction.<br /><br /> If the polling interval expires before the client application sends the reply, the transaction will time out.|int (System.Int32)|  
|**PollWhileDataFound**|Polling|Specifies whether the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] ignores the polling interval and continuously polls the Oracle database, if data is available in the table being polled. If no data is available in the table, the adapter reverts to execute the SQL statement at the specified polling interval. Default is **false**.<br /><br /> Consider a scenario where the polling interval is set to 60 seconds, and the statement specified for **PolledDataAvailableStatement** returns that data is available for polling. The adapter then executes the statement specified for the **PollingInput** binding property. Assuming that the adapter takes just 10 seconds to execute the statement, it will now have to wait for 50 seconds before executing the **PolledDataAvailableStatement** again, and then subsequently execute the polling statement. Instead, to optimize the performance you can set the **PollWhileDataFound** binding property to **true** so that the adapter can start executing the next polling cycle as soon as the previous polling cycle ends.<br /><br /> **Note:** This binding property is applicable both for polling on tables and views and polling using stored procedure.|string|  
|**PostPollStatement**|Polling|Specifies a statement block that is executed after the statement specified by the **PollingInput** binding property is executed. The default is **null**; no post-poll statement is executed. The post-poll statement executes inside the polling transaction. Two common uses for the post-poll statement are to:<br /><br /> - Update a column in the rows returned in the polling statement to indicate that they have been processed and should be excluded from subsequent polling queries.<br /><br /> - Move processed records to a different table.<br /><br /> **Important:** If a post-poll statement is specified, **PollingInterval** should be set large enough for the post-poll statement to complete before the interval expires.<br /><br /> For more information about how to use binding properties in a polling scenario, see Overview of Polling-based Data-changed Notifications.|string|  
|**SkipNilNodes**|Run Time Behavior|Specifies whether the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] will skip inserting or updating values for nodes that are marked as ‘nil’ in the request XML. This binding property is applicable for inserting or updating records in a table and for RECORD type parameters in stored procedures. Default is **true**, which means the adapter will skip passing values for nodes that are marked as ‘nil’. In this case, the default value in Oracle (if specified) is taken into account for nodes that are marked as ‘nil’. If set to **false**, the adapter explicitly passes a null value for these nodes.<br /><br /> **Note:**<br /><br /> - For nodes that are not present in the request XML, the adapter always skips passing values, irrespective of the value of the **SkipNilNodes** binding property.<br /><br /> - For PL/SQL tables of RECORDS, the adapter always passes a null value for nodes that are either marked as ‘nil’ or not present in the request XML, irrespective of the value of the **SkipNilNodes** binding property.<br /><br /> The following example explains the difference in the adapter configuration based on the value you set for this binding property. Assume a request XML resembles the following:<br /><br /> `<EMPNO>1000</EMPNO> <ENAME>John</ENAME> <SAL nil=’true’></SAL>`<br /><br /> If **SkipNilNodes** is set to **true**, the adapter executes the following command:<br /><br /> `INSERT INTO EMP (EMPNO, ENAME) VALUES (1000, “John”);`<br /><br /> If **SkipNilNodes** is set to **false**, the adapter executes the following query:<br /><br /> `INSERT INTO EMP (EMPNO, ENAME, SAL) VALUES (1000, “John”, null);`<br /><br /> Note that in the second statement, the adapter explicitly inserts a null value for the parameter “SAL”.|bool (System.Boolean)|  
|**GeneratedUserTypesAssemblyFilePath**|UDT .NET Type Generation – Design Time|Specifies the name and path of the DLL that the adapter generates, while generating metadata, containing all UDTs that are used in the metadata. You must specify a DLL name if you are generating metadata for packages, stored procedures, or functions that use UDTs. Specifying the DLL name is optional for tables and views that have UDTs. The generated DLL is saved to the same location as the executable.<br /><br /> This binding property is required only while generating metadata.<br /><br /> **Note:**<br /><br /> - You must specify only one filename. For all the UDTs in the metadata, the adapter generates a single file with the given name. If you do not specify a name, the adapter generates the DLL with a GUID name.<br /><br /> - This binding property is not available in BizTalk Server while configuring a **WCF-OracleEBS** receive or send port.|string|  
|**GeneratedUserTypesAssemblyKeyFilePath**|UDT .NET Type Generation – Design Time|Specifies the name and path of the key file that the adapter uses to create a strongly-typed assembly.<br /><br /> This binding property is optional and is required only while generating metadata.<br /><br /> **Note:** This binding property is not available in BizTalk Server while configuring a **WCF-OracleEBS** receive or send port.|string|  
|**UserAssembliesLoadPath**|UDT .NET Type Generation – Run Time|Specifies the name of the DLLs, separated by a semi-colon, which the adapter creates while generating metadata. These DLLs are saved at the location you specified for the **GeneratedUserTypesAssemblyFilePath** binding property while generating metadata. You must manually copy these DLLs to the following locations:<br /><br /> -                      **For BizTalk projects**: Copy the DLLs at the same location as BTSNTSvc.exe. For [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)], this is available typically under \<installation drive\>:\Program Files\Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)].<br /><br /> - **For .NET Projects**: Copy the DLLs to the \bin\Development folder within your .NET project folder.<br /><br /> This binding property is required only while sending and receiving messages to perform operations on the Oracle E-Business Suite.|string|  
|**AcceptCredentialsInUri**|Not surfaced by the [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservshort](../../includes/consumeadapterservshort-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)].|Specifies whether the Oracle E-Business Suite connection URI can contain user credentials. The default is **false**, which disables user credentials in the connection URI. If **AcceptCredentialsInUri** is **false** and the Oracle connection URI contains user credentials, the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] throws an exception. You can set **AcceptCredentialsInUri** to **true** if you must specify credentials in the URI. For more information, see [Create the Oracle E-Business Suite connection URI
](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/create-the-oracle-e-business-suite-connection-uri.md).|bool (System.Boolean)|  
  
## How Do I Set the Binding Properties?  
 You can set the binding properties when you specify a connection to the Oracle E-Business Suite. For information about how to set binding properties when you:  
  
-   Use the [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservlong](../../includes/consumeadapterservlong-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservreflong](../../includes/addadapterservreflong-md.md)], see [enter link description here](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/connect-to-the-oracle-e-business-suite-in-visual-studio.md).  
  
-   Configure a send port or receive port (location) in a [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] solution, see [Manually Configuring a Physical Port Binding to the Oracle E-Business Adapter](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/manually-configure-a-physical-port-binding-to-the-oracle-e-business-adapter.md).  
  
-   Use the WCF channel model in a programming solution, see [Connect to the Oracle E-Business Suite in Visual Studio](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/create-a-channel-using-oracle-e-business-suite.md).  
  
-   Use the WCF service model in a programming solution, see [Connect to the Oracle E-Business Suite in Visual Studio](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/configure-a-client-binding-for-the-oracle-e-business-suite.md).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  While using the [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservlong](../../includes/consumeadapterservlong-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservreflong](../../includes/addadapterservreflong-md.md)], if you do not specify a value for a binding property of type string and whose default value is null then that binding property will not be available in the binding file (an XML file) or the app.config file respectively. You must manually add the binding property and its value in the binding file or the app.config file, if required.  
>   
>  However, the **OraclePassword** binding property is not available in the binding file or the app.config file even if you specify a value for this binding property while using the [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservlong](../../includes/consumeadapterservlong-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservreflong](../../includes/addadapterservreflong-md.md)].
