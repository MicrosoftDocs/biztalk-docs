# Get started with the BizTalk Adapter for Oracle E-Business Suite
Overview of the adapter, prerequisites, and topics for users who are new to Microsoft BizTalk Adapter Pack. Information is provided about the features of [!INCLUDE[adapteroracleebusinesslong](../../includes/adapteroracleebusinesslong-md.md)] and the different operations that can be performed on the Oracle database by using the adapter.  
  
## What is an adapter?  
  
 An adapter is a software component that enables you to send and receive messages to and from a line-of-business (LOB) system. The primary goal of an adapter is to facilitate the exchange of business documents between trading partners. Because each business system may adhere to specific document formats and protocols, the adapter must use a delivery mechanism that conforms to commonly recognized standards and protocols to provide a uniform interface to the users.  
  
 The adapters in the [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)] can be divided into two broad categories:  
  
- **LOB adapters**: LOB adapters provide a service-oriented programming model to access LOB systems—for example, adapters for SAP or Siebel applications.  
  
- **Data adapters**: Data adapters provide a service-oriented programming model to access databases — for example, adapters for the Oracle database or SQL Server.  
  
  There are five adapters in the [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)]:  
  
- [!INCLUDE[adapteroracleebusinesslong](../../includes/adapteroracleebusinesslong-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)])  
  
- [!INCLUDE[adaptersql](../../includes/adaptersql-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)])  
  
- [!INCLUDE[adapteroracle](../../includes/adapteroracle-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[adapteroracle_short](../../includes/adapteroracle-short-md.md)])  
  
- [!INCLUDE[adaptersap](../../includes/adaptersap-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)])  
  
- [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel](../../includes/adaptersiebel-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)])  
  
  > [!NOTE]
  >  The [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)] is not available for 64-bit platforms.  
  
  If you are new to the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)], then we recommend you start by exploring the features and functionality of the adapter described in [Understand BizTalk Adapter for Oracle E-Business Suite](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/understand-biztalk-adapter-for-oracle-e-business-suite.md).
