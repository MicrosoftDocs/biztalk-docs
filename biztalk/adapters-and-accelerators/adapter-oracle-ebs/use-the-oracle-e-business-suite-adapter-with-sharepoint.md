# Use the Oracle E-Business Suite adapter with SharePoint
Most line-of-business (LOB) applications have proprietary interfaces that are accessible to relatively few people with the required subject matter expertise. However, because information workers need relevant information at all levels in an organization, the subject matter experts have to export required data into more familiar applications, like Microsoft Excel, for information workers to consume the information.  
  
 The new collection of Microsoft Office client applications and features bridges this gap by bringing backend business data into the most common interface for information workers, Microsoft Office. Microsoft Office client applications seamlessly present data from LOB applications through interfaces familiar to information workers. One example is the Business Data Catalog in Microsoft Office SharePoint Server.
