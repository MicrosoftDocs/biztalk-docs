# Invoke concurrent programs in Oracle E-Business Suite using the WCF service model
Oracle E-Business Suite exposes concurrent programs that you can execute to perform specific operations on Oracle applications. Each Oracle application has a set of standard concurrent programs (that are same across all operations) and certain concurrent programs that are specific to an Oracle application. The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] exposes all concurrent programs as operations that adapter clients can invoke. For more information about how the adapter supports concurrent programs, see [Operations on Concurrent Programs](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/operations-on-concurrent-programs.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  For the concurrent programs that do not expose their metadata, the Oracle E-Business adapter exposes 100 optional parameters for each of these concurrent programs. To invoke these concurrent programs successfully, the user must consult the Oracle E-Business Suite documentation to figure out the parameters for a concurrent program that require a value, and then specify them. An example of such a concurrent program is **Journal Import** (actual name: **GLLEZL**) in the **General Ledger** application.  
  
## About the Examples Used in this Topic  
 The example in this topic invokes the **MS_SAMPLE_COPY_EMP_DATA** concurrent program, followed by the **Get_Status** concurrent program to know the status of the first concurrent program. These concurrent programs are invoked from the **Application Object Library** application. The **MS_SAMPLE_COPY_EMP_DATA** is created by running the script provided with the samples. For more information about samples, see [Samples for the Oracle EBS adapter](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/samples-for-the-oracle-ebs-adapter.md). A sample, **ConcurrentProgram_ServiceModel**, which is based on this topic, is also provided with the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] samples.  
  
## The WCF Client Class  
 The name of the WCF client generated for invoking the concurrent programs by the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] is listed in the following table.  
  
|Artifact|WCF Client Name|  
|--------------|---------------------|  
|Concurrent Program|ConcurrentPrograms_[APP_NAME]Client|  
  
 [APP_NAME] = Actual name of the Oracle E-Business Suite application; for example, FND.  
  
### Method Signature for Invoking Concurrent Programs  
 The following table shows the method signature for the concurrent programs.  
  
|Operation|Method Signature|  
|---------------|----------------------|  
|Concurrent program|public \<return type\> <Concurrent_program_name>(param 1, param 2, …)|  
  
 As an example, the following code shows the method signatures for a WCF client class generated for the **MS_SAMPLE_COPY_EMP_DATA** and **Get_Status** concurrent programs.  
  
```  
public partial class ConcurrentPrograms_FNDClient : System.ServiceModel.ClientBase<ConcurrentPrograms_FND>, ConcurrentPrograms_FND {      
  
    public string MS_SAMPLE_COPY_EMP_DATA(schemas.microsoft.com.OracleEBS._2008._05.Options.SetOptions SetOptions,  
      schemas.microsoft.com.OracleEBS._2008._05.Options.SetPrintOptions SetPrintOptions,  
      schemas.microsoft.com.OracleEBS._2008._05.Options.SetRepeatOptions SetRepeatOptions,  
      string Description, string StartTime);  
  
    public bool GetStatusForConcurrentProgram(string RequestId, out string Phase, out string Status,  
      out string DevPhase, out string DevStatus, out string Message);  
}  
```  
  
 In this snippet, **ConcurrentPrograms_FNDClient** is the name of the WCF class in the OracleEBSBindingClient.cs generated by the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)]. **MS_SAMPLE_COPY_EMP_DATA** is the name of the method to invoke the concurrent program. **GetStatusForConcurrentProgram** is the name of the method to invoke the concurrent program to get the status of the first concurrent program.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  **GetStatusForConcurrentProgram** is the actual name of the **Get_Status** concurrent program.  
  
## Creating a WCF Client to Invoke Concurrent Programs  
 The generic set of actions required to perform an operation on Oracle E-Business Suite using a WCF client involves a set of tasks described in [Overview of the WCF service model with the Oracle E-Business Suite adapter](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/overview-of-the-wcf-service-model-with-the-oracle-e-business-suite-adapter.md). This section describes how to create a WCF client to invoke the **MS_SAMPLE_COPY_EMP_DATA** and **Get_Status** concurrent programs.  
  
#### To create a WCF client  
  
1. Create a Visual C# project in Visual Studio. For this topic, create a console application.  
  
2. Generate the WCF client class for the **MS_SAMPLE_COPY_EMP_DATA** and **Get_Status** concurrent programs. For more information about generating a WCF client class, see [Generate a WCF client or a WCF service contract for Oracle E-Business Suite solution artifacts](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/create-a-wcf-client-or-wcf-service-contract-for-oracle-ebs-solution-artifacts.md).  
  
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   >  Before generating the WCF client class, make sure you set the **EnableBizTalkCompatibilityMode** binding property to false.  
  
3. In the Solution Explorer, add reference to `Microsoft.Adapters.OracleEBS` and `Microsoft.ServiceModel.Channels`.  
  
4. Open the Program.cs file and add the following namespaces:  
  
   -   `Microsoft.Adapters.OracleEBS`  
  
   -   `System.ServiceModel`  
  
5. Open the Program.cs file and create a client as described in the snippet below.  
  
   ```  
   OracleEBSBinding binding = new OracleEBSBinding();  
   EndpointAddress address = new EndpointAddress("oracleebs://ebs_instance_name");  
   ConcurrentPrograms_FNDClient client = new ConcurrentPrograms_FNDClient(binding, address);  
   ```  
  
    In this snippet, `ConcurrentPrograms_FNDClient` is the WCF client defined in OracleEBSBindingClient.cs. This file is generated by the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)].  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   >  In this snippet, you explicitly specify the binding and endpoint address in your application code. You can also use these values from the application configuration file, app.config, also generated by the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)]. For more information on the different ways of specifying client binding, see [Configure a client binding for the Oracle E-Business Suite](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/configure-a-client-binding-for-the-oracle-e-business-suite.md).  
  
6. Set the credentials for the client.  
  
   ```  
   client.ClientCredentials.UserName.UserName = "myuser";  
   client.ClientCredentials.UserName.Password = "mypassword";  
   ```  
  
7. Because you are invoking concurrent programs in an Oracle E-Business Suite application, you must set the application context. In this example, to set the application context, you specify the **OracleUserName**, **OraclePassword**, and **OracleEBSResponsibilityName** binding properties. For more information about application context, see [Set application context](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/set-application-context.md).  
  
   ```  
   binding.OracleUserName = "myOracleEBSUserName";  
   binding.OraclePassword = "myOracleEBSPassword";  
   binding.OracleEBSResponsibilityName = "myOracleEBSResponsibility";  
   ```  
  
8. Open the client as described in the snippet below:  
  
   ```  
   try  
   {  
      Console.WriteLine("Opening Client...");  
      client.Open();  
   }  
   catch (Exception ex)  
   {  
      Console.WriteLine("Exception: " + ex.Message);  
      throw;  
   }  
   ```  
  
9. Invoke the **MS_SAMPLE_COPY_EMP_DATA** and **Get_Status** concurrent programs.  
  
    ```  
    string RequestID;  
    bool Result;  
    string Phase;  
    string Status;  
    string DevPhase;  
    string DevStatus;  
    string Message;  
  
    try  
    {  
        Console.WriteLine("Invoking the MS_SAMPLE_COPY_EMP_DATA concurrent program");  
        RequestID = client.MS_SAMPLE_COPY_EMP_DATA(null, null, null, null, null);  
        Console.WriteLine("The request ID generated for the concurrent program is : " + RequestID);  
        Console.WriteLine("********************************************************");  
        Console.WriteLine("\nWaiting for 60 seconds for the concurrent program to be complete");  
        System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(60000);  
        Console.WriteLine("\nInvoking the Get_Status concurrent program");  
        Result = client.GetStatusForConcurrentProgram(RequestID, out Phase, out Status, out DevPhase, out DevStatus, out Message);  
        Console.WriteLine("\nResult is  : " + Result);  
        Console.WriteLine("Phase is     : " + Phase);  
        Console.WriteLine("Status is    : " + Status);  
        Console.WriteLine("DevPhase is  : " + DevPhase);  
        Console.WriteLine("DevStatus is : " + DevStatus);  
        Console.WriteLine("Message is   : " + Message);  
        Console.WriteLine("********************************************************");  
        Console.WriteLine("\nHit <RETURN> to end");  
        Console.ReadLine();  
    }  
    catch (Exception ex)  
    {  
        Console.WriteLine("Exception : " + ex);  
        throw;                 
    }  
    ```  
  
10. Close the client as described in the snippet below:  
  
    ```  
    client.Close();  
    ```  
  
11. Build the project and then run it. The application invokes the **MS_SAMPLE_COPY_EMP_DATA** and returns a request ID. The ID is then passed to the **Get_Status** concurrent program, which finally provides the status of the **MS_SAMPLE_COPY_EMP_DATA** column program.
