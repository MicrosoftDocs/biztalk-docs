# About business data catalog with Oracle E-Business Suite
The Business Data Catalog is a new integration component in Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 and later. The Business Data Catalog is a shared service and surfaces business data from backend applications via databases and Web services, without the need for writing any code. It is a metadata repository that defines business entities like customers, invoices, and purchase orders. Once defined, clients can use these entities.  
  
 The Business Data Catalog provides a Business Data Catalog Definition Editor to help you author application definition files for the Business Data Catalog in Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 and later. Using the Business Data Catalog Definition Editor, you can create and edit metadata for business applications.  
  
 For more information about the Business Data Catalog, see "Business Data Catalog" at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=103882](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=103882).
