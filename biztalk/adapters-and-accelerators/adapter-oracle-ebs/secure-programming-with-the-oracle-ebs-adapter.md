# Secure programming with the Oracle EBS adapter
## How Do I Protect Credentials When I Use the Add Adapter Service Reference Visual Studio Plug-in?
 When you use the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)] to create a WCF client, you must supply a user name and password for the Oracle E-Business Suite. You should only do this from the **Security** tab on the **Configure Adapter** dialog box. By entering the Oracle credentials from the **Security** tab instead of directly into the **Configure a URI** field, you ensure the following:

- The credentials will not be displayed in the **Configure a URI** field of the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)] dialog box where anyone with access to your computer screen can read them.

- The credentials will not appear in the configuration file that the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)] generates.

  For more information about how to generate a WCF client by using the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)], including how to enter a user name and password for the Oracle E-Business Suite, see [Get metadata for Oracle E-Business Suite operations in Visual Studio](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/get-metadata-for-oracle-e-business-suite-operations-in-visual-studio.md).

## What Are Best Practices for Setting Credentials in Code?
 [!INCLUDE[nextref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/nextref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] provides the **ClientCredentials** class to help you configure the credentials that a client communication object, such as a **ChannelFactory**, uses to authenticate itself with a service. By using the **ClientCredentials** class, you ensure that WCF takes whatever authentication mechanisms are specified in that objectâ€™s channel stack and applies them to the exchange between your client and the service.

 Because the [!INCLUDE[adapteroracleebusinesslong](../../includes/adapteroracleebusinesslong-md.md)] is hosted in-process with its consuming application, it is not imperative to use the **ClientCredentials** class to set credentials on the client communication objects that the consuming application uses. It is, however, considered good practice to do so.

 The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] encourages the use of the **ClientCredentials** class. This property specifies whether the adapter will accept the user name and password for the Oracle database in the connection URI. **AcceptCredentialsInUri** defaults to **false**, which means that the adapter will throw an exception if the connection URI contains credentials. You can set **AcceptCredentialsInUri** to **true** to supply credentials in the connection URI, if required in the client application.

 The following example shows how to use the **Credentials** property to set credentials for the Oracle E-Business Suite on a **ChannelFactory**.

```
// Create binding and endpoint
OracleEBSBinding binding = new OracleEBSBinding();
EndpointAddress address = new EndpointAddress("oracleebs://ebs-instance");

// Create the channel factory
ChannelFactory<IRequestChannel> factory = new ChannelFactory<IRequestChannel>(binding, address);

// Set user name and password
factory.Credentials.UserName.UserName = "myuser";
factory.Credentials.UserName.Password = "mypassword";

// Open the channel factory
factory.Open();
```

 The following example shows how to use the **ClientCredentials** class to set credentials for the Oracle E-Business Suite on a WCF client.

```
// Initialize a new client for the SQLEXECUTE operation from configuration
ConcurrentPrograms_ARClient client =
  new ConcurrentPrograms_ARClient("OracleEBSBinding_ConcurrentPrograms_AR");

// Set user name and password
client.ClientCredentials.UserName.UserName = "myuser";
client.ClientCredentials.UserName.Password = "mypassword";

// Open the client
client.Open();
```

## How Can I Provide for More Secure Data Exchange Across Process Boundaries?
 The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] is hosted in-process with the application or service that consumes it. Because the adapter is hosted in-process with the consumer, there is no need to provide security on messages exchanged between the consumer and the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)]. However, if the consuming application or service sends messages that contain sensitive database information across a process boundary to another service or client, you should take measures to provide adequate protection for this data in your environment. [!INCLUDE[firstref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/firstref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] provides many options for helping to secure messages sent between clients and services. For more information about helping to secure messages sent between clients and services in [!INCLUDE[nextref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/nextref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)], see "Securing Services and Clients" at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89725](/dotnet/framework/wcf/feature-details/securing-services-and-clients). For more general information about security features that [!INCLUDE[nextref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/nextref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] provides, see "Windows Communication Foundation Security" at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89726](/dotnet/framework/wcf/feature-details/security).
