# Limitations of BizTalk Adapter for Oracle E-Business Suite
## General Limitations  
 The following are known limitations for [!INCLUDE[adapteroracleebusinesslong](../../includes/adapteroracleebusinesslong-md.md)]:  
  
- The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] does not support XML Gateway, Advanced Queuing, and Business Events.  
  
   However, you can get around the Business Events limitation in the following way:  
  
  1. In Oracle Business Events System, create a subscription to invoke a custom PL/SQL procedure when a business event occurs.  
  
  2. Write a custom PL/SQL procedure that receives the business event.  
  
  3. Use the custom PL/SQL procedure to store the resultant data (event and event payload) in a table.  
  
  4. Use the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] to poll or receive notifications from the table.  
  
- The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] does not support XML Types.  
  
- The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] does not enable clients to set the value of the first element in a VARRAY to NULL.  
  
- The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] does not support records that contain fields of type PL/SQL tables of RECORD type.  
  
- The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] does not support User-Defined Types (UDTs) that have circular references.  
  
- The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] does not support the BFILE data type inside complex types (such as RECORD type, TABLE type, UDT, and VARRAY).  
  
- The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] supports UDT nesting only up to two levels.  
  
- Except for PL/SQL tables, the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] does not support UDTs that are defined inside a package.  
  
- When using the adapters with BizTalk Server, if the credentials on the WCF-custom send port are incorrect, the request messages are not processed. After you specify the correct credentials, the message is sent to Oracle E-Business Suite and a response is received. However, the response message is not available to the out port. In such scenarios, you may need to restart the host instance.  
  
## Limitations Due to ODP.NET  
 The following are known limitations for [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] due to the limitation of ODP.NET:  
  
- The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] does not support PL/SQL tables that are not indexed by a numeric field.  
  
- The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] does not support associative arrays that do not contain any element.  
  
- The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] does not support UDTs that contain the TimeStamp data type with local time zone attributes (TimeStampLTZ).  
  
- The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] does not support UDTs that contain a “.” (period) in their names.  
  
- The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] does not support UDTs that contain BLOB, CLOB, and NCLOB data types as an IN OUT parameter.  
  
- The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] does not support Varray of Varray of the following simple types: BFILE, IntervalDS, IntervalYM, TimeStampLTZ, and TimeStampTZ.  
  
- Due to the limitation of associative arrays, PL/SQL tables or PL/SQL tables of records that contain any of the following data types are not supported in the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)]:  
  
  -   BFILE  
  
  -   BLOB  
  
  -   CLOB  
  
  -   IntervalDS  
  
  -   IntervalYM  
  
  -   Long  
  
  -   NCLOB  
  
  -   RowID  
  
  -   TimeStamp  
  
  -   TimeStampLTZ  
  
  -   TimeStampTZ
