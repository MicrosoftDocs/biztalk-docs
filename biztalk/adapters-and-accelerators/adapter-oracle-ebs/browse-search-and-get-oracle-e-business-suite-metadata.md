# Browse, search, and get Oracle E-Business Suite metadata
The metadata that [!INCLUDE[adapteroracleebusinesslong](../../includes/adapteroracleebusinesslong-md.md)] surfaces from Oracle E-Business Suite and the underlying Oracle database describes the message structure for communicating with Oracle E-Business Suite using the adapter. The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] supports two interfaces for retrieving metadata.  
  
- MetadataExchange provided by [!INCLUDE[firstref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/firstref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)]. WCF provides a metadata-exchange endpoint for all WCF bindings, which enables clients to get metadata from Oracle E-Business Suite.  
  
- IMetadataRetrievalContract provided by the [!INCLUDE[afproductnamelong](../../includes/afproductnamelong-md.md)], which supports the metadata browsing and searching capabilities of the adapter.  
  
  The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] surfaces the Oracle E-Business Suite and the underlying database artifacts, and respective operations that the adapter clients can invoke. These operations are discussed later in this topic.  
  
  You can use the adapter clients to browse, search, and retrieve metadata by:  
  
- Creating a BizTalk project in Visual Studio  
  
- Using the WCF channel model  
  
- Using the WCF service model  
  
  When using a BizTalk project, you must use the [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservlong](../../includes/consumeadapterservlong-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[addadapterwiz](../../includes/addadapterwiz-md.md)] to generate metadata for the operations that you want to perform in Oracle E-Business Suite. When using the WCF service model, you must use the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservreflong](../../includes/addadapterservreflong-md.md)] to generate the proxy classes for performing operations in Oracle E-Business Suite. For more information about browsing, searching, and retrieving metadata using [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservshort](../../includes/consumeadapterservshort-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[addadapterwiz](../../includes/addadapterwiz-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)], see [Get Metadata for Oracle E-Business Suite Operations in Visual Studio](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/get-metadata-for-oracle-e-business-suite-operations-in-visual-studio.md).  
  
## Browsing metadata  
 The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] enables adapter clients to browse interface tables, interface views, concurrent programs, and request sets in Oracle E-Business Suite and tables, views, stored procedures, functions, and packages in the underlying database. As part of the metadata browse operation, the adapter also surfaces the operations that can be performed on the Oracle database, including some custom operations supported by the adapters. These operations are available from [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservshort](../../includes/consumeadapterservshort-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[addadapterwiz](../../includes/addadapterwiz-md.md)], and [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)].  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] surfaces most of the operations under the following three nodes:  
  
1. **Application-Based View**: Contains the operations grouped by each application for the Oracle E-Business Suite artifacts.  
  
2. **Artifact-Based View**: Contains the operations grouped by artifact type (such as Interface Tables, Interface Views, and so on) in Oracle E-Business Suite and the underlying database.  
  
3. **Schema-Based View**: Contains the operations grouped by each schema for the underlying database artifacts.  
  
   There are some generic operations exposed at the root level that are applicable for both the nodes. Moreover, different operations are surfaced based on the type of operation: outbound or inbound.  
  
   The following table lists the outbound and inbound operations surfaced by the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)]:

For information about these operations, see [Support for ExecuteNonQuery, ExecuteReader, and ExecuteScalar Operations](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/support-for-executenonquery-executereader-and-executescalar-operations.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                             The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] also exposes the Notification operation at the root level that enables adapter clients to receive database change notification messages from Oracle E-Business Suite. For more information about the notification operation, see [Considerations for Receiving Database Change Notifications](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-database/before-you-receive-database-change-notifications-using-the-oracle-db-adapter.md).                                                                                                             |
  
 For more information about how the metadata is categorized, see [Browse, Search, and Retrieve Metadata for Oracle E-Business Operations](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/browse-search-and-get-metadata-for-oracle-e-business-suite-operations.md).  
  
## Searching metadata  
 Using the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)], you can perform a search query in Oracle E-Business Suite and on the underlying Oracle database by using the Oracle search expressions that are compatible with the LIKE operator. For example, adapter clients can use a search expression such as “EMP%” to obtain tables starting with EMP. The adapter converts this to the following SQL query:  
  
```  
SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM ALL_TABLES WHERE TABLE_NAME LIKE 'EMP%' AND OWNER = 'SCOTT'  
```  
  
 Where, SCOTT is the schema with a collection of Oracle database artifacts.  
  
 The following table lists the special characters that can be used for search and their interpretation by the [!INCLUDE[adapteroracle_short](../../includes/adapteroracle-short-md.md)].  
  
|Special character|Interpretation|  
|-----------------------|--------------------|  
|_ (underscore)|Matches exactly one character<br /><br /> For example, A_ matches AB, AC, and AD.|  
|% (percentage)|Matches zero or more characters.<br /><br /> For example, A% matches A, AB, ABC.|  
|\ (escape)|Escapes the special meaning of % and _. The \ (escape) character is used before a wildcard character to indicate that the wildcard character should be interpreted as a regular character.<br /><br /> For example, A\\_B matches A_B.|  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> - The search string is case-sensitive.  
>   -   The search works differently under the different view (Application-Based View, Artifact-Based View, and Schema-Based View). To know how you can search for artifacts and operations under each view, see “Searching Under Different Views” in [Search for Oracle E-Business Suite operations](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/search-for-oracle-e-business-suite-operations.md).  
>   -   To search for an application you can specify the friendly name or the short name of the application. For example, to search for the **Receivables** application you can specify the search string as either **Receive%** or **AR**. AR is the application short name.  
>   -   To search for a concurrent program you can specify the friendly name or the actual name of the concurrent program. For example, to search for the **Customer Interface** concurrent program you can specify the search string as either **%Customer Interface%** or **%RACUST%**. RACUST is the actual name of the concurrent program. Also, the search result will always contain the standard concurrent programs irrespective of whether their name matches with the specified search string.  
  
## Retrieving metadata  
 When retrieving metadata, the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] can extract metadata under a schema, including all or a subset of database objects with the respective object and operation parameters. The adapter presents the entities from Oracle E-Business Suite and the underlying Oracle database as element names in XML. Because underscores are the only permissible special characters that can be included, all other special characters in the element names are encoded using underscores. For example, `emp$name` is encoded as `emp_x0024_name`. For more information, see [Get Metadata for SQL Server operations in Visual Studio using the SQL adapter](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sql/get-metadata-for-sql-server-operations-in-visual-studio-using-the-sql-adapter.md).
