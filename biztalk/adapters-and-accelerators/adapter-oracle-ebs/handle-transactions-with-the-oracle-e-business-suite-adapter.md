# Handle transactions with the Oracle E-Business Suite adapter
[!INCLUDE[adapteroracleebusinesslong](../../includes/adapteroracleebusinesslong-md.md)] does not initiate a transaction while performing an operation in Oracle E-Business Suite. Instead, the adapter performs the operations using the transaction context provided by the adapter clients. In order to perform operations in a transaction using the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)], you must:  
  
-   Enable transactions in the adapter clients. For example, to enable transactions in BizTalk Server, you must select the **Use Transaction** check box in the **Transactions** area of the **Messages** tab for a WCF-Custom or WCF-OracleEBS port.  
  
-   Set the value of the **UseAmbientTransaction** binding property to **True** in the adapter. For more information about the binding property, see [Read about the BizTalk Adapter for Oracle E-Business Suite Binding Properties](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/read-about-the-biztalk-adapter-for-oracle-e-business-suite-binding-properties.md).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  To use the adapter to perform transactions in Oracle E-Business Suite, you must have installed the **Oracle Services For Microsoft Transaction Server** component, while installing the Oracle client, on the computer running the adapter client.  
  
## Transactions in the Outbound Operations  
 The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] performs an outbound operation in a single transaction. For composite operations, all the operations are performed in a single transaction but using different ODP.NET connections. For more information about the outbound operations surfaced by the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)], see [How Does the Adapter Surface Oracle E-Business Suite Metadata?](./browse-search-and-get-oracle-e-business-suite-metadata.md).  
  
## Transactions in the Inbound Operations  
 The [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)] exposes the following two inbound operations:  
  
- **Polling**: The polling statement and the post-poll statement (if specified) are executed in a transaction, whereas, the polled data available statement is executed in a different transaction. Similarly, the polling statement and the post-poll statement are executed using the same ODP.NET connection, whereas, the polled data available statement is executed using a different ODP.NET connection.  
  
- **Notification**: The notification operation is performed in a transaction using a single ODP.NET connection.  
  
  For more information about the inbound operations surfaced by the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)], see [How Does the Adapter Surface Oracle E-Business Suite Metadata?](./browse-search-and-get-oracle-e-business-suite-metadata.md).
