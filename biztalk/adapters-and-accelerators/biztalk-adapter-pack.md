# BizTalk Adapter Pack

## Overview

 The Microsoft [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)] includes adapters that enable enterprise applications and databases to interface with each other by using a common adapter framework. Similar to programming to web services, adapters enable clients to program to different enterprise applications. Technically, adapters are a binding to Windows Communication Framework (WCF). The [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)] includes the following adapters:  

- [!INCLUDE[adapteroracle](../includes/adapteroracle-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[adapteroracle_short](../includes/adapteroracle-short-md.md)])  

- [!INCLUDE[adapteroracleebusinesslong](../includes/adapteroracleebusinesslong-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)])  

- [!INCLUDE[adaptersap](../includes/adaptersap-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)]). This also includes the [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersaplong](../includes/adoprovidersaplong-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[adoprovidersapshort](../includes/adoprovidersapshort-md.md)])  

- [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel](../includes/adaptersiebel-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)]). This also includes the [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersiebellong](../includes/adoprovidersiebellong-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[adoprovidersiebelshort](../includes/adoprovidersiebelshort-md.md)])  

- [!INCLUDE[adaptersql](../includes/adaptersql-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)]).  

Using these adapters, you can connect to these on-premises line-of-business (LOB) systems to get data, and put data. The [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)] is included with [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion_md](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], and can be used or consumed from:

* [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion_md](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)]
* A .NET application
* An ADO interface
* A Microsoft SharePoint portal
