# Browse, search, and get metadata for tRFC operations in SAP
tRFCs are not a separate artifact in an SAP system. These are categorized under a separate node by the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] because their metadata characteristics are different from that of RFCs. However, the experience of browsing, searching, and retrieving metadata for tRFCs is identical to that of the RFCs. Refer to [Browse, search, and get metadata for RFC operations in SAP](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/browse-search-and-get-metadata-for-rfc-operations-in-sap.md) for information about using the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservshort](../../includes/consumeadapterservshort-md.md)] to browse, search, and retrieve metadata for tRFCs from an SAP system.  
  
 Note that the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] surfaces a special operation **RfcConfirmTransID** under the **TRFC** node. The SAP adapter uses this operation to commit tRFC calls made to the SAP server. For more information about this operation, see [Operations on tRFCs in SAP](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/operations-on-trfcs-in-sap.md).
