# About Business Data Catalog with the SAP adapter
The Business Data Catalog is a new integration component in Microsoft SharePoint. The Business Data Catalog is a shared service and surfaces business data from backend applications via databases and Web services, without the need for writing any code. It is a metadata repository that defines business entities like customers, invoices, and purchase orders. Once defined, clients can use these entities.  
  
 The Business Data Catalog provides a Business Data Catalog Definition Editor to help you author application definition files for the Business Data Catalog in SharePoint. Using the Business Data Catalog Definition Editor, you can create and edit metadata for business applications.
