# Use the Data Provider for SAP with SSRS
You can use the [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersaplong](../../includes/adoprovidersaplong-md.md)] along with SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) to create reports based on SAP data. For more information about SSRS, see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=125922](/sql/reporting-services/create-deploy-and-manage-mobile-and-paginated-reports).

 To create reports based on SAP data, you must use [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] to create a Report Server project and use the [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersapshort](../../includes/adoprovidersapshort-md.md)] to extract data from an SAP system.

 The topics in this section provide information about how to create a Report Server project to generate reports based on SAP data.
