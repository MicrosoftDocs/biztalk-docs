# Step 3: Test the Migrated Application
![Step 3 of 3](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-database/media/step-3of3.gif "Step_3of3")  
  
 **Time to complete:** 5 minutes  
  
 **Objective:** In this step, you will test the migrated application by invoking the SD_RFC_CUSTOMER_GET RFC. To do this, you drop a request message that conforms to the schema generated using the vPrev SAP adapter.  
  
## Prerequisites  
  
- Configure the BizTalk application by mapping the logical ports in the BizTalk orchestration to physical ports in the BizTalk Server Administration console.  
  
- Configure the BizTalk application to use the WCF-Custom send port for the WCF-based [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)].  
  
### To test the migrated application  
  
1. From the SAP_RFC_Migration folder, copy the Input.xml request message. This request message conforms to the schema generated by the vPrev SAP adapter. Using the outbound map, the WCF-Custom send port converts this to conform to the schema for the WCF-based [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] and sends it to the SAP system.  
  
   ```  
   <ns0:SD_RFC_CUSTOMER_GET_Request xmlns:ns0="http://schemas.microsoft.com/BizTalk/2003">  
     <KUNNR>0000001390</KUNNR>  
     <NAME1/>  
     <CUSTOMER_T/>  
   </ns0:SD_RFC_CUSTOMER_GET_Request>  
   ```  
  
2. Paste the request message to the folder that is mapped to the file receive location.  
  
3. The orchestration consumes the request message and sends it to the SAP system. The response from the SAP system is received in the schema that conforms with the schema of the WCF-based [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)]. Using the inbound map, the WCF-Custom send port converts this to the schema for the vPrev SAP adapter. The response from the SAP system is saved to the other file location defined as part of the orchestration. The response for the previous request message is:  
  
   ```  
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>   
   <ns0:SD_RFC_CUSTOMER_GET_Response xmlns:ns0="http://schemas.microsoft.com/BizTalk/2003">  
     <CUSTOMER_T>  
       <KUNNR>0000001390</KUNNR>   
       <ANRED>Firma</ANRED>   
       <NAME1>Contoso, Ltd.</NAME1>   
       <PFACH />

       <PSTLZ>50000</PSTLZ>   
       <ORT01>Aachen</ORT01>   
       <TELF1>0123-45678</TELF1>   
       <TELFX>0123-56789</TELFX>   
     </CUSTOMER_T>  
   </ns0:SD_RFC_CUSTOMER_GET_Response>  
   ```
