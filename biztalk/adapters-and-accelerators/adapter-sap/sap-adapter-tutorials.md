# SAP Adapter Tutorials
## Overview
The first of the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] tutorials contains a step-by-step demonstration of how to present data from an SAP system on a Microsoft SharePoint portal. The remainder of the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] tutorials contains detailed instructions on how to migrate BizTalk projects that were created using the previous version of the SAP adapter to the current WCF-based [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)].  
  
 In addition to the tutorials, the topics in the [Develop BizTalk applications](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/develop-biztalk-applications-using-the-sap-adapter.md) section provide detailed instructions on how to use the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)].
