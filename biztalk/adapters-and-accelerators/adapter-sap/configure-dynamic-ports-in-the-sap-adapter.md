# Configure dynamic ports in the SAP adapter
## Use message context properties
In [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], you can configure dynamic ports for a [!INCLUDE[wcfadapter_short](../../includes/wcfadapter-short-md.md)]. Because [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] is a WCF-based adapter, you can dynamically configure a port for the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] by using message context properties.  
  
 For the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)], the URI, action, and binding might be determined from a property on an incoming message, and then specified in the Expression shape, as shown in the following example:  
  
```  
Request2=Request1;  
Request2(WCF.Action)="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Rfc/RFC_CUSTOMER_GET";  
Request2(WCF.BindingType)="sapBinding";  
Request2(WCF.UserName)="YourUserName";  
Request2(WCF.Password)="YourPassword";  
SendPort(Microsoft.XLANGs.BaseTypes.Address)="sap://CLIENT=800;LANG=EN;@A/YourSAPHost/00";  
SendPort(Microsoft.XLANGs.BaseTypes.TransportType)="WCF-Custom";  
  
```  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If you are using a WCF-SAP adapter in [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console, you can also specify the transport type as `SendPort(Microsoft.XLANGs.BaseTypes.TransportType)="SAPAdapter"`, where **SAPAdapter** is the name with which you added the WCF-SAP adapter in [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console.  
  
 In the preceding example:  
  
- Request2 message is being created from Request1 message. Both the messages map to an operation schema, which is generated using the [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservlong](../../includes/consumeadapterservlong-md.md)].  
  
- SendPort is the name of the logical send port in the BizTalk orchestration.  
  
  The Expression shape is part of the BizTalk orchestration. When you deploy the orchestration, the WCF-Custom send port is also created.
