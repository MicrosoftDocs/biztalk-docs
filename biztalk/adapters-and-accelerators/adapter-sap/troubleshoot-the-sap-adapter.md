# Troubleshoot the SAP adapter
The [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)] uses or depends on several Microsoft technologies, including but not limited to the [!INCLUDE[afproductnamelong](../../includes/afproductnamelong-md.md)], Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)], and the Microsoft [!INCLUDE[dotnet45](../../includes/dotnet45-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[dotnet451](../../includes/dotnet451-md.md)]. The [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)] is built on top of the [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)], which in turn requires the [!INCLUDE[dotnet45](../../includes/dotnet45-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[dotnet451](../../includes/dotnet451-md.md)]. The adapters can be consumed either by writing applications using [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] or by creating BizTalk applications. For issues related to each of these technologies and products, see the respective documentation.  
  
 This section provides information about troubleshooting the [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)], including:  
  
-   Enabling tracing to diagnose issues with the adapters.  
  
-   Handling installation and operational issues that you might encounter when working with the adapters, including probable cause, and a resolution.  
  
-   Using performance counters to gauge adapter performance.  
  
-   Handling exceptions and errors, including probable cause, and a resolution.
