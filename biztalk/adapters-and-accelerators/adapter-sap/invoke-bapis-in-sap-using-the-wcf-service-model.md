# Invoke BAPIs in SAP using the WCF Service Model
The [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] surfaces BAPIs as:  
  
- **RFC operations**. BAPIs like any other RFC are surfaced under the RFC node in the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)].  
  
- **Methods of SAP business objects**. As methods of business objects, BAPIs are surfaced by business object under the BAPI node in the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)].  
  
  Whether you invoke a BAPI as an RFC operation or as a business object method, each BAPI is always part of an LUW on the SAP system.  
  
  For an overview of how the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] supports BAPIs, see [Operations on BAPIs in SAP](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/operations-on-bapis-in-sap.md).  
  
  When you use the WCF service model to invoke BAPIs as business object methods, each SAP business object is represented by a WCF client class and the BAPIs of that business object are represented as methods on the client. You can use the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservreflong](../../includes/addadapterservreflong-md.md)] to generate a WCF client class for specific business objects that contains methods for each BAPI that you want to invoke in your code. The [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)] also generates .NET types to encapsulate the parameters and data types that are used by each BAPI. You can then create an instance of this WCF client class and call its methods to invoke the target BAPIs.  
  
  The following sections show you how to invoke BAPIs as methods of business objects and discuss how BAPI transactions are supported in the WCF service model.  
  
## The WCF Client Class  
 The [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] surfaces a different service contract, for each business object. This means that for each business object a unique WCF client class is created. The name of this class is based on the business object type. For example for the Sales Order business object (business object type BUS2032), the WCF client class is **BapiBUS2032Client**. Each target BAPI in the business object is represented as a method in the generated WCF client class. In each method:  
  
- SAP export parameters are surfaced as **out** parameters  
  
- SAP calling parameters are surfaced as **ref** parameters.  
  
- Complex SAP types such as structures are surfaced as .NET classes with properties that correspond to the fields of the SAP type. These classes are defined in the following namespace: microsoft.lobservices.sap._2007._03.Types.Rfc.  
  
  BAPI_TRANSACTION_COMMIT and BAPI_TRANSACTION_ROLLBACK are surfaced for each business object and you should always include these in your WCF client.  
  
  The following code shows part of a WCF client class generated for the Sales Order business object. This client contains methods to invoke CREATEFROMDAT2, BAPI_TRANSACTION_COMMIT and BAPI_TRANSACTION_ROLLBACK. For clarity the constructors and other code has been omitted.

## BAPI Transactions in the WCF Service Model  
 Every BAPI, whether it is invoked as an RFC or as a business object method, is part of a transaction (LUW) on the SAP system; and every BAPI received over the same SAP connection is part of the same BAPI transaction on the SAP system. SAP commits or rolls back the BAPI transaction when it receives a BAPI_TRANSACTION_COMMIT or a BAPI_TRANSACTION_ROLLBACK on the connection. After a commit or rollback has been performed, the next BAPI received over the connection begins a new transaction.  
  
 For the adapter each WCF channel has a dedicated SAP connection. In the WCF service model, each WCF client has an inner channel that is used send messages to the SAP system. This means that the BAPIs that are invoked using a specific WCF client are part of a unique BAPI transaction on the SAP system. This imposes a significant limitation when you use the WCF service model to invoke BAPIs as business object methods. Because each SAP business object is represented by a dedicated WCF client class, you cannot invoke BAPIs from two different business objects as part of the same transaction. The way around this is to invoke the BAPIs as RFC operations. This is because the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)] generates a single WCF client for RFC operations, and, therefore, all operations invoked using that client are sent over the same WCF channel.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  If you want to include BAPIs from different SAP business objects in the same BAPI transaction, you must invoke them as RFC operations (using the same WCF client). You cannot invoke them as business object methods.  
  
 You call BAPI_TRANSACTION_COMMIT or BAPI_TRANSACTION_ROLLBACK to commit or roll back the BAPI transaction on the SAP system. The adapter surfaces these two BAPIs:  
  
- Under the Basis node as RFC operations.  
  
- Under each business object.  
  
  For more information about how the adapter supports BAPI transactions on SAP, see [Operations on BAPIs in SAP](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/operations-on-bapis-in-sap.md).  
  
## How to Create an Application that Invokes BAPIs as Methods of Business Objects  
 This section provides information about how to invoke BAPIs as methods of business objects. The same basic procedure should be followed to invoke BAPIs as RFC operations, except that you create a WCF client that targets the BAPIs as RFC operations and use it to invoke each BAPI.  
  
 To create a BAPI client application, perform the following steps.  
  
#### To create an BAPI client application  
  
1. Generate a WCF client class. Use the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservreflong](../../includes/addadapterservreflong-md.md)] or the ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (svcutil.exe) to generate a WCF client class (or classes) that targets the business objects and BAPIs with which you want to work. Be sure to include the BAPI_TRANSACTION_COMMIT and the BAPI_TRANSACTION_ROLLBACK methods (BAPIs) exposed for each target business object. For more information about how to generate a WCF client, see [Generating a WCF Client or a WCF Service Contract for SAP Solution Artifacts](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/generate-a-wcf-client-or-a-wcf-service-contract-for-sap-solution-artifacts.md).  
  
2. Create an instance of the WCF client class generated in step 1, and create and configure a WCF client. Configuring the WCF client involves specifying the binding and endpoint address that the client will use. You can do this either imperatively in code or declaratively in configuration. For more information about how to specify a client binding, see [Configure a Client Binding for the SAP System](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/configure-a-client-binding-for-the-sap-system.md). The following code initializes the WCF client for the Sales Order (BUS2032) SAP business object from configuration and sets the credentials for the SAP system.  
  
   ```  
   BapiBUS2032Client bapiClient = new BapiBUS2032Client("SAPBinding_BapiBUS2032");  
  
   bapiClient.ClientCredentials.UserName.UserName = "YourUserName";  
   bapiClient.ClientCredentials.UserName.Password = "YourPassword";  
   ```  
  
3. Open the WCF client.  
  
   ```  
   bapiClient.Open();  
   ```  
  
4. Invoke methods on the WCF client created in step 2 to invoke the appropriate BAPIs on the SAP system. You can invoke multiple BAPIs on the SAP system.  
  
5. End the transaction by:  
  
   1.  Invoking the BAPI_TRANSACTION_COMMIT method to commit the transaction.  
  
       ```  
       bapiClient.BAPI_TRANSACTION_COMMIT("X");  
       ```  
  
   2.  Invoking the BAPI_TRANSACTION_ROLLBACK method to roll back the transaction.  
  
       ```  
       bapiClient.BAPI_TRANSACTION_ROLLBACK();  
       ```  
  
6. Close the WCF client.  
  
   ```  
   bapiClient.Close();   
   ```  
  
### Example  
 The following example invokes the CREATEFROMDAT2 BAPI on the Sales Order business object. It invokes the BAPI several times and then invokes BAPI_TRANSACTION_COMMIT to commit the transaction. If an error occurs when invoking the BAPI, BAPI_TRANSACTION_ROLLBACK is invoked in the exception handler to roll back the transaction.  
  
 The CREATEFROMDAT2 method takes many parameters; these are omitted in the example for the sake of brevity. You can find a sample that demonstrates BAPI transactions in the samples shipped with the Microsoft [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)]. For more information, see [Samples for the SAP Adapter](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/samples-for-the-sap-adapter.md).
