# Metadata and the WCF Service Model with SAP
In the WCF service model, you use the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservreflong](../../includes/addadapterservreflong-md.md)].or the ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (svcutile.exe) to generate proxy classes through which your code can either:  
  
- Invoke operations on the adapter (a WCF client class)  
  
- Receive operations from the adapter (a WCF service contract)  
  
  These tools generate .NET classes that represent a service contract for target operations (as well as the supporting message contracts, operation contracts, and data contracts) from the metadata exposed by the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap](../../includes/adaptersap-md.md)]. For help in understanding the structure of this generated code, see [Understanding Generated Client Code](/dotnet/framework/wcf/feature-details/understanding-generated-client-code). This topic specifically describes code that svcutil.exe generates, but its content is also applicable to the code that the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)] generates. For information about how to generate a WCF client class or WCF service contract (interface) for target operations and about the differences between svcutil.exe and the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)], see [Generate a WCF client or a WCF service contract for SAP solution artifacts](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/generate-a-wcf-client-or-a-wcf-service-contract-for-sap-solution-artifacts.md).
