# Support for Message Versioning

The [!INCLUDE[adaptersap](../../includes/adaptersap-md.md)] supports versioning by including a version string component in the message actions, namespaces, and node IDs surfaced for operations. The current version is `http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03`. This means that for an RFC named "RFC_SAMPLE", the RFC operation surfaced by the adapter has the following:  
  
- Node ID: `http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Rfc/RFC_SAMPLE`  
  
- Message action: `http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Rfc/RFC_SAMPLE`  
  
- Namespace: `http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Rfc`  
  
> [!NOTE]
> This feature does not provide backward compatibility with the earlier versions of the adapter.
