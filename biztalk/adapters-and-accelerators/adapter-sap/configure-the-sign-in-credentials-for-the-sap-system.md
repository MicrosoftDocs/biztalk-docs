# Configure the sign in credentials for the SAP system
The [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] requires the adapter clients to provide client credentials. The adapter uses these credentials to authenticate the user with the SAP system and to establish a connection.  

 Adapter clients can provide the client credentials both at design time or run time. At design time, credentials are required to generate the metadata. At run time, credentials are required to perform operations on the SAP system. This section provides information about specifying client credentials at design time and run time.  

## Enter the client credentials at design time  
 For design time, you can specify the credentials using the [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservshort](../../includes/consumeadapterservshort-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[addadapterwiz](../../includes/addadapterwiz-md.md)].  

### Enter credentials using Consume Adapter Service Add-in  

1.  Right-click your BizTalk project, point to **Add**, and then click **Add Generated Items**.  

2.  In the **Add Generated Items** dialog box, do the following:  

    |Use this|To do this|  
    |--------------|----------------|  
    |**Categories**|Click **Consume Adapter Service**.|  
    |**Templates**|Click **Consume Adapter Service**.|  

3.  To start the **Consume Adapter Service** dialog box, click **Add**.  

4.  In the **Consume Adapter Service** dialog box, from the **Select a binding** list, select **sapBinding**, and then click **Configure**.  

5.  In the **Configure Adapter** dialog box, click the **Security** tab and from the **Client credential type** drop-down list box, select **Username** and specify the user name and password to connect to the SAP system.  

6.  Click **OK**.  

### Enter credentials using Add Adapter Metadata Wizard  

1. Right-click your BizTalk project, point to **Add**, and then click **Add Generated Items**.  

2. In the **Add Generated Items** dialog box, do the following:  


   |    Use this    |           To do this            |
   |----------------|---------------------------------|
   | **Categories** |     Click **Add Adapter**.      |
   | **Templates**  | Click **Add Adapter Metadata**. |


3. Click **Add**. The [!INCLUDE[addadapterwiz](../../includes/addadapterwiz-md.md)] opens.  

4. In the Add Adapter Wizard, select **WCF-SAP**. Select the computer on which BizTalk Server is installed and the name of the BizTalk database.  

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   >  If you already have a WCF-SAP port configured in BizTalk, select the port from the **Port** list.  

5. Click **Next**.  

6. In the **Consume Adapter Service** dialog box, from the **Select a binding** list, select **sapBinding**, and then click **Configure**.  

7. In the **Configure Adapter** dialog box, click the **Security** tab and from the **Client credential type** drop-down list box, select **Username** and specify the user name and password to connect to the SAP system.  

8. Click **OK**.  

## Enter client credentials at run time  
 For run time, you can specify the client credentials as part of the WCF-Custom or WCF-SAP port configuration in the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console.  

### Enter credentials for the WCF-Custom port  

1. Start the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console.  

2. In the console tree, expand **BizTalk Group**, then expand **Applications**, and then expand the application under which you want to create a port, and click **Send Ports** or **Receive Ports**. In the right pane, you can choose to create a port or select an existing port.  

3. In the port properties dialog box, from the **Type** drop-down list, select **WCF-Custom**, and then click **Configure**.  

   > [!NOTE]
   >  To see the location properties dialog box for a receive port, click the **Receive Location** tab on the left pane of the port properties dialog box, and then click **New**.  

4. For a send port, in the **WCF-Custom Transport Properties** dialog box, click the **Credentials** tab and do one of the following:  

   -   Select the **Do not use Single Sign-On** option, and specify the user name and password to connect to an SAP system.  

   -   Select the **Use Single Sign-On** option, and specify an affiliate Enterprise Single Sign-on (SSO) application.  

5. For a receive port, in the **WCF-Custom Transport Properties** dialog box, click the **Other** tab and do one of the following:  

   -   Select **User account** option, and specify the user name and password to connect to an SAP system.  

   -   Select **Get credentials from affiliate application** option, and specify an affiliate application.  

6. Click **OK**.  

### Enter credentials for the WCF-SAP port  

1. Start the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console.  

2. Add the WCF-SAP adapter to the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console. For instructions, see [Add the SAP Adapter to BizTalk Server Administration Console](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/add-the-sap-adapter-to-biztalk-server-administration-console.md).  

3. In the console tree, expand **BizTalk Group**, then expand **Applications**, and then expand the application under which you want to create a port, and click **Send Ports** or **Receive Ports**. In the right pane, you can choose to create a port or select an existing port.  

4. In the port properties dialog box, from the **Type** drop-down list, select the WCF-SAP adapter you added earlier, and then click **Configure**.  

   > [!NOTE]
   >  To see the location properties dialog box for a receive port, click the **Receive Location** tab on the left pane of the port properties dialog box, and then click **New**.  

5. If you are creating a send port, in the transport properties dialog box, click the **Credentials** tab and do one of the following:  

   1.  Select the **Do not use Single Sign-On** option, and specify the user name and password to connect to the SAP system.  

   2.  Select the **Use Single Sign-On** option, and specify an affiliate Enterprise Single Sign-on (SSO) application.  

6. If you are creating a receive port, in the **WCF-Custom Transport Properties** dialog box, click the **Other** tab and do one of the following:  

   1.  Select **User account** option, and specify the user name and password to connect to the SAP system.  

   2.  Select **Get credentials from affiliate application** option, and specify an affiliate SSO application.  

7. Click **OK**.  

> [!NOTE]
>  [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)] also supports the Enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) system. SSO is only applicable in the BizTalk scenario, in which the [!INCLUDE[wcfadapter_short](../../includes/wcfadapter-short-md.md)] is aware of SSO affiliate applications. For more information about security with respect to BizTalk Server, see [Security with the SAP adapter and BizTalk Server](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/security-with-the-sap-adapter-and-biztalk-server.md).
