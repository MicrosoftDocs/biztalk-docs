# Receive Inbound Operations from the SAP System Using the WCF Channel Model
To act as an RFC server and receive operations invoked by the SAP system (such as sending an IDOC or invoking an RFC), you must create a channel listener that can listen for messages from a SAP Program ID over a **System.ServiceModel.Channels.IReplyChannel** channel shape.  
  
 A channel listener (**System.ServiceModel.Channels.IChannelListener**) is a WCF communication object that can be used to receive messages from specific WCF endpoints. The channel listener functions as a factory from which you can create channels over which messages invoked by a client (the SAP system) can be received by your service. You create a channel listener by from a **Microsoft.Adapters.SAP.SAPBinding** object by invoking the **BuildChannelListener** method. You supply an SAP connection URI that specifies the SAP Program ID from which inbound operations will be received to this method.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] supports the **IReplyChannel** channel shape. **IReplyChannel** channels support an inbound request-response message exchange pattern. That is, a pattern in which an external program sends a request message over the channel and your program returns a response.  
  
 For an overview of how to receive operations using an **IReplyChannel** in WCF, see [Service Channel-Level Programming](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms789029.aspx).
  
 This section covers the following topics that are specific to receiving operations from a SAP system:  
  
-   How to filter for specific operations using the channel listener.  
  
-   How to raise an exception on the SAP system.  
  
-   Streaming inbound flat-file IDOCs from the SAP adapter.  
  
-   How to receive operations from the SAP system.  
  
## How Do I Filter Operations Using the Channel Listener?  
  
### Using an InboundActionCollection to Filter Operations  
 The [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)] provides the **Microsoft.ServiceModel.Channels.InboundActionCollection** class to enable you to filter operations that are received by a channel listener and passed to your application code. To filter for specific operations, you create an instance of this class by using the listener endpoint URI. Then you add the (request) message action for each target operation to the collection. Finally, you add the inbound action collection to a **System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingParameterCollection** object and then pass this binding parameter collection into the call to create the channel listener.  
  
 If the SAP system invokes an operation that is not in the inbound action collection:  
  
-   The [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] returns an EXCEPTION exception to the caller on the SAP system with the following message: "The incoming RFC call [RFC_NAME] on the Rfc Server is not handled". In this message, [RFC_NAME] is the name of the RFC (for example, IDOC_INBOUND_ASYNCHRONOUS).  
  
-   The adapter throws a **Microsoft.ServiceModel.Channels.Common.AdapterException** with a message that indicates the operation that was received. For an example of how to use this exception, see the example at the end of this topic.  
  
 The following code example shows how to use an **InboundActionCollection** to create a channel listener that filters for a single RFC, Z_RFC_MKD_DIV.  
  
```  
// The connection Uri must specify listener parameters (or an R-type destination in saprfc.ini)  
// and credentials.  
Uri listeneraddress =  
    new Uri("sap://User=YourUserName;Passwd=YourPassword;Client=800;Lang=EN;@a/YourSAPHost/00?ListenerGwServ=SAPGATEWAY&ListenerGwHost=YourSAPHost&ListenerProgramId=SAPAdapter");  
  
// Create a binding and set AcceptCredentialsInUri to true  
SAPBinding binding = new SAPBinding();  
binding.AcceptCredentialsInUri = true;  
  
// Create an InboundActionCollection and add the message actions to listen for,  
// only the actions added to the InboundActionCollection are received on the channel.  
// In this case a single action is specified: http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Rfc/Z_RFC_MKD_DIV  
InboundActionCollection actions = new InboundActionCollection(listeneraddress);  
actions.Add("http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Rfc/Z_RFC_MKD_DIV");  
  
// Create a BindingParameterCollection and add the InboundActionCollection  
BindingParameterCollection bpcol = new BindingParameterCollection();  
bpcol.Add(actions);  
  
// Create the channel listener by specifying the binding parameter collection (to filter for the Z_RFC_MKD_DIV action)  
listener = binding.BuildChannelListener<IReplyChannel>(listeneraddress, bpcol);  
```  
  
### Manually Filtering Operations  
 If you do not specify an inbound action collection for the channel listener, then all operations invoked by the SAP system will be passed to your code. You can manually filter such operations by checking the message action of inbound requests.  
  
 There may also be scenarios in which you want to filter an operation based on its content. For example if you are receiving IDOCs in:  
  
-   String format (the **ReceiveIDocFormat** binding property is **String**); all IDOCs are received using the ReceiveIdoc operation.  
  
-   Rfc format (the **ReceiveIDocFormat** binding property is **Rfc**); all IDOCs are received using either the IDOC_INBOUND_ASYNCHRONOUS RFC or the INBOUND_IDOC_PROCESS RFC.  
  
 In this scenario you may want to implement filtering based on specific IDOC parameters (such as the IDOC type) in your code.  
  
 When you filter operations manually, you can return a fault to the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] for operations that you don't handle. This will raise the EXCEPTION exception to the caller on the SAP System. You can also return an empty response if you don't want to raise an exception on SAP.  
  
 The following code shows how to filter manually for the Z_RFC_MKD_DIV operation.  
  
```  
// Get the message from the channel  
RequestContext rc = channel.ReceiveRequest();  
Message reqMessage = rc.RequestMessage;  
  
// Filter based on the message action.  
if (reqMessage.Headers.Action == "http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Rfc/Z_RFC_MKD_DIV")  
{  
  
    // Process message and return response.  
    ...  
  
}  
else  
{  
    // If this isn't the correct message return an empty response or a fault message.  
    // This example returns an empty response.  
    rc.Reply(Message.CreateMessage(MessageVersion.Default, reqMessage.Headers.Action + "/response"));  
}  
```  
  
## How Do I Raise an Exception on the SAP System?  
 To indicate an error to the caller on the SAP system you can reply to a request message with a SOAP fault. When you return a SOAP fault to the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)], the adapter returns an EXCEPTION exception to the caller on the SAP system. The exception message is created from the elements of the SOAP fault.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] creates the message for the SAP EXCEPTION according to the following order of precedence:  
  
1.  If the SOAP fault contains a detail object, the adapter serializes the detail to a string and the exception message is set to this string.  
  
2.  If the SOAP fault contains a reason, the exception message is set to its value.  
  
3.  Otherwise, the adapter serializes the **MessageFault** object itself to a string and the exception message is set to this string.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The adapter only uses the fault message to create the exception message returned in the exception raised on the SAP system; therefore, the values that you set for these entities is completely up to you.  
  
 WCF provides the **System.ServiceModel.Channels.MessageFault** class to encapsulate an in-memory representation of a SOAP fault. You can use any of the static, overloaded **MessageFault.CreateFault** methods to create a new SOAP fault from which you can then create a fault message by invoking the appropriate **Message.CreateMessage** overload. WCF also provides overloads of **CreateMessage** that create a fault message without using a **MessageFault** object.  
  
 You use the **System.ServiceModel.Channels.RequestContext.Reply** method to return the fault message to the adapter. The [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] ignores the message action for fault messages, so you can set the message action to any value.  
  
 The following example shows how to return a fault message to the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)]. This example omits the steps to create the channel listener and channel.  
  
```  
RequestContext rc = channel.ReceiveRequest();  
…  
// Start processing the inbound message  
…  
// If an error is encountered return a fault to the SAP system  
// This example uses CreateMessage overload to create a fault message.  
// The overload takes a SOAP version, fault code, reason, and message action  
// The SAP adapter ignores the message action for a fault so you can set it to any value you want.   
Message faultMessage = Message.CreateMessage(MessageVersion.Default, new FaultCode("SAP Example Fault"), "Testing SAP Faults", rc.RequestMessage.Headers.Action + "/fault");  
  
rc.Reply(faultMessage);  
```  
  
## Streaming Inbound Flat-File IDOCs from the SAP Adapter  
 You receive flat-file (string) IDOCs from the adapter in the inbound ReceiveIdoc operation. The IDOC data is represented as a string under a single node in this operation. For this reason, the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] supports node-value streaming on the request message. To perform node-value streaming, you must consume the request message for the ReceiveIdoc operation by invoking the **Message.WriteBodyContents** method with a **System.Xml.XmlDictionaryWriter** that is capable of streaming the IDOC data. For information about how to do this, see [Streaming Flat-File IDOCs in SAP using the WCF Channel Model](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/stream-flat-file-idocs-in-sap-using-the-wcf-channel-model.md).  
  
## How Do I Receive Operations from a SAP System Using an IReplyChannel?  
 To receive operations from a SAP system by using the WCF channel model, perform the following steps.  
  
#### To receive operations from the SAP system using an IReplyChannel  
  
1.  Create an instance of **SAPBinding** and set the binding properties required to for the operations you want to receive. At a minimum you must set the **AcceptCredentialsInUri** binding property to true. To act as a tRFC server, you must set the **TidDatabaseConnectionString** binding property. For more information about binding properties, see [Read about BizTalk Adapter for mySAP Business Suite Binding Properties](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/read-about-biztalk-adapter-for-mysap-business-suite-binding-properties.md).  
  
    ```  
    SAPBinding binding = new SAPBinding();  
    binding.AcceptCredentialsInUri = true;  
    ```  
  
2.  Create a **BindingParameterCollection** and add an **InboundActionCollection** that contains the actions of the operations that you want to receive. The adapter will return an exception to the SAP system for all other operations. This step is optional. For more information, see [Receiving Inbound Operations from the SAP System Using the WCF Channel Model](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/receive-inbound-operations-from-the-sap-system-using-the-wcf-channel-model.md).  
  
    ```  
    InboundActionCollection actions = new InboundActionCollection(listeneraddress);  
    actions.Add("http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Rfc/Z_RFC_MKD_DIV");  
    BindingParameterCollection bpcol = new BindingParameterCollection();  
    bpcol.Add(actions);  
    ```  
  
3.  Create a channel listener by invoking **BuildChannelListener<IReplyChannel\>** method on the **SAPBinding** and open it. You specify the SAP connection URI as one of the parameters to this method. The connection URI must contain parameters for an RFC Destination on the SAP system. For more information about the SAP connection URI, see [Create the SAP system connection URI](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/create-the-sap-system-connection-uri.md). If you created a **BindingParameterCollection** in step 3, you also specify this when you create the channel listener.  
  
    ```  
    Uri listeneraddress =  
        new Uri("sap://User=YourUserName;Passwd=YourPassword;Client=800;Lang=EN;@a/YourSAPHost/00?ListenerGwServ=SAPGATEWAY&ListenerGwHost=YourSAPHost&ListenerProgramId=SAPAdapter");  
    IChannelListener<IReplyChannel> listener = binding.BuildChannelListener<IReplyChannel>(connectionUri, bpcol);  
    listener.Open();  
    ```  
  
4.  Get an **IReplyChannel** channel by invoking the **AcceptChannel** method on the listener and open it.  
  
    ```  
    IReplyChannel channel = listener.AcceptChannel();  
    channel.Open();  
    ```  
  
5.  Invoke **ReceiveRequest** on the channel to get the request message for the next operation from the adapter.  
  
    ```  
    RequestContext rc = channel.ReceiveRequest();  
    ```  
  
6.  Consume the request message sent by the adapter. You get the request message from the **RequestMessage** property of the **RequestContext**. You can consume the message using either an **XmlReader** or an **XmlDictionaryWriter**.  
  
    ```  
    XmlReader reader = (XmlReader)rc.RequestMessage.GetReaderAtBodyContents();  
    ```  
  
7.  Complete the operation by returning a response or fault to the SAP system:  
  
    1.  Process the message and return a response to the SAP system by returning the response message to the adapter. This example returns an empty message.  
  
        ```  
        respMessage = Message.CreateMessage(MessageVersion.Default, rc.RequestMessage.Headers.Action + "/response");  
        rc.Reply(respMessage);  
        ```  
  
    2.  Return an exception to the SAP system by returning a fault message to the adapter. You can use any value for the message action, fault code, and reason.  
  
        ```  
        MessageFault fault = MessageFault.CreateFault(new FaultCode("ProcFault"), "Processing Error");  
        Message respMessage = Message.CreateMessage(MessageVersion.Default, fault, String.Empty);  
        rc.Reply(respMessage);  
        ```  
  
8.  Close the request context after you have sent the message.  
  
    ```  
    rc.Close();  
    ```  
  
9. Close the channel when you have completed processing the request.  
  
    ```  
    channel.Close()  
    ```  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >  You must close the channel after you have finished processing the operation. Failure to close the channel may affect the behavior of your code.  
  
10. Close the listener when you are finished receiving operations from the SAP system.  
  
    ```  
    listener.Close()  
    ```  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >  You must explicitly close the listener when you are done using it; otherwise, your program may not behave properly. Closing the listener does not close channels created using the listener. You must also explicitly close each channel created using the listener.  
  
### Example  
 The following example receives an RFC, Z_RFC_MKD_DIV from the SAP system. This RFC divides two numbers. The implementation in this example uses an **InboundActionCollection** to filter for the Z_RFC_MKD_DIV operation and does the following when a message is received:  
  
-   If the divisor is non-zero, it writes the result of the division to the console and returns it to the SAP system.  
  
-   If the divisor is zero, it writes the resulting exception message to the console and returns a fault to the SAP system.  
  
-   If any other operation is sent by the SAP system, it writes a message to the console. In this case, the adapter itself returns a fault to the SAP system.

// 2)  A binding parameter collection is created with an InboundAction collection that specifies  
//     target RFC (Z_RFC_MKD_DIV) so that only messages with this action will be received by the  
//     listener (and channel).  
// 3)  An <IReplyChannel> listener is created from the binding and binding parameter collection  
// 4)  A channel is created and opened to receive a request  
// 6)  When Z_RFC_MKD_DIV is received the two parameters are divided and the parameters and result  
//     are written to the console, then the result is returned to the adapter by using a template  
//     message.  
// 7)  If a divide by 0 occurs the exception message is written to the console and a  
//     fault is returned to the SAP system  
// 8)  If any other operation is received an error message is written to the console and the adapter  
///    returns a fault to the SAP system  
// 9)  IMPORTANT you must close the channel and listener to deregister them from the SAP Program ID.
