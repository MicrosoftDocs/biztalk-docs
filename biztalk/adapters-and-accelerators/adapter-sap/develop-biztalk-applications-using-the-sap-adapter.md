# Develop BizTalk applications using the SAP adapter
Developing BizTalk applications involves creating a BizTalk project in [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] and using the [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservlong](../../includes/consumeadapterservlong-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[addadapterwiz](../../includes/addadapterwiz-md.md)] to generate XML schema. Once you have generated the schema, you can either use Content-Based Routing (CBR) or create BizTalk orchestrations to send and receive messages that conform to the generated schema.  
  
 CBR can be used in scenarios where the messages being sent to the SAP system do not require any intensive processing. For example, if you know that the receive port will be receiving messages only of a certain type, you can add a filter to the send port to route the messages matching the filter expression to the send port.  
  
 In BizTalk orchestrations, you create send and receive ports to send and receive messages to and from the [!INCLUDE[wcfadapter_short](../../includes/wcfadapter-short-md.md)], which in turn sends the messages to [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)]. This section provides information about using BizTalk orchestrations to perform operations on the SAP system using the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)]. The [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] in turn uses the [!INCLUDE[wcfadapter_short](../../includes/wcfadapter-short-md.md)] adapter that can interact with a WCF binding.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  To use the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] with Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], you must always set the **EnableBizTalkCompatibilityMode** binding property to **True**. For information about how to set binding properties, see [Configure the binding properties for the SAP adapter](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/configure-the-binding-properties-for-the-sap-adapter.md).
