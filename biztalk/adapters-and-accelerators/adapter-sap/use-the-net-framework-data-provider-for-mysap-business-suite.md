# Use the .NET Framework Data Provider for mySAP Business Suite
This section provides instructions on using the [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersaplong](../../includes/adoprovidersaplong-md.md)]. For information about the custom RFC used by [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersapshort](../../includes/adoprovidersapshort-md.md)] and the limitations of the provider see [About the .NET Framework Data Provider for mySAP Business Suite](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/about-the-net-framework-data-provider-for-mysap-business-suite.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Even if you chose to install the [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersapshort](../../includes/adoprovidersapshort-md.md)] as part of the [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)] installation, you must install some custom RFCs at the SAP system to use the [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersapshort](../../includes/adoprovidersapshort-md.md)].
