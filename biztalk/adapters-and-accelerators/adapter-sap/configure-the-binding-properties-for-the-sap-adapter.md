# Configure the binding properties for the SAP adapter
The [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] surfaces several binding properties that enable you to control some of its behavioral characteristics. This section provides information about setting the binding properties from Visual Studio (design time) and from the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console (run time). At design time, you must specify the binding properties to generate schema for specific operations. At run time, you must specify the binding properties as part of the send or receive port for sending or receiving messages from the SAP system.  

 For information about the binding properties, including a list of binding properties for [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)], see [Read about BizTalk Adapter for mySAP Business Suite binding properties](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/read-about-biztalk-adapter-for-mysap-business-suite-binding-properties.md).  

## Enter Binding Properties at Design Time  
 For design time, you can specify the binding properties using the [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservshort](../../includes/consumeadapterservshort-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[addadapterwiz](../../includes/addadapterwiz-md.md)].  

### Enter binding properties using Consume Adapter Service Add-in  

1.  Right-click your BizTalk project, point to **Add**, and then click **Add Generated Items**.  

2.  In the **Add Generated Items** dialog box, do the following:  

    |Use this|To do this|  
    |--------------|----------------|  
    |**Categories**|Click **Consume Adapter Service**.|  
    |**Templates**|Click **Consume Adapter Service**.|  

3.  To start the **Consume Adapter Service** dialog box, click **Add**.  

4.  In the **Consume Adapter Service** dialog box, from the **Select a binding** drop-down list select **sapBinding**, and click **Configure**.  

5.  In the **Configure Adapter** dialog box, click the **Binding Properties** tab, and then specify the different binding properties.  

6.  Click **OK**.  

### Enter binding properties using Add Adapter Metadata Wizard  

1. Right-click your BizTalk project, point to **Add**, and then click **Add Generated Items**.  

2. In the **Add Generated Items** dialog box, do the following:  


   |    Use this    |           To do this            |
   |----------------|---------------------------------|
   | **Categories** |     Click **Add Adapter**.      |
   | **Templates**  | Click **Add Adapter Metadata**. |


3. Click **Add**. The [!INCLUDE[addadapterwiz](../../includes/addadapterwiz-md.md)] opens.  

4. In the Add Adapter Wizard, select **WCF-SAP**. Select the computer on which BizTalk Server is installed and the name of the BizTalk database.  

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   >  If you already have a WCF-SAP port configured in BizTalk, select the port from the **Port** list.  

5. Click **Next**.  

6. In the **Consume Adapter Service** dialog box, from the **Select a binding** drop-down list select **sapBinding**, and click **Configure**.  

7. Click the **Binding Properties** tab and specify the binding values, if any, which are required to be specified before generating the schema. For example, you must specify a value for the **GenerateFlatFileCompatibleIDoc** property before generating schema for receiving IDOC from an SAP system. For more information about binding properties, see [Read about BizTalk Adapter for mySAP Business Suite binding properties](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/read-about-biztalk-adapter-for-mysap-business-suite-binding-properties.md).  

   > [!NOTE]
   >  If you selected an existing WCF-SAP send port, you need not specify the binding properties. The binding properties are picked from the send port configuration. However, you may choose to specify the binding properties that are required at design-time, if any. In such case, the new values for binding properties will be used at design-time while generating the metadata. However, at run-time the values specified for binding properties in the send port configuration will be applicable.  

8. Click **OK**.  

## Enter Binding Properties at Run Time  
 For run time, you can specify the binding properties as part of the WCF-Custom port or WCF-SAP configuration in the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console.  

### Enter binding properties for the WCF-Custom port  

1. Start the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console.  

2. In the console tree, expand **BizTalk Group**, then expand **Applications**, and then expand the application under which you want to create a port, and click **Send Ports** or **Receive Ports**. In the right pane, you can choose to create a port or select an existing port.  

3. In the **Port Properties** dialog box, from the **Type** drop-down list, select **WCF-Custom**, and then click **Configure**.  

   > [!NOTE]
   >  To see the location properties dialog box for a receive port, click the **Receive Location** tab on the left pane of the port properties dialog box, and then click **New**.  

4. In the **WCF-Custom Transport Properties** dialog box, click the **Binding** tab.  

5. From the **Binding Type** drop-down list, select **sapBinding**.  

6. In the **Configuration** box, specify the values for the different binding properties, and then click **OK**.  

### Enter binging properties for the WCF-SAP port  

1. Start the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console.  

2. Add the WCF-SAP adapter to the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console. For instructions, see [Add the SAP Adapter to BizTalk Server Administration Console](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/add-the-sap-adapter-to-biztalk-server-administration-console.md).  

3. In the console tree, expand **BizTalk Group**, then expand **Applications**, and then expand the application under which you want to create a port, and click **Send Ports** or **Receive Ports**. In the right pane, you can choose to create a port or select an existing port.  

4. In the port properties dialog box, from the **Type** drop-down list, select the WCF-SAP adapter you added earlier, and then click **Configure**.  

   > [!NOTE]
   >  To see the location properties dialog box for a receive port, click the **Receive Location** tab on the left pane of the port properties dialog box, and then click **New**.  

5. In the transport properties dialog box, click the **Binding** tab and specify values for binding properties.  

   > [!NOTE]
   >  The binding properties are displayed based on whether you are configuring a send port or a receive port. For example, binding properties related to inbound operations are not available while configuring a send port because inbound operations require a receive port configuration.  

6. Click **OK**.
