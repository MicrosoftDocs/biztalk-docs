# Basic SAP Data Types
The parameter types that the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap](../../includes/adaptersap-md.md)] supports are governed by the:  

- ABAP data types that SAP supports  

- Database data types that SAP supports  

  This section presents a mapping between the ABAP and database data types, and their corresponding .NET and XML schema types.  

> [!NOTE]
>  The information in this section applies to RFCs, tRFCs, and BAPIs. SAP data types are always represented as strings (xsd:string) in IDOCs. This is to support the BizTalk Server flat file parser.  

## Supported ABAP Data Types  
 The [!INCLUDE[adaptersap](../../includes/adaptersap-md.md)] supports safe typing for some ABAP data types. When safe typing is enabled, these data types are represented as strings. You configure safe typing by setting the **EnableSafeTyping** binding property. Safe typing is disabled by default. For more information about the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] binding properties, see [Read about BizTalk Adapter for mySAP Business Suite binding properties](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/read-about-biztalk-adapter-for-mysap-business-suite-binding-properties.md).  

 The following table shows how the ABAP data types are surfaced when safe typing is not enabled. (**EnableSafeTyping** is false). Data types that are surfaced differently when safe typing is enabled are marked with an asterisk (*).  

|ABAP Data Type|RFC Type|XSD type|.NET type|Format string|  
|--------------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|-------------------|  
|I (Integer)|RFC_INT|xsd:int|Int32|-|  
|Internal (RFC_INT1)|RFC_INT1|xsd:unsignedByte|Byte|-|  
|Internal (RFC_INT2)|RFC_INT2|xsd:short|Int16|-|  
|F (Float)|RFC_FLOAT|xsd:double|Double|-|  
|P (BCD number)|RFC_BCD|xsd:decimal if length <= 28<br />xsd:string if length > 28|Decimal<br />String|Decimal number. with 0 decimal places<br />Decimal number. with >0 decimal places|  
|C (Character)|RFC_CHAR|xsd:string|String|-|  
|D (Date: YYYYMMDD)*|RFC_DATE|xsd:dateTime|DateTime|Internally, the adapter deserializes the value into a **DateTime** object. It then invokes the **DateTime.ToUniversalTime** method to convert the value of this object to UTC. Finally the date component (**DateTime.Date**) is used to create the value that is sent to the SAP system. The SAP system treats this date value as local time.<br /><br /> You should specify date values as UTC to avoid conversion.<br /><br /> -   For xsd:dateTime, the following pattern is recommended: "(\d\d\d\d-\d\d-\d\d)T(00:00:00)(.\*)Z".<br />-   For **DateTime** objects set **DateTime.Kind** to **DateTimeKind.Utc**.|  
|T (Time: HHMMSS)*|RFC_TIME|xsd:dateTime|DateTime|Internally, the adapter deserializes the value into a **DateTime** object. It then invokes the **DateTime.ToUniversalTime** method to convert the value of this object to UTC. Finally the time component (**DateTime.Time**) is used to create the value that is sent to the SAP system. The SAP system treats this time value as local time.<br /><br /> You should specify time values as UTC to avoid conversion.<br /><br /> -   For xsd:dateTime, the following pattern is recommended: "(0001-01-01)T(\d\d:\d\d:\d\d)(.\*)".<br />-   For **DateTime** objects set **DateTime.Kind** to **DateTimeKind.Utc**.<br /><br /> For example, if your local time is 9:15 am, express this as "(001-01-01)T(09:15:00)Z"|  
|N (Numeric string)*|RFC_NUM|xsd:int if lenrth <= 9<br />xsd:long if length > 9 and <= 19<br />xsd:string if length > 19|Int32<br />long<br />String|-|  
|X (Byte)|RFC_BYTE|xsd:base64Binary|Byte[]|-|  
|STRING|RFC_STRING|xsd:string|String|-|  
|XSTRING|RFC_BYTE|xsd:base64Binary|Byte[]|-|  

 *Indicates that the data type is surfaced differently when safe typing is enabled.  

### Safe Typing Enabled  
 The following table shows the ABAP data types that are surfaced differently when safe typing is enabled (the **EnableSafeTyping** binding property is true).  

|ABAP Data Type|RFC Type|XSD type|.NET type|Format string|  
|--------------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|-------------------|  
|D (Date: YYYYMMDD)|RFC_DATE|xsd:string|String|SAP date format: YYYYMMDD.<br /><br /> Characters are allowed for date digits, so the value is essentially an eight character string|  
|T (Time: HHMMSS)|RFC_TIME|xsd:string|String|SAP time format: HHMMSS.<br /><br /> Characters are allowed for time digits, so the value is essentially a six character string|  
|N (Numeric string)|RFC_NUM|xsd:string|String|An n character string; where n = length of the numc field.|  

 ABAP data types that are not in this table are surfaced in the same way as when safe typing is not enabled.  

### Support for Date and Time Fields  
 When safe typing is not enabled, ABAP Date (D) and Time (T) types are surfaced as xsd:dateTime; however, the pattern facet surfaced for the Date and Time types is different.  

-   The pattern facet for Date is: `(\d\d\d\d-\d\d-\d\d)T(00:00:00)(.*)`  

     For example, July 7, 2007 (2007-07-07) is represented as:  

     `(2007-07-07)T(00:00:00)`.  

-   The pattern facet for Time is: `(0001-01-01)T(\d\d:\d\d:\d\d)(.*)`  

     For example, 18:30:30 (6:30 pm and 30 seconds) is represented as:  

     `(0001-01-01)T(18:30:30)`.  

#### How does the Adapter Represent Minimum and Maximum Time Values on Inbound Messages (from SAP)?  
 The [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] uses the following guidelines when it receives time values from the SAP system:  

-   The adapter treats 000000 (hhmmss) and 240000 (hhmmss) as 0 hours, 0 mins, and 0 seconds.  

## Supported Database Data Types  
 The way in which the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap](../../includes/adaptersap-md.md)] surfaces database data types also depends on whether safe typing is enabled. The following table shows how the adapter surfaces database data types when safe typing is not enabled (the **EnableSafeTyping** binding property is false). Data types that are surfaced differently when safe typing is enabled are marked with an asterisk (*).

|     TIMS (Time field)\*     |  RFC_TIME  | xsd:datetime<br /><br /> Internally, the adapter deserializes the value into a **DateTime** object. It then invokes the **DateTime.ToUniversalTime** method to convert the value of this object to UTC. Finally the time component (**DateTime.Time**) is used to create the value that is sent to the SAP system. The SAP system treats this time value as local time.<br /><br /> You should specify time values as UTC to avoid conversion. The following pattern is recommended: "(0001-01-01)T(\d\d:\d\d:\d\d)(.\*)Z".<br /><br /> For example, if your local time is 9:15 am, express this as "(001-01-01)T(09:15:00)Z" | DateTime<br /><br /> You should specify time values as UTC (DateTime.Kind = DateTimeKind.Utc) to avoid conversion. |

 *Indicates that the adapter surfaces the data type differently when safe typing is enabled.  

### Safe Typing Enabled  
 The following table shows the database data types that are surfaced differently when safe typing is enabled (the **EnableSafeTyping** binding property is true).  

|Database Data Type|RFC Type|XSD|.NET type|String Value Format|  
|------------------------|--------------|---------|---------------|-------------------------|  
|ACCP (Posting Period)|RFC_NUM|xsd:string|String|Character string|  
|NUMC|RFC_NUM|xsd:string|String|Character string|  
|DATS (Date field)|RFC_DATE|xsd:string|String|YYYYMMDD|  
|TIMS (Time field)|RFC_TIME|xsd:string|String|HHMMSS|  

 Data types that are not in this table are surfaced in the same way as when safe typing is not enabled.  

## Supported XSD Facets  
 The [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] supports the following XSD facets.  

|RFC Type|XSD Facet (**EnableSafeTyping** = false)|XSD Facet (**EnableSafeTyping** = true)|

|RFC_NUM|**XSD totalDigits facet** if length <=19<br /><br /> **XSD pattern facet** if length > 19|**XSD maxLength facet (depends on the length of the value on SAP)**|  
|RFC_DATE|**XSD pattern facet**<br /><br /> `"(\d\d\d\d-\d\d-\d\d)T(00:00:00)(.*)"`<br /><br /> Pattern contains time 00:00:00 to be compatible with `xsd:datetime`|**XSD maxLength facet = 8**|

|RFC_CHAR|**XSD maxLength facet**|same|
