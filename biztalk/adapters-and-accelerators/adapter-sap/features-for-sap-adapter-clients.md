# Features for SAP adapter clients
In addition to the features discussed throughout the topics of [Architecture overview of BizTalk Adapter for mySAP Business Suite](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/architecture-overview-of-the-biztalk-adapter-for-mysap-business-suite.md), the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] also provides the following features that are useful for adapter clients.  
  
- **Support for configuring adapters using binding properties**. Adapter clients can configure the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] by specifying certain binding properties. For example, clients can configure the adapter to specify the maximum number of connections in the adapter's connection pool by specifying a value for the **MaxConnectionsPerSystem** binding property. For more information, see [Read about BizTalk Adapter for mySAP Business Suite Binding Properties](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/read-about-biztalk-adapter-for-mysap-business-suite-binding-properties.md).  
  
- **Support for dynamic ports in BizTalk Server**. Through the BizTalk [!INCLUDE[wcfadapter_short](../../includes/wcfadapter-short-md.md)], the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] supports a dynamic port that enables dynamic routing of messages from [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] based on the message context properties. For more information, see [Configure dynamic ports](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/configure-dynamic-ports-in-the-sap-adapter.md).
  
- **Support for message versioning**. The [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] supports message versioning to enable support for different message schemas in future releases of the [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)]. For more information, see [Message Versioning Support](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/message-versioning-support1.md).  
  
  > [!NOTE]
  >  This feature does not provide backward compatibility with the earlier versions of the adapter.  
  
- **Support for performance counters**. The [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] supports WCF-based performance counters for use by adapter clients. For more information about performance counters, see [Use Performance Counters with the SAP adapter](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/use-performance-counters-with-the-sap-adapter.md).
