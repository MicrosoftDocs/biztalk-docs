# Develop your SAP applications

## Overview
The [!INCLUDE[adaptersap](../../includes/adaptersap-md.md)] is a [!INCLUDE[firstref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/firstref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] custom binding. Client applications can consume the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] to invoke operations on SAP artifacts. The [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] can be consumed:  
  
- Through a physical port binding in a [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion_md](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] solution.  
  
- By invoking methods on an instance of a client proxy.  
  
- As a hosted WCF service.  
  
- By sending SOAP messages over a channel instance in code that uses the WCF channel model.  
  
- Through an ADO.NET interface.  

## BizTalk vs WCF service vs WCF channel vs ADO.NET
  
 The following table:  
  
- Lists the different operations that can be performed on an SAP system using the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)].  
  
- Indicates which of the approaches ([!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], WCF service model, WCF channel model, or ADO.NET interface) can be used to perform the operations.  
  
- Provides links to more information about performing the task using the chosen approach.
