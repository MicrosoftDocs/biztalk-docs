# Manually configure a physical port binding to the SAP adapter
Configure the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap](../../includes/adaptersap-md.md)] as a WCF custom binding by using the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console. 

## Port overview
After deploying the adapter, you will be able to send and receive messages from the SAP system by using the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console. The steps for deploying the adapter vary depending on:  
  
- The direction of communication between [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)]. You may choose to configure a Send, Receive, Send-Receive, or a Receive-Send port. Your choices are summarized in the following table:  
  
  |Port direction|Communication pattern|Direction of communication to choose from|  
  |---|---|---|  
  |Send|One-way|I will always be sending messages on this port.|  
  |Receive|One-way|I will always be receiving messages on this port.|  
  |Send-Receive|Request-response|I will be sending a request and receiving a response.|  
  |Receive-Send|Solicit-response|I will be receiving a request and sending a response.|  
  
   For more information, see [Create a Send Port](../../core/how-to-create-a-send-port2.md), or [Create a Receive Port](../../core/how-to-create-a-receive-port.md).
  
- Whether the adapter sends messages to the SAP system or receives messages from the SAP system. Depending on whether you want to send or receive messages, you will create a send or receive port.  
  
  > [!NOTE]
  >  You can also configure the send or receive ports by importing a binding configuration file that is created by the [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservshort](../../includes/consumeadapterservshort-md.md)] as part of metadata generation. For instructions on configuring ports using this binding file, see [Configure a physical port binding using a port binding file to SAP](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/configure-a-physical-port-binding-using-a-port-binding-file-to-sap.md).
