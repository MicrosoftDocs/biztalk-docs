# Secure your SAP applications
The SAP system can contain sensitive business information such as customer account details. Applications that use the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap](../../includes/adaptersap-md.md)] to access and modify this information either locally or across a distributed network might inadvertently expose it to access by unauthorized actors, unless efforts are made to protect and secure the data during transmission. Data protection and security are usually thought of in the following terms:  
  
- *Authorization* controls access to a resource based on the identity of the requestor.  
  
- *Authentication* provides mechanisms for verifying the identity of a requestor.  
  
- *Data confidentiality* provides mechanisms for protecting the privacy of data through encryption.  
  
- *Data integrity* provides mechanisms to digitally sign data, so that the receiver can ensure that the data has not been altered in-transit.  
  
  The topics in this section provide guidelines to help you better secure the solutions that you develop with the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)].
