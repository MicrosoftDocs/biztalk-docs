# Limitations of the .NET Framework Data Provider for mySAP Business Suite
The following are known limitations of the [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersaplong](../../includes/adoprovidersaplong-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[adoprovidersapshort](../../includes/adoprovidersapshort-md.md)]):  
  
- The [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersapshort](../../includes/adoprovidersapshort-md.md)] does not support connecting to an SAP system using Secure Network Connection (SNC). For more information about SNC, see [Security between the SAP system and the adapter](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/security-between-the-sap-system-and-the-adapter.md).
  
- The [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersapshort](../../includes/adoprovidersapshort-md.md)] does not support the `DbType` or `Size` properties of the `SAPParameter`. Instead, when the user specifies a value for the `SAPParameter`, the value is cast internally to a .NET data type according to the established mapping between .NET and SAP data types.  
  
- The maximum length allowed for field values of SAP data types `CURR`, `DEC`, and `QUAN` is 29 digits. Although SAP provides 31 places for these data-type values natively, the .NET decimal data type to which they are converted imposes a 29-digit limit.  
  
- A mapping limitation between the .NET data type `Double` and the SAP `FLTP` data type can cause an overflow error when reading data from the SAP system into the .NET type. Although the .NET type can represent a double-precision 64-bit number with values ranging from negative 1.79769313486232e308 to positive 1.79769313486232e308, an SAP `FLTP` type parsed by the [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersapshort](../../includes/adoprovidersapshort-md.md)] cannot exceed 1.8446744073709552E+19; the effective limit for the `FLTP` type is the range negative 1.8446744073709552E+19 to positive 1.8446744073709552E+19.  
  
- Due to issues with timeout handling by the underlying client library, the [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersapshort](../../includes/adoprovidersapshort-md.md)] does not support command and connection timeout.  
  
- The [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersapshort](../../includes/adoprovidersapshort-md.md)] does not support asynchronous command behavior.  
  
- When used with a SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) project, the [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersapshort](../../includes/adoprovidersapshort-md.md)] fails to retrieve data for columns that contain values with more than 8000 characters. This is due to an SSIS restriction according to which:  
  
  -   Values greater than 4000 characters in SSIS variable are not supported.  
  
  -   Values greater than 4000 wide characters are not supported.  
  
  -   Values greater than 8000 single-byte characters are not supported.
