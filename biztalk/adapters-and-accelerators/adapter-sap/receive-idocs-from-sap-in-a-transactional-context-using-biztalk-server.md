# Receive IDOCs from SAP in a Transactional Context using BizTalk Server
Receiving IDOC in a transactional context is similar to receiving tRFCs in a transactional context. In such a case, the IDOC received from the SAP system contains a TID as part of the *\<TransactionalRfcOperationIdentifier\>* element. This TID is persisted in a SQL database by the adapter. If the ABAP code in the SAP system that sends the IDOC has a "COMMIT WORK" statement, the TID is deleted from the SQL database after a response is sent back to the SAP system.  
  
 The orchestration required to receive an IDOC is similar irrespective of whether the IDOC is received in a transactional context or not. See [Receive IDOCs from SAP by Using BizTalk Server](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/receive-idocs-from-sap-using-biztalk-server.md). However, you need to perform certain additional tasks to make sure the IDOCs are received in a transactional context.  
  
1.  At design time, generate the schema for an IDOC that you want to receive.  
  
2.  At run time, make sure you set the binding property **TidDatabaseConnectionString**. This property takes the connection string to connect to a SQL database to store the TID. A sample connection string would look like:  
  
    ```  
    Data Source=<myServerAddress>;Initial Catalog=<myDataBase>;User Id=<myUsername>;Password=<myPassword>;  
    ```  
  
     For more information about the binding property and how to set it, see [Read about BizTalk Adapter for mySAP Business Suite Binding Properties](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/read-about-biztalk-adapter-for-mysap-business-suite-binding-properties.md).  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >  The [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)] setup wizard installs a SQL script, SapAdapter-DbScript-Install.sql, which must be run by the SQL Server administrator to create a database and the database objects in SQL Server. The script is typically installed at *\<installation drive\>*:Program FilesMicrosoft [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)].  
    >   
    >  The [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] uses these objects to persist the TIDs. So, the SQL Server administrator must ensure that the user name provide as part of the connection string has sufficient privileges to execute the stored procedures. You can also opt for Windows authentication provided the Windows user has sufficient permissions to execute stored procedures in the database.  
  
3.  Make sure MSDTC is enabled on the computer where the adapter is installed. Perform the following steps to enable MSDTC.  
  
    1.  Start the Component Services MMC snap-in.  
  
    2.  In the Component Services MMC snap-in, from the left pane expand **Component Services**, expand **Computers**, right-click **My Computer**, and click **Properties**.  
  
    3.  In the **My Computer Properties** dialog box, click the **MSDTC** tab.  
  
    4.  In the **Transaction Configuration** section, click the **Security Configuration** button.  
  
    5.  In the **Security Configuration** dialog box, select the **Network DTC Access** check box and within that, select the **Allow Remote Clients** check box.  
  
    6.  In the **Transaction Manager Communication** section, select the **Allow Inbound** and **Allow Outbound** check boxes.  
  
    7.  In the **Security Configuration** dialog box, click **OK**.  
  
    8.  Click **Yes** in the dialog box informing that the MSDTC service will be restarted. After the MSDTC service is restarted, click **OK** on the dialog box.  
  
    9. In the **My Computer Properties** dialog box, click **OK**.  
  
4.  Add MSDTC to the Windows Firewall exception list, if not already added. Run the following command.  
  
    ```  
    netsh firewall set allowedprogram %windir%\system32\msdtc.exe MSDTC enable  
    ```
