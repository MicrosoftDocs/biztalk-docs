# SAP GUI tasks for the SAP adapter scenarios

## Overview
For many scenarios involving the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap](../../includes/adaptersap-md.md)] and the SAP system, you need to perform certain operations on the SAP system. For example, to receive an RFC call into the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)], you first send an RFC from the SAP system. This section lists the high-level steps to complete these tasks on the SAP system.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  To do these tasks, we suggest contacting your SAP administrator, or refer to the SAP guidance.
