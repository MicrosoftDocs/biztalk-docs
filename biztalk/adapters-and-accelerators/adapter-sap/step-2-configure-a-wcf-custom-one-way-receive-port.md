# Step 2: Configure a WCF-Custom One-way Receive Port
![Step 2 of 3](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-database/media/step-2of3.gif "Step_2of3")

 **Time to complete:** 10 minutes

 **Objective:** In this step, you configure a WCF-Custom port to receive a flat-file IDOC from an SAP system. After configuring the port, you configure the BizTalk application to use the WCF-Custom receive port.

## Prerequisites
 You must have built and deployed your vPrev BizTalk project to receive IDOCs from an SAP system.

### To configure a WCF-Custom one-way receive port

1. Start the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console.

2. In the console tree, expand **BizTalk Group**, and then expand **Applications**.

3. Expand the application under which you want create the receive port.

4. Right-click **Receive Ports**, point to **New**, and click **One-way Receive Port**.

5. In the **Receive Port Properties** dialog box, on the **General** tab, type a name for the receive port.

6. On the **Receive Locations** tab, click **New**. The **Receive Location Properties** dialog box appears.

7. In the **Receive Location Properties** dialog box, do the following:

   1.  Specify a name for the receive location.

   2.  From the **Type** drop-down list, select **WCF-Custom**, and then click **Configure**.

8. In the **WCF-Custom Transport Properties** dialog box, do the following:

   1. Click the **General** tab, and in the **Address (URI)** field, specify the connection URI to receive messages from the SAP system. The connection URI to receive messages from the SAP system must be in the following format:

      ```
      sap://Client=800;lang=EN@A/YourSAPHOST/00?ListenerGwHost=YourSAPHOST&ListenerGwServ=SAPGW00&ListenerProgramId=MyProgramId
      ```

       The following figure shows the port properties dialog box with the URI specified:

       ![Connection URI to receive messages from SAP](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/media/91e12582-aea3-4f13-8cdc-af69a9a11a5c.gif "91e12582-aea3-4f13-8cdc-af69a9a11a5c")

       For more information about the connection URI, see [Create a  connection to the SAP system](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/create-a-connection-to-the-sap-system.md).

   2. Click the **Binding** tab, and from the **Binding Type** drop-down list, select **sapBinding**. Make sure you specify the following binding properties for the receive port.

      |Binding property|Set value to|
      |----------------------|------------------|
      |flatFileSegmentIndicator|**SegmentType**. This indicates that the flat files should contain the segment type for each segment in the IDOC.|
      |padReceivedIdocWithSpaces|**True**. Specifies whether each line in the IDOC is padded with spaces to the correct length.|
      |receiveIDocFormat|**String**. This specifies that the IDOC message should be represented as a single string field.|

       For more information about binding properties, see [Read about BizTalk Adapter for mySAP Business Suite Binding Properties](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/read-about-biztalk-adapter-for-mysap-business-suite-binding-properties.md).

   3. Click the **Others** tab, and specify the credentials to connect to an SAP system.

   4. Click the **Messages** tab, and in the **Inbound BizTalk message body** section, choose the **Path** option.

   5. In the **Body path expression** text box, specify the XPath query to extract the flat-file IDOC from the XML message. By doing so, the receive port extracts the data from the IDOC and trims the XML tag that is part of the **ReceiveIdoc** operation for the WCF-based [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)]. For more information about the message schema for the **ReceiveIdoc** operation, see [Message Schemas for IDOC Operations](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/message-schemas-for-idoc-operations.md).

       ![XPath query to extract the flat&#45;file IDOC](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/media/8b5b8165-a1e7-40ef-bcf7-de3149c6deb0.gif "8b5b8165-a1e7-40ef-bcf7-de3149c6deb0")

       You must specify the following XPath query:

      ```
      /*[local-name()='ReceiveIdoc']/*[local-name()='idocData']
      ```

   6. From the **Node encoding** drop-down list, select **String**.

   7. Click **Apply**, and then click **OK**.

9. In the Receive Location Properties dialog box, from the **Receive handler** drop-down list, select **BizTalkServerApplication**.

10. From the **Receive pipeline** drop-down list, select **ConvertToXML**. This flat-file disassembler pipeline is already a part of the vPrev BizTalk project to convert a flat-file IDOC to an XML IDOC.

11. Click **OK**.

### To configure the BizTalk application

1. In the BizTalk Server Administration console, expand **BizTalk Group**, expand **Applications**, and expand the BizTalk Application where the orchestration is deployed.

2. Right-click the BizTalk application, and then select **Configure**.

3. From the left pane, click the orchestration to configure. From the right pane, from the **Host** drop-down list, select a BizTalk host instance.

4. Under the **Bindings** box, map the logical ports of the BizTalk orchestration to the physical ports in the BizTalk Server Administration console.

   1. Select the WCF-Custom receive port you created earlier in this topic.

   2. Select a file port where you will receive the flat-file IDOC.

   3. Click **OK**.

      For more information on configuring apps in BizTalk Server, see [How to Configure an Application](../../core/how-to-configure-an-application.md).

## Next Steps
 You have now completed migration of your vPrev BizTalk project to a BizTalk project that receives IDOCs from an SAP system using the WCF-based [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)]. You must now test the migrated BizTalk application by receiving a flat-file IDOC, as described in [Step 3: Test the Migrated Application](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/step-3-test-the-migrated-application5.md).
