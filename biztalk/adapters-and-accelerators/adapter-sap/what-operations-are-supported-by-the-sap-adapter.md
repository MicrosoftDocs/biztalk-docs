# What operations are supported by the SAP adapter
Adapter clients can perform operations on the SAP system by creating BizTalk projects, by using the WCF channel model, or by using the WCF service model. The [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] exposes operations that applications can invoke on it and that it can, in turn, invoke on applications. These operations are invoked by sending SOAP messages over a channel. If a response is required, it is returned in a SOAP message over the same channel. For information about the message structure and the SOAP action associated with each operation, see [Messages and Message Schemas for BizTalk Adapter for mySAP Business Suite](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/messages-and-message-schemas-for-biztalk-adapter-for-mysap-business-suite.md).  
  
 This section provides information about the operations supported on the SAP system using the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)].
