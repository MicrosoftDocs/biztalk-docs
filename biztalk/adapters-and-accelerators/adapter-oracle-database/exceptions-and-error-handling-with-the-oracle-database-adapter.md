# Exceptions and error handling with the Oracle Database adapter
This section lists the exceptions that the [!INCLUDE[adapteroracle](../../includes/adapteroracle-md.md)] throws. These can contain:  
  
- An inner exception, which is a system exception that the .NET Framework throws.  
  
- An LOB exception that the LOB client library throws.  
  
  For more information about the inner exception, see the respective .NET Framework or Oracle documentation. Exceptions also contain a detailed error message that helps in resolving the problem.
