# Run Composite Operations in Oracle Database
The [!INCLUDE[adapteroracle_short](../../includes/adapteroracle-short-md.md)] enables adapter clients to perform composite operations that can include any number of the following operations, and in any order:  
  
- Select, Insert, Update, and Delete operations on tables and views.  
  
- Stored procedures, functions, and procedures or functions within packages that are surfaced as operations in the adapter.  
  
  The operations in a composite operation can target tables and views in the same database or different databases. However, data cannot be shared or reused across different operations in a composite operation. For example, in a composite operation, the result set of a Select operation cannot be used as the input parameter for a stored procedure.  
  
  Each operation in a composite operation is performed using a separate connection. The [!INCLUDE[adapteroracle_short](../../includes/adapteroracle-short-md.md)] consumes as many connections from the ODP.NET connection pool as the number of operations in a composite operation, and then releases the connections as the operations get executed. However, if an operation in the composite operation returns a result set, the connection is released only after the message is consumed.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  If you experience time-out issues while executing a composite operation then it could be because the number of connections is less than the number of operations in a composite operation involving:  
> 
> - Stored procedures containing BFILE, BLOB, CLOB, NCLOB, and REF CURSOR as OUT or IN OUT parameters.  
>   -   Select operation.  
> 
>   To resolve this issue, you must ensure that if there are “n” number of such operations in a composite operation, the value specified for the **MinPoolSize** binding property is “n+1” or greater. For more information about the **MinPoolSize** binding property, see [Configure the binding properties for Oracle Database](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-database/configure-the-binding-properties-for-oracle-database.md).
