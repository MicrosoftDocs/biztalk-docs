# Operations on Functions and Procedures with RECORD Types in Oracle Database
Oracle RECORD types are used to represent hierarchical information in parameters passed to PL/SQL functions and procedures. The [!INCLUDE[adapteroracle](../../includes/adapteroracle-md.md)] surfaces RECORD types as complex XML types. The [!INCLUDE[adapteroracle_short](../../includes/adapteroracle-short-md.md)] supports the following kinds of RECORD types:  
  
- RECORD types that are declared as TABLE%ROWTYPE parameters in stored procedures and functions.  
  
- RECORD types that are declared as TYPE of RECORD parameters in PL/SQL packages for example, TYPE rec_type1 IS RECORD(name varchar2(100), age number(3));  
  
- RECORD types that contain nested records.  
  
- RECORD types that appear as IN, OUT, or IN OUT parameters to procedures or functions.  
  
- RECORD types that are RETURN values of functions.  
  
  > [!NOTE]
  >  The [!INCLUDE[adapteroracle_short](../../includes/adapteroracle-short-md.md)] does not support BFILE types as RECORD members.  
  
  For information about:  
  
- Invoking a function or procedure involving RECORD types using the WCF service model, see [Run Operations Using RECORD Types in Oracle Database using the WCF Service Model](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-database/using-record-types-in-oracle-database-using-the-wcf-service-model.md).  
  
- Invoking a function or procedure involving RECORD types using [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], see [Invoke Functions and Procedures with RECORD Types by Using BizTalk Server](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-database/run-functions-and-procedures-with-record-types-in-oracle-db-with-biztalk-server.md).  
  
- XML structure for RECORD types as supported by the [!INCLUDE[adapteroracle_short](../../includes/adapteroracle-short-md.md)], see [Message Schemas for RECORD Types](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-database/message-schemas-for-record-types.md).
