# Get metadata for Oracle Database operations in Visual Studio
The [!INCLUDE[adapteroracle](../../includes/adapteroracle-md.md)] provides three [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] components that you can use to help you develop solutions using the adapter.  
  
- The [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservlong](../../includes/consumeadapterservlong-md.md)] and the [!INCLUDE[addadapterwiz](../../includes/addadapterwiz-md.md)] are available in BizTalk Server projects. You use the [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservshort](../../includes/consumeadapterservshort-md.md)] and the [!INCLUDE[addadapterwiz](../../includes/addadapterwiz-md.md)] to generate message schemas (XSDs) for operations that you want to target in your BizTalk solution. For more information about developing solutions with BizTalk Server, see [Develop BizTalk applications using the Oracle Database adapter](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-database/develop-biztalk-applications-using-the-oracle-database-adapter.md)  
  
- The [!INCLUDE[addadapterservreflong](../../includes/addadapterservreflong-md.md)] is available in non-BizTalk programming projects. You use the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)] to generate a WCF client class or a WCF service callback interface when you develop solutions using the WCF service model. For more information about developing solutions with the WCF service model, see [Develop Oracle Database Applications using the WCF Service Model](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-database/develop-oracle-database-applications-using-the-wcf-service-model.md).  
  
  All these three [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] components simplify development by:  
  
- Providing a Microsoft Windows interface through which you can browse and search for operations that you want to use in your solution.  
  
- Retrieving metadata exposed by the adapter for these target operations.  
  
- Converting that metadata, which is expressed as a Web Services Description Language (WSDL) document by the adapter, into a form that you can use in your solution (XSD message schemas for BizTalk projects or a .NET object representation of a service contract for the WCF service model) and adding it to your project.  
  
  This section provides instructions about how to use [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservshort](../../includes/consumeadapterservshort-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[addadapterwiz](../../includes/addadapterwiz-md.md)], and [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)].
