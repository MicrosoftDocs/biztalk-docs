# Get started with the Oracle Database adapter
This section provides an overview of the adapter, prerequisites, and topics for users who are new to Microsoft [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)]. It discusses the features of [!INCLUDE[adapteroracle](../../includes/adapteroracle-md.md)] and the different operations that can be performed on the Oracle database using the adapter.  
  
 What is an adapter? An adapter is a software component that enables you to send and receive messages to and from a line-of-business (LOB) system. The primary design goal of adapters is to facilitate the exchange of business documents between trading partners. Because each business system can adhere to specific document formats and protocols, the adapter uses a delivery mechanism that conforms to commonly recognized standards and protocols.  
  
 The adapters can be divided into two broad categories:  
  
- **LOB adapters**. Such adapters provide a service-oriented programming model to access LOB systems—for example, adapters for SAP or Siebel.  
  
- **Data adapters**. Such adapters provide a service-oriented programming model to access databases—for example, an adapter for the Oracle database or SQL Server.  
  
  There are five adapters in the [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)]:  
  
- [!INCLUDE[adaptersql](../../includes/adaptersql-md.md)] (the [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)])  
  
- [!INCLUDE[adapteroracleebusinesslong](../../includes/adapteroracleebusinesslong-md.md)] (the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)])  
  
- [!INCLUDE[adapteroracle](../../includes/adapteroracle-md.md)] (the [!INCLUDE[adapteroracle_short](../../includes/adapteroracle-short-md.md)])  
  
- [!INCLUDE[adaptersap](../../includes/adaptersap-md.md)] (the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)]), including [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersaplong](../../includes/adoprovidersaplong-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[adoprovidersapshort](../../includes/adoprovidersapshort-md.md)])  
  
- [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel](../../includes/adaptersiebel-md.md)] (the [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)]), including [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersiebellong](../../includes/adoprovidersiebellong-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[adoprovidersiebelshort](../../includes/adoprovidersiebelshort-md.md)])  
  
  > [!NOTE]
  >  The [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)] is not available for 64-bit platforms.  
  
  If you do not already know how you want to use the [!INCLUDE[adapteroracle_short](../../includes/adapteroracle-short-md.md)] at your company, it is recommended that you start by exploring the features and functionality of the adapter described in [Understanding the BizTalk Adapter for Oracle Database](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-database/understand-the-biztalk-adapter-for-oracle-database.md).
