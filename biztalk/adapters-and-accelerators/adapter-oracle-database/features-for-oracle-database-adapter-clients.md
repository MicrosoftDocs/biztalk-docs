# Features for Oracle Database adapter clients
In addition to the features discussed throughout the topics of [Overview of BizTalk Adapter for Oracle Database](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-database/overview-of-biztalk-adapter-for-oracle-database.md), the [!INCLUDE[adapteroracle_short](../../includes/adapteroracle-short-md.md)] also provides the following features that are useful for adapter clients:  
  
- **Support for configuring adapters using binding properties**. Adapter clients can configure the [!INCLUDE[adapteroracle_short](../../includes/adapteroracle-short-md.md)] by specifying certain binding properties. For example, clients can configure the adapter to use the ODP.NET connection pool by setting the **UseOracleConnectionPool** binding property. For more information, see [Configure the binding properties for Oracle Database](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-database/configure-the-binding-properties-for-oracle-database.md).  
  
- **Support for null values for operation parameters**. Adapter clients can provide null values for operation parameters using the “nil” attribute in the input XML.  
  
- **Support for dynamic ports in BizTalk**. Through the BizTalk [!INCLUDE[wcfadapter_short](../../includes/wcfadapter-short-md.md)], the [!INCLUDE[adapteroracle_short](../../includes/adapteroracle-short-md.md)] supports a dynamic port that enables dynamic routing of messages from [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] based on the message context properties. For more information, see [Configure dynamic ports](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-database/configure-dynamic-ports-in-the-oracle-database-adapter.md).  
  
- **Support for performance counters**. The [!INCLUDE[adapteroracle_short](../../includes/adapteroracle-short-md.md)] supports WCF-based performance counters for use by adapter clients. For more information about performance counters, see [Performance Counters](../../core/performance-counters.md).
