# Install the BizTalk Adapter Pack 2016
Install the [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)] in the following two ways:  
  
-   **In interactive mode**: Run the setup wizard  
  
-   **In silent mode**: Use the command line  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> - You must have administrative privileges on the computer where you install the [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)], irrespective of whether you are installing using the wizard, or the command line.  
> - Be sure all the [software prerequisites](../adapters-and-accelerators/software-prerequisites-for-biztalk-adapter-pack-2016.md) are installed before installing the [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)].

## Typical vs custom installation  
Lists the installation types, and the features that are installed with each option:  
  
-   The **Typical** and **Complete** options install all the adapters, with the associated data providers. You do not have the option of choosing a specific adapter to install.  
  
-   The **Custom** option installs one or more adapters, with the associated data providers. You can choose which adapters to install. If you choose to install a data provider, you must also install the corresponding adapter. However, you can install an adapter without installing the corresponding data provider. Do this by expanding the **ADO Providers** node, and then selecting the providers that you don't want to install. See **Install using the setup wizard** (in this topic).  
  
     For example, if you install the [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersapshort](../includes/adoprovidersapshort-md.md)], you must also install the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)]. However, you can install the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] without installing the [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersapshort](../includes/adoprovidersapshort-md.md)].  
  
## 32-bit and 64-bit install scenarios
 With [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], the [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)] can be used for: 
  
-   [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] design time (when generating metadata for operations on LOB applications)
  
-   BizTalk Server Administration console design time (for creating physical ports)
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  BizTalk Server Administration console runs as a 32-bit Microsoft Management Console (MMC) application.  
  
-   BizTalk run time (when sending and receiving messages from LOB applications)

You can use a single computer for all these taks, or use different computers. Because both [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] and BizTalk MMC are 32-bit processes, you must install the 32-bit [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)] on the computer where you complete the design-time tasks. 

### 32-bit install scenario
Install the following software on each computer. If you are using a single computer, all the software must be installed on that computer. 
 
1. Install 32-bit [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)]
2. Install 32-bit [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)].
3. Install 32-bit LOB client and other required DLLs.  
  
### 64-bit install scenarios
  
|For Visual Studio design time|For BizTalk MMC design time|For BizTalk run time|For Visual Studio design time and/or BizTalk MMC design time + BizTalk run time|

> [!NOTE]
>  On any computer where you want to do design-time tasks, using either [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] or BizTalk MMC, you must install the 32-bit [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)].  
  
## Install using the setup wizard  
Steps to install the [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)] in interactive mode.  
  
1.  Run the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] **setup.exe**.  
  
2.  Select **Install Microsoft BizTalk Adapters**. In the next window, any missing prerequisite programs are listed. If any are missing, then select the missing program, and setup installs it for you. 

    For example, select **Step 2: Install Microsoft BizTalk Adapter Pack** or **Step 3: Install Microsoft BizTalk Adapter Pack (x64)**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If you are installing the [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)] on a virtual machine, the setup wizard may display a message that it's checking for available disk space. If this message appears to hang or just sit there, then we recommend you **Install in silent mode** (in this topic).  
  
3.  On the Welcome screen, select **Next**.  
  
4.  Accept the end-user license agreement (EULA), and then select **Next**.  
  
5.  In **Choose Setup Type**:  
  
    -   To install the most common features, select **Typical**.  
  
    -   To select the adapters you want to install, select **Custom**, and then proceed to the next step.  
  
    -   To install all the features, select **Complete**.  
  
        > [!IMPORTANT]
        >  To install only the adapter that you use to interface with your enterprise application, select the **Custom** installation.  
  
6. **Required** only if you chose the Custom installation. If you chose the **Typical** or **Complete** installation, then skip this step, and go to step 7.  
  
    1.  In **Custom Setup**, expand **Base Adapters** to see the available adapters.  
  
    2.  For the adapters that you don't want, select the icon next to the adapter, and then select **Entire feature will be unavailable**.  
  
    3.  Expand **ADO Providers**, and then select the providers that you don't want to install.  
  
    4.  Select **Next**.  
  
7.  Select **Install**.  
  
8.  In **Customer Experience Improvement Program**, you can choose to enroll. If you enroll, you can share the following data with Microsoft:  
  
    -   Data related to the computer hardware on which you are installing the [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)].  
  
    -   Data related to the enterprise application versions you are using with the [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)].  
  
     [CEIP](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=144699) provides more information.

 The following steps show you how to complete a silent installation of [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)] for different components.  
  
### Silent mode steps
  
1.  Open a command prompt, and go to the [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)] root in the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] installation.  
  
2.  Run the following commands based on what you want to install:  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  To do silent installation on an x64-based platform, replace `AdaptersSetup.msi` with `AdaptersSetup64.msi` in the following commands.  
  
    -   To perform a complete installation, which installs all the adapters including the .NET Framework Data Providers, type:  
  
        ```  
        msiexec /i AdaptersSetup.msi /qn ADDLOCAL=ALL  
        ```  
  
    -   To install only the [!INCLUDE[adapteroracle_short](../includes/adapteroracle-short-md.md)], type:  
  
        ```  
        msiexec /i AdaptersSetup.msi /qn ADDLOCAL=DbFeature  
        ```  
  
    -   To install only the [!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)], type:  
  
        ```  
        msiexec /i AdaptersSetup.msi /qn ADDLOCAL=OracleEBSFeature  
        ```  
  
    -   To install only the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)], type:  
  
        ```  
        msiexec /i AdaptersSetup.msi /qn ADDLOCAL=SapBaseAdapterFeature  
        ```  
  
    -   To install the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] along with [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersapshort](../includes/adoprovidersapshort-md.md)], type:  
  
        ```  
        msiexec /i AdaptersSetup.msi /qn ADDLOCAL=SapBaseAdapterFeature,SapAdoFeature  
        ```  
  
    -   To install only the [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)], type:  
  
        ```  
        msiexec /i AdaptersSetup.msi /qn ADDLOCAL=SiebelBaseAdapterFeature  
        ```  
  
    -   To install the [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)] along with [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersiebelshort](../includes/adoprovidersiebelshort-md.md)], type:  
  
        ```  
        msiexec /i AdaptersSetup.msi /qn ADDLOCAL=SiebelBaseAdapterFeature,SiebelAdoFeature  
        ```  
  
    -   To install only the [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)], type:  
  
        ```  
        msiexec /i AdaptersSetup.msi /qn ADDLOCAL=SqlFeature  
        ```  
  
    -   To install all the base adapters, type:  
  
        ```  
        msiexec /i AdaptersSetup.msi /qn ADDLOCAL=SapBaseAdapterFeature,SiebelBaseAdapterFeature,DbFeature,OracleEBSFeature,SqlFeature  
        ```  
  
    -   To install the two .NET Framework Data Providers, type:  
  
        ```  
        msiexec /i AdaptersSetup.msi /qn ADDLOCAL=SapAdoFeature,SiebelAdoFeature  
        ```  
  
    -   Any type of custom installation by separating the components by a comma. For example, to install the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)] with the [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersapshort](../includes/adoprovidersapshort-md.md)], and the [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)] type:  
  
        ```  
        msiexec /i AdaptersSetup.msi /qn ADDLOCAL=SapBaseAdapterFeature,SapAdoFeature,SiebelBaseAdapterFeature  
        ```  
  
    -   You can also opt to enroll for CEIP as part of the silent installation. Type:  
  
        ```  
        msiexec /i AdaptersSetup.msi /qn CEIP_OPTIN=true  
        ```  
  
         By default the option is false. 
  
        > [!IMPORTANT]
        >  While installing the [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)] Evaluation version in silent mode, the default option for CEIP is true.  
  
     For more information about the **msiexec** command, type `msiexec` on the command line, and press `ENTER`. Or go to [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=103199](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=103199).
     
## Known install issue
For a comprehensive list of installation-related issues, refer to **Troubleshooting** topics for each adapter.  
  
**Running setup on a 64-bit computer may throw an error while accessing schema file**  
  
The [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)] setup throws an error while accessing the Microsoft.Adapters.*\<AdapterName\>*_schema.xml file, but proceeds with the adapter installation.  
  
**Cause**  
  
If both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)] are installed on the same computer, the target schema file used by both is the same. As a result, the file installed by the 32-bit [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)] might be in use by IIS when the 64-bit installer tries to access it.  
  
**Resolution**  
  
Manually copy the Microsoft.Adapters.*\<AdapterName\>*_schema.xml file from *C:\Program Files\Microsoft BizTalk Adapter Pack(x64)\IIS Schemas* to *C:\Windows\System32\inetsrv\config\schema*.
