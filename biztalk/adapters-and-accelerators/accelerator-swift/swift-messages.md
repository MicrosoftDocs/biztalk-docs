# SWIFT Messages
Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) is an industry-owned cooperative supplying secure messaging services and interface software to over 7,000 financial institutions in 200 countries/regions. SWIFT provides messaging services to banks, broker-dealers, and investment managers, as well as to market infrastructures in payments, treasury, securities, and trade. These services help their customers reduce costs, improve automation, and manage risk. SWIFT is also the main standards body for interbank communications.  
  
 You can access the SWIFT Web site at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=27885](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=27885).  
  
 Microsoft [!INCLUDE[A4SWIFT_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/a4swift-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] provides schema and validation support for the SWIFT financial (FIN) messages listed in the [Supported Messages](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/supported-messages.md) topic, based on the SWIFT Standards Release Guide \<version> (SRG\<version>).  
  
 **Message Copies**  
  
 A4SWIFT stores copies of the message before and after transformation. These copies are accessible through the BizTalk Admin console.
