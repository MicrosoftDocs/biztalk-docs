# Creating an A4SWIFT Receive Location
You must create an [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] receive location to enable message reception from the SWIFT network by [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)], as shown in the following figure. The receive location receives flat file messages from an inbound file folder.  
  
 ![](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/media/a4swift-receive-location-configuration.gif "A4SWIFT_Receive_Location_Configuration")  
  
 **Summary**  
  
 Create and bind a one-way receive port, and then create and enable a receive location with the following properties and components:  
  
|Property/Components|Setting|  
|--------------------------|-------------|  
|Receive port|One-way port|  
|Transport type|FILE|  
|Address URI|Name of the folder that you want to receive the message|  
|File mask|\*.*\<extension\>*, where \<*extension*\> is the extension of the incoming flat file message|  
|Receive handler|BizTalkServerApplication|  
|Receive pipeline|The [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] receive pipeline that you created|  
  
### To add the receive port and location  
  
1.  Start **BizTalk Server Administration** console.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  The BizTalk Server Administration Console can also be opened from within Visual Studio by clicking **BizTalk Server Administration** in the **Tools** menu.  
  
2.  In Administration Console, expand **BizTalk Server Administration**, expand **BizTalk Group**, expand **Applications**, and then expand **BizTalk Application 1**.  
  
3.  Right-click **Receive Ports**, point to **New**, and then click **One-Way Receive Port**.  
  
4.  In the Receive Port Properties dialog box, in the **Name** box, type a name for the receive port.  
  
5.  Click **Apply** to bind the port, and then click **OK**.  
  
6.  Right-click **Receive Locations**, point to **New**, and then click **One-way Receive Location**.  
  
7.  In the Select a Receive Port dialog box, click the receive port that you just created, and then click **OK**.  
  
8.  In the Receive Location Properties dialog box, in the **Name** box, type a name for the receive location.  
  
9. In the **Transport** section, for the **Type** text box, click the drop-down list, and then select **FILE**.  
  
10. Click the **Configure** button to the right of the Type drop-down list.  
  
11. In the FILE Transport Properties dialog box, click **Browse**. Move to the folder that you want to receive the message. Click **OK**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If this folder does not exist, you can create it using the **Make New Folder** command.  
  
12. In the FILE Transport Properties dialog box, in the **File Mask** box, enter **\*.\<*extension*\>**, where \<*extension*\> is the extension of the incoming flat file message, such as **.txt**. Click **OK**.  
  
13. In the Receive Location Properties dialog box, ensure that **BizTalkServerApplication** is entered for the **Receive handler** box.  
  
14. For the **Receive Pipeline** box, select your custom receive pipeline from the drop-down list.  
  
15. Click **Apply**, and then click **OK**.  
  
16. In the BizTalk Server Administration Console, click **Receive Locations**, right-click the receive location that you just created, and then click **Enable**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  After you enable the receive location, BizTalk actively polls your file folder.
