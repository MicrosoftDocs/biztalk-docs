# Defining a Custom BAM View for Message Repair and New Submission Data
[!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] Setup provides a BAM definition file that defines a business activity and a business view. You can deploy the BAM definition file to use that view, or you can create a custom view that you can add to the BAM definition file.  

 The BAM definition file is MrsrActivities.xml in *\<drive\>*:\Program Files\Microsoft BizTalk Accelerator for SWIFT\BAMTracking. It defines a Message activity and a RepairView view. For more information about deploying MrsrActivities.xml by using the bm deploy utility, see BizTalk Server Help.  

 Create the custom view in the Business Activity Monitoring View Wizard from the BAM workbook. For more information about creating a custom view, see "Creating a BAM View" in [!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)]BizTalk Server Information Worker Help.  

 The Message activity in MrsrActivities.xml includes the following items that you can add to the custom view:  

> [!NOTE]
>  When durations are calculated in BAM, they are measured in units of one day (14.4 minutes = .01 day).
