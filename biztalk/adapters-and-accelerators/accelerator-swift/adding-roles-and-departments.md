# Adding Roles and Departments
After you create [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] users who will create, repair, verify, and/or approve messages, you must create one or more departments with roles to establish the create/repair workflow.  
  
 When a message is sent to repair, [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] assigns a department to repair the message. [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] uses business rules to determine which department should repair which message. You can configure the business rules to execute department workflows based upon message type or other data. For more information about setting the department workflows, see [Creating Departments and Roles for Message Repair and New Submission](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/creating-departments-and-roles-for-message-repair-and-new-submission.md).
