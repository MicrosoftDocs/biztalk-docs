# Changing Fields to Be Rekeyed
In the verification step of a message repair workflow, [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] removes the data from a number of fields so that the verifier must re-enter, or rekey, that data. You can customize which fields in the RekeyVerify [!INCLUDE[btsInpathNoVersion](../../includes/btsinpathnoversion-md.md)] form need to be rekeyed. You do so in the MrsrXpathConfig.xml file, which is located in the \<*drive*\>:\Program Files\Microsoft BizTalk Accelerator for SWIFT\MRSR folder.  
  
 The MrsrXpathConfig.xml file contains a series of nodes for the message type processed. Each message-type node contains a series of field nodes, one for each field. You can change the fields to be rekeyed by opening MrsrXpathConfig.xml in a text editor, such as Notepad, and adding or removing a \<path\> node for the field.  
  
 The \<path\> node contains paths for the message type and the field. For example, the entry for the Destination Path in the Input Application Header Block of an MT103 message is the following:  
  
```  
<path>/*[local-name()='SWIFT_CATEGORY1_MT103_Interchange' and namespace-uri()'http://schemas.microsoft.com/BizTalk/Solutions/FinancialServices/SWIFT/Category1/MT103']/*[local-name()='SWIFTHeader' and namespace-uri=']'']/*[local-name()='ApplicationHeaderBlock_Input' and namespace-uri90='']/*[local-name()='DestinationAddress' and namespace-uri()='']</path>  
```  
  
 It is easiest to add a new field to be rekeyed by copying and then pasting an existing entry, and then changing the relevant paths. For example, to force rekey of the Date field in the Value Date Currency Interbank Settled Amount 32A section of an MT103 message, make the following three replacements to the preceding code. The rest of the code remains the same.  
  
|Replace this|With this|  
|------------------|---------------|  
|`SWIFTHeader`|`SWIFT_CATEGORY1_MT103`|  
|`ApplicationHeaderBlock_Input`|`ValueDateCurrencyInterbankSettledAmount_32A`|  
|`DestinationAddress`|`Date`|
