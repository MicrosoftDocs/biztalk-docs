# Lesson 1: Adding XML Receive Port and Location
A receive port is a logical grouping of similar receive locations. A receive location defines a specific address (such as a URL or file location) for an incoming message and the pipeline that is used to process the message.  
  
### To add a receive port  
  
1.  Start **BizTalk Server Administration** console.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  The BizTalk Server Administration Console can also be opened from within Visual Studio by clicking **BizTalk Server Administration** in the **Tools** menu.  
  
2.  In the BizTalk Server Administration Console, expand the **BizTalk Server Administration** node, then the **BizTalk Group** node, then the **Applications** node, and then the **BizTalk Application 1** node.  
  
3.  Right-click **Receive Ports**, point to **New**, and then click **One-Way Receive Port**.  
  
4.  In the Receive Port Properties dialog box, in the **Name** box, type **MT103_XML_ReceivePort**.  
  
5.  Click **Apply** to bind the port, and then click **OK.**  
  
6.  Right-click **Receive Locations**, point to **New**, and then click **One-way Receive Location**.  
  
7.  In the Select a Receive Port dialog box, click **MT103_XML_ReceivePort**, and then click **OK**.  
  
8.  In the Receive Location Properties dialog box, in the **Name** box, type **MT103_XML_ReceiveLocation**.  
  
9. In the **Transport** section, for the **Type** text box, click the drop-down list, and then select **FILE**.  
  
10. Click the **Configure** button to the right of the Type drop-down list.  
  
11. In the FILE Transport Properties dialog box, click **Browse**. Move to the **\<drive\>:\Labs** folder, and then click **Make New Folder**.  
  
12. In the Browse For Folder dialog box, create an **Inbound** folder in **\<drive\>:\Labs**, and then create an **XMLFile** folder in **\<drive\>:\Labs\Inbound**. Click **OK**.  
  
13. In the FILE Transport Properties dialog box, ensure that **\*.xml** is entered in the **File Mask** box, and then click **OK**.  
  
14. In the Receive Location Properties dialog box, ensure that **BizTalkServerApplication** is entered for the **Receive handler** box.  
  
15. For the **Receive Pipeline** box, select **XMLReceive** from the drop-down list.  
  
16. Click **Apply**, and then click **OK**.  
  
17. In the BizTalk Server Administration Console, click **Receive Locations**, right-click **MT103_XML_ReceiveLocation**, and then click **Enable**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  After you enable the receive location, BizTalk actively polls your file folder.
