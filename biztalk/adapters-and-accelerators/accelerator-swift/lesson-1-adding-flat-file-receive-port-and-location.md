# Lesson 1: Adding Flat File Receive Port and Location
The receive port always has an associated receive location that you must configure when you add the receive port. A receive location defines a specific address for an incoming message and the pipeline that you use to process the message.  
  
### To add a receive port  
  
1.  In the BizTalk Server Administration Console, right-click **Receive Ports**, point to **New**, and then click **One-way Receive Port**.  
  
2.  In the Receive Port Properties dialog box, in the **Name** box, type **MT103_FlatFile_ReceivePort**.  
  
3.  Click **Apply** to bind the port, and then click **OK**.  
  
4.  In the BizTalk Server Administration Console, right-click **Receive Locations**, point to **New**, and then click **One-way Receive Location**.  
  
5.  In the Select a Receive Port dialog box, click **MT103_FlatFile_ReceivePort**, and then click **OK**.  
  
6.  In the Receive Location Properties dialog box, in the **Name** box, type **MT103_FlatFile_ReceiveLocation**.  
  
7.  In the **Transport** section, for the **Type** text box, click the drop-down list, and then select **FILE**.  
  
8.  Click the **Configure** button to the right of the Type drop-down list.  
  
9. In the FILE Transport Properties dialog box, click **Browse**.  
  
10. In the Browse For Folder dialog box, move to the **\<drive\>:\Labs\Inbound** folder, and then click **Make New Folder**.  
  
11. Create a **FlatFile** folder in **\<drive\>:\Labs\Inbound**, and then click **OK**.  
  
12. In the **File mask** box, type **\*.txt**, and then click **OK**.  
  
13. In the Receive Location Properties dialog box, ensure that **BizTalkServerApplication** is entered for the **Receive handler** box.  
  
14. For the **Receive Pipeline** box, select **MT103ReceivePipeline** from the drop-down list.  
  
15. Click **Apply**, and then click **OK**.  
  
16. In the BizTalk Server Administration Console, click **Receive Locations**, right-click **MT103_FlatFile_ReceiveLocation**, and then click **Enable**.
