# Working with the SWIFT Disassembler and Assembler
Microsoft [!INCLUDE[A4SWIFT_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/a4swift-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] provides custom pipeline components, the SWIFT disassembler, and SWIFT assembler that have features designed specifically for processing SWIFT flat-file messages. The [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] send and receive pipelines use the A4SWIFT pipeline components to perform specific tasks during defined stages of inbound (receive) and outbound (send) processing. For further details about message processing, pipelines, and pipeline components, see BizTalk Server Help.
