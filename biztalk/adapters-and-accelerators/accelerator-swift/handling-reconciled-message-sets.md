# Handling Reconciled Message Sets
When SAA returns a response to [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] records the response in the MessageBox, and matches the response or responses to the original message. You can implement custom application behavior using this information. To do so, develop custom handlers that implement customer-specific reactions to reconciled message/response sets. You can create custom handlers that do the following:  

- Process messages that FRR has correlated with a MTS21_FIN_ACKNAK negative-acknowledgment message, which indicates that SWIFT did not successfully receive the message from [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)]. This can enable a repairer to fix the message and re-send it to SAA and the SWIFT network, which after the repair will hopefully be able to receive the message successfully. For more information about this solution, see [FRR NAK Handler Sample](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/frr-nak-handler-sample.md).  

- Drop message-response sets published by the orchestration into a file folder with unique file names indicating the relationships of the messages in the set. You can then perform business logic on these messages.  

- Process timed-out messages.  

- Log the results of message transmission and then discard the actual messages.
