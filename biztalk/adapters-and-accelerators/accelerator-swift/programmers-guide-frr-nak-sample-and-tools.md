# Programmers guide, FRR NAK sample, and tools

## Overiview
This Software Development Kit (SDK) provides information for developers who are creating applications using any of the tools in Microsoft® [!INCLUDE[A4SWIFT_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/a4swift-currentversion-firstref-md.md)], the public application programming interfaces (API), or the samples and utilities provided in the A4SWIFT SDK.  
  
#### Tips for using Help in a developer environment
  
 A4SWIFT Help contains features that you can use to display the developer documentation in your preferred language and to link between A4SWIFT Help and Visual Studio Help.  
  
#### Multiple languages
  
 The A4SWIFT .NET Class Reference provides signatures and code examples in multiple programming languages. The following tags denote the language-specific information:

 [C++]  
  
 [JScript]  
  

 When a member is inherited from the .NET Framework Base Class Library, two links are provided, as shown in the following example:
