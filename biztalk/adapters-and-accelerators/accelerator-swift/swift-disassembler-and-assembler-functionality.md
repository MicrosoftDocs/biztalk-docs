# SWIFT Disassembler and Assembler Functionality
The SWIFT disassembler can perform the following tasks when invoked in a [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] receive pipeline:  
  
- Dynamically discover the message type and resolve document schema. This enables a single receive port and pipeline to handle multiple SWIFT message types.  
  
- Parse a SWIFT flat file into XML.  
  
- Invoke the XML validating reader to perform XML (schema) validation, such as checking data type validity, data format, or length conformance.  
  
- Invoke the Business Rule Engine (BRE) to perform BRE validation, such as checking conformance to SWIFT network rules or performing other complex validation that the schema does not implement.  
  
- Publish a parsed XML message to the MessageBox database with promoted context properties and serialized error collection XML (providing information about any errors encountered during parsing or validation).  
  
  > [!NOTE]
  >  If the disassembler encounters fatal failures during parsing, the disassembler will publish the message to the MessageBox database in native flat file format rather than XML.  
  
- Process inbound batches, as follows:  
  
  -   Parse and preserve batch envelopes (batch header, batch trailer)  
  
  -   Parse and preserve message envelopes (message header, message trailer)  
  
  -   Parse and validate SWIFT messages in the batch individually  
  
  -   Publish SWIFT messages to the MessageBox database individually  
  
  -   Publish the entire inbound batch to the MessageBox database as a single message (exact copy of input)  
  
  -   Promote batch-related context properties for sorting or correlating messages originating from the same batch  
  
  The SWIFT assembler can perform the following tasks when invoked in a BizTalk send pipeline:  
  
- Dynamically discover the message type and resolve the document schema. This allows a single send port and pipeline to handle multiple SWIFT message types.  
  
- Serialize parsed XML into a SWIFT flat file.
