# Lesson 4: Adding the SWIFT Assembler and Disassembler to the Toolbox
In this lesson, you add references to the SWIFT assembler (ASM) and disassembler (DASM) so that these components are available in the toolbox when using BizTalk Pipeline Designer.  
  
### To add the SWIFT ASM and DASM components to the toolbox  
  
1. In Visual Studio, on the **Tools** menu, click **Choose Toolbox Items**.  
  
2. In the Choose Toolbox Items dialog box, on the **BizTalk Pipeline Components** tab, select **SWIFT Assembler** and **SWIFT Disassembler**.  
  
3. Click **OK**.  
  
   The assembler and disassembler components are now available from the toolbox, unless you already have a receive or a send pipeline open, in which case the ASM or DASM may be unavailable.  
  
   Proceed to [Lesson 5: Adding the SWIFT Disassembler to a Custom Receive Pipeline](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/lesson-5-adding-the-swift-disassembler-to-a-custom-receive-pipeline.md).
