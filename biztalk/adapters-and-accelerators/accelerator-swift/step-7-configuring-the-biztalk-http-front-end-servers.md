# Step 7: Configuring the BizTalk HTTP Front-End Servers
This section provides guidelines on configuring the Web servers in your [!INCLUDE[A4SWIFT_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/a4swift-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] deployment.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  In the single-computer deployment, this computer is the same computer as the one that does the messaging and processing.  
  
### To configure the BizTalk HTTP front-end servers  
  
1. Install Internet Information Services (IIS) and ASP.NET.  
  
2. Open IIS Manager and select **Web Service Extensions**. Ensure that ASP.NET v1.1 and ASP.NET v2.0 are set to **Allowed**.  
  
3. Ensure that the **Message Queuing** service (MSMQ) with **Routing Support** is installed from the Add/Remove [!INCLUDE[btsWinNoVersion](../../includes/btswinnoversion-md.md)] Components under Application Server/Message Queuing.  
  
4. Ensure that Network DTC access is enabled in the Add/Remove [!INCLUDE[btsWinNoVersion](../../includes/btswinnoversion-md.md)] Components under the Application Server category. Network DTC client access was enabled on the [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] computer in an earlier step.  
  
5. Implement the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol in your deployment, as described in [Supporting Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/supporting-secure-sockets-layer-ssl.md).  
  
6. Install and configure Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 SP1.  
  
7. Install and configure [!INCLUDE[A4SWIFT_CurrentVersion_abbrev](../../includes/a4swift-currentversion-abbrev-md.md)] as described in [Installing and Configuring BizTalk Accelerator for SWIFT on HTTP Front-End Servers](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/installing-and-configuring-biztalk-server-on-the-http-front-end-servers.md).
