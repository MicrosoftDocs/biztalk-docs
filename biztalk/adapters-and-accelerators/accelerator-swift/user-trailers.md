# User Trailers
User trailers, except for the CHK trailer, are optional and when present, occur in the following order:  
  
|Trailer code|Name|  
|------------------|----------|  
|MAC|Message Authentication Code|  
|PAC|Proprietary Authentication Code|  
|CHK|Checksum|  
|TNG|Training|  
|PDE|Possible Duplicate Emission|  
  
-   **Message Authentication Code (MAC) Trailer.** Allows authentication by the receiving user. The MAC trailer is followed by an authentication result. This trailer is mandatory for most user-to-user message categories within the FIN application.  
  
     When the FIN Copy Service is used, a PAC trailer (if present) follows the MAC trailer. The following code is an example of a MAC trailer:  
  
    ```  
    {MAC:<authentication-result>}  
    where <authentication-result> = 8!h  
    ```  
  
-   **Proprietary Authentication Code (PAC) Trailer.** The PAC trailer is used within the FIN Copy service only when using the double authentication option. Block 5 of FIN user-to-user messages include the PAC trailer immediately after the MAC trailer, if present. This result is calculated on the extracted fields of Block 4 of the message, the value of field 115, if present, and the \<authentication-result\> of the MAC trailer for Copy Services with double authentication.  
  
     As a result, the end-of-block indicator (CrLf-) is included in the PAC calculation and the fields are defined as follows:  
  
    -   The first four characters are CrLf:  
  
    -   The field and the delimiter are present, that is, 32A:, 20:, and so on.  
  
    -   All subfields and their delimiters are present.  
  
     The following code is an example of the PAC trailer format:  
  
    ```  
    {PAC:[<authentication-result>]}  
    where <authentication-result> is mandatory on input messages only and  
    <authentication-result> = 8!h  
    ```  
  
-   **CHK (Checksum) Trailer (mandatory for all FIN messages)**  
  
     The CHK trailer is mandatory for all FIN messages and is computed based upon the receiver's address (12 characters with the ninth character replaced by *X* plus the text block). This trailer allows the system and the CBT to check that messages are not corrupted due to a system malfunction or an undetected transmission error.  
  
     The following code is an example of the CHK trailer format:  
  
    ```  
    {CHK:<checksum-result>}  
    where <checksum-result> = 12!h  
    ```
