# Lesson 1: Submitting a Sample Flat File
You submit a sample flat file to test your solution.  
  
### To submit a sample MT103 flat file  
  
1. Copy the MT103_Sample.txt file from \<*drive*\>:\Program Files\Microsoft BizTalk Accelerator for SWIFT\SDK\Tutorial to \<*drive*\>:\Labs\Inbound\FlatFile folder.  
  
2. Verify that after a moment, the MT103_Sample.txt file disappears from the folder.  
  
3. Browse to the \<*drive*\>:\Labs\Outbound folder. Verify that the folder contains a file called {GUID}.xml.  
  
4. Right-click the file {GUID}.xml, point to **Open With**, and then click **Notepad**. Do the same for the file called MT103_Sample.txt from \<*drive*\>:\Program Files\Microsoft BizTalk Accelerator for SWIFT\SDK\Tutorial. Verify that the content within the tags of the XML file is the same as the content in the flat file.  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   >  Do not delete the resulting file; you will use it in a later lesson.
