# Module 7: Testing a Valid Flat File Instance
In this module, you submit a valid sample MT103 flat file to the file receive ports created in the previous labs. This task tests the receive pipelines you created in previous labs. [!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[A4SWIFT_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/a4swift-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] writes the output in XML format to the output folder in the send port you selected in the previous lesson, [Lesson 2: Adding an XML Send Port](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/lesson-2-adding-an-xml-send-port.md).  
  
 You initiate the file receive adapter by copying a SWIFT flat-formatted file to the inbound folder. This action results in [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] routing a valid SWIFT XML file to the outbound folder.  
  
 In this task, you also submit an MT103 message that is not valid. You use the Event to resolve the error.
