# Configuring FIN Response Reconciliation
You must perform the steps in the following sections to configure the Microsoft [!INCLUDE[A4SWIFT_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/a4swift-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] FIN Response Reconciliation (FRR) feature, as shown in the following figure.  
  
 ![Image that shows the flow for the FIN Response Reconciliation (FRR) feature.](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/media/a4swift-frr-configuration.jpg "A4SWIFT_FRR_Configuration")  
  
 In the A4SWIFT Installation Wizard, you can choose to install Message Repair and New Submission and FRR, or Message Repair and New Submission without FRR, or FRR without Message Repair and New Submission. As a result, the instructions in this section do not assume that you are installing and configuring Message Repair and New Submission. They do, however, assume that you have performed the steps in the [Configuring the A4SWIFT Runtime](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/configuring-the-a4swift-runtime.md).  
  
 This section contains:
