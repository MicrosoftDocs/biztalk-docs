# Configuring Message Repair and New Submission
You must perform the steps in the following sections to configure the Message Repair and New Submission feature of Microsoft [!INCLUDE[A4SWIFT_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/a4swift-currentversion-firstref-md.md)], as shown in the following figure.  
  
 ![Image that shows the Message Repair and New Submission feature.](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/media/a4swift-message-repair-configuration.gif "A4SWIFT_Message_Repair_Configuration")  
  
 In the A4SWIFT Installation Wizard, you can choose to install Message Repair and New Submission and FIN Response Reconciliation (FRR), or Message Repair and New Submission without FRR, or FRR without Message Repair and New Submission. As a result, the instructions in this section do not assume that you are installing and configuring FRR. They do, however, assume that you have performed the steps in the [A4SWIFT Component Configuration Guide](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/a4swift-component-configuration-guide.md) section.
