# Security Enhancements
Each step of this deployment guide has been designed as a secure deployment for your [!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[A4SWIFT_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/a4swift-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] installation.  
  
 For more information about A4SWIFT security, see [Security and privacy standards](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/security-and-privacy-standards.md).
  
 For more information about securing a [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] deployment, see [Planning for Security](../../core/planning-for-security.md). [Security Recommendations for a BizTalk Server Deployment](../../core/security-recommendations-for-a-biztalk-server-deployment.md) contains specific security recommendations.
