# Installing Certificates
To send, repair, or submit messages, you must have the proper certificates installed. This topic describes how to add certificates. In a production environment, see your IT department for certificates.  

 **Summary**  

 This section provides instructions on how to create and store the following certificates:  

- Certificates for each of the Message Repair and New Submission roles in the Personal folder of the Certificates - Current User store on each client computer  

- Certificates for each of the Message Repair and New Submission roles in the Other People folder of the Certificates (Local Computer) store on each BizTalk orchestration server computer  

- Certification Authority's certificate into the Trusted Root Certification Authorities folder in the Certificates (Local Computer) store on each client computer  

  If you have deployed [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] on a single computer, and also have a certificate server installed on the same computer, you need to exclude the certificate server from the managed paths for Microsoft SharePoint Server.
