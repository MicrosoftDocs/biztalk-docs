# Adding A4SWIFT Users and Updating Windows Groups
After you create and install certificates for Message Repair and New Submission roles, you must create [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] users and add [!INCLUDE[btsWinNoVersion](../../includes/btswinnoversion-md.md)] users to groups.  
  
 **Summary**  
  
 Create Message Repair and New Submission users and add local or domain accounts to [!INCLUDE[btsWinNoVersion](../../includes/btswinnoversion-md.md)] user groups, as follows:  
  
- In the [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] Management Console, you need to create as many users as there are roles in the workflow stages of your Message Repair and New Submission process. Associate a distinct certificate with each of these users.  
  
- Using the [!INCLUDE[btsWinNoVersion](../../includes/btswinnoversion-md.md)] Computer Management utility, add each local user who is creating, repairing, verifying, or approving a message to the A4SWIFT Users.  
  
- Using the [!INCLUDE[btsWinNoVersion](../../includes/btswinnoversion-md.md)] Computer Management utility, add the local user that is listed in the Log On As field for the BizTalk Service BizTalk Group service to the [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] Users group.  
  
  > [!NOTE]
  >  For more information about [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] users and roles, see [Creating Departments and Roles for Message Repair and New Submission](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/creating-departments-and-roles-for-message-repair-and-new-submission.md).
