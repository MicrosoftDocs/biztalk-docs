> [!TIP]
> The hardware requirements listed are the minimum. Every environment is different and there's a very good chance that your environment may need more. See [Recommendations for Installing, Sizing, Deploying, and Maintaining a BizTalk Server Solution](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/666.recommendations-for-installing-sizing-deploying-and-maintaining-a-biztalk-server-solution.aspx).

## Install SWIFT

### Before you begin

* Sign in using an account that is a member of the BizTalk Server Administrators group.
* In your BizTalk Server download, the [!INCLUDE[A4SWIFT_CurrentVersion_abbrev_md](../../includes/a4swift-currentversion-abbrev-md.md)] setup is in the `\BizTalk Accelerators` folder.
* BizTalk Server must be installed, and SQL Server must be running.
* A silent installation is supported, but is not recommended due to the complexity of the additional configuration steps that are required.
* The A4SWIFT setup always runs with the `/InstallPlatform` argument. As a result, the setup always installs msvcr71.dll, mfc71u.dll, msvcp71.dll, and atl71.dll, which are required for Visual Studio. The setup installs these DLL files into the `%WINDIR%\System32` folder, whether the DLLs have been previously installed or not.

### Default installation

1. Run the [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFTNoVersion_md](../../includes/btaa4swiftnoversion-md.md)] **setup.exe** as Administrator.
2. Select **Install**.
3. Enter your **User name**, your **Organization**, and your product key. Select **Next**.
4. Read the licensing agreement, and then select **Accept**.
5. Select **Complete**, and then select **Next**.
6. Review the **Summary** page. To make any changes, select **Back**.

    To enable auto-logon after a system reboot, select **Set**, and enter the sign-in account. This is only enabled during the setup. When setup is complete, this setting is disabled.

    Select **Install**.

7. Select **Finish** when complete. A setup log file is generated in a temp folder, similar to: `C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Setup(111016 xxxxxx).log`.

> [!NOTE]
> If **Run Configuration Wizard** is selected on the Installation Completed page, the [!INCLUDE[A4SWIFT_CurrentVersion_abbrev_md](../../includes/a4swift-currentversion-abbrev-md.md)] Configuration Wizard runs automatically when you click **Finish**.


### Custom installation

1. Run the [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFTNoVersion_md](../../includes/btaa4swiftnoversion-md.md)] **setup.exe** as Administrator.
2. Select **Install**.
3. Enter your **User name**, your **Organization**, and your product key. Select **Next**.
4. Read the licensing agreement, and then select **Accept**.
5. Select **Custom**, and then select **Next**.
6. Select your components, and then select **Next**:
