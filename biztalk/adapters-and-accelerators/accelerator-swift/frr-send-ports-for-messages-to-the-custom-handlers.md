# FRR Send Ports for Messages to the Custom Handlers
To enable custom handlers for FRR, you must create a series of FRR send ports, each one of which routes a copy of an original message of a certain type to the custom handlers. These send ports must have the following pipeline components:  

- The SWIFT assembler in the Assemble stage  

- The SWIFTSendFrrComponent pipeline component in the Encode stage  

  For all messages except Category 0 to 9 SWIFT FIN messages that are not successfully sent, the send port must have the following filters:  

- [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)]_SendingServiceType == [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)]_FrrService  

- BTS.Operation set to the value required for each message type. For the possible values for the BTS.Operation property, see the table in [Creating the FRR Send Ports for Sending to the Custom Handlers](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/creating-the-frr-send-ports-for-sending-to-the-custom-handlers.md).  

  For Category 0 to 9 SWIFT FIN messages that are not successfully sent, the send port must have the following filters:  

- [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)]_SendingServiceTyp==[!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)]_FrrService  

- [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)]_FrrFailed==True  

- BTS.Operation==[!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)]_FrrSendMTMsg  

- [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)]_FRRFailedReason set to the value required for each message type. For the possible values for the BTS.Operation property, see the table in [Creating the FRR Send Ports for Sending to the Custom Handlers](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/creating-the-frr-send-ports-for-sending-to-the-custom-handlers.md).
