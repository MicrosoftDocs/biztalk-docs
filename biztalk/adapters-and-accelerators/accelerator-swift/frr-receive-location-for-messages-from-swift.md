# FRR Receive Location for Messages from SWIFT
To enable FIN response reconciliation (FRR), you must set up an FRR receive pipeline component to receive a message from SAA and prepare it for processing by [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)]. The receive pipeline contains the following components:  
  
-   The SWIFT disassembler in the Disassemble stage  
  
-   The SWIFT FRR Decoder pipeline component in the Decoder stage  
  
-   The SWIFT FRR CorrelationSet Resolver pipeline component in the Party Resolution stage  
  
 When [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] receives a PAN/NAN, SWIFT FRR Decoder reads the MQ Feedback context property to determine whether the response is a PAN or a NAN. It sets the transport-agnostic [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)]_FRRTransportLevelAck Boolean values to true for a PAN or false for a NAN.  
  
 The SWIFT FRR CorrelationSet Resolver pipeline component overwrites the response message's FRRCorrelationToken property, which the FRR orchestration uses, with the value in the MQMD.CorrelId property.
