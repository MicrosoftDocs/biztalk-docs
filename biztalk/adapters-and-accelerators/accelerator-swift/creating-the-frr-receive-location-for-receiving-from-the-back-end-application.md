# Creating the FRR Receive Location for Receiving from the Back-End Application
To perform FIN Response Reconciliation, you need to create a receive location that receives a message from the back-end application into [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)].  

 **Summary**  

 Create a receive location with the following properties and components:  


| Property/Component |                                                                 Setting                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    Receive port    |                                                              One-way port                                                               |
|   Transport type   |                                           The transport type used by the back-end application                                           |
|    Address URI     |                                                   As required for the transport type                                                    |
|  Receive handler   |                                                        BizTalkServerApplication                                                         |
|  Receive pipeline  | The [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] receive pipeline that you created for FRR |
