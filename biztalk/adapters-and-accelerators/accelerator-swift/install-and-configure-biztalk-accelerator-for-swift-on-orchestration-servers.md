# Installing and Configuring BizTalk Accelerator for SWIFT on Orchestration Servers
This section describes how to install and configure [!INCLUDE[A4SWIFT_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/a4swift-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] on the orchestration servers. These servers are mainly used to run the FIN Repair and Reconciliation orchestration and the Message Repair/New Submission orchestration.  
  
### To install and configure BizTalk Accelerator for SWIFT on the orchestration server  
  
1.  Perform a Custom Install of [!INCLUDE[A4SWIFT_CurrentVersion_abbrev](../../includes/a4swift-currentversion-abbrev-md.md)]. Install the **MRSR** feature.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  You do not need to install the Web Components for Message Repair and New Submission feature because this server does not have MRSR site.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  After installation is complete, the Configuration Wizard starts.  
  
2.  In the Microsoft [!INCLUDE[A4SWIFT_CurrentVersion_abbrev](../../includes/a4swift-currentversion-abbrev-md.md)] Configuration console, configure **MCRR**.
