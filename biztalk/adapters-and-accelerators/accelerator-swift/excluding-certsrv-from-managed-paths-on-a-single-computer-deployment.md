2.  In the Central Administration window, in the **Virtual Server Configuration** section, click **Configure virtual server settings**.  
  
3.  In the Virtual Server List window, click **Default Web Site**.  
  
4.  In the Virtual Server Settings window, in the **Virtual Server Management** section, click **Define managed paths**.
