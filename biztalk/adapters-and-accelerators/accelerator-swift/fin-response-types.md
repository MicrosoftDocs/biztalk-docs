# FIN Response Types
FIN Response Reconciliation (FRR) reconciles responses to any Category 0 to 9 SWIFT FIN message. In response to one of these FIN messages, the SWIFT FIN application always sends at least one, and possibly more than one, acknowledgment (ACK) or negative acknowledgment (NAK). The following table shows the message types of the outbound and inbound (response) messages processed by FRR.  


| Outbound/<br /><br /> inbound |                                             Message type                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Message status                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

This message covers both of these cases. Whether it is an ACK or a NAK is determined by the value in the 451 field of the message ("0" for ACK and "1" for NAK). This will be the first response delivered back to [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)]. |

## Deployment of Schemas for FRR  
 [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] setup deploys schemas in FrrSchemas.dll for all system-level messages (as shown in the table above). The FRR orchestration requires these schemas to be deployed. Because [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] setup deploys these schemas in FrrSchemas.dll, you do not have to, and must not, deploy these schemas in another project. Doing so will generate an error.  

 FRRSchemas.dll includes the following schemas:  

-   TransportAck  

-   MT010  

-   MT011  

-   MT012  

-   MT015  

-   MT019  

-   MTS21_FIN_ACKNAK
