# Operational tasks
[!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[A4SWIFT_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/a4swift-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] encompasses one or more servers and a series of tools for enterprise application integration (EAI), automating financial business processes, and facilitating message exchange using the SWIFT FIN standard.  

 Operations include the administration and management of BizTalk Server applications. A4SWIFT uses the following tools and consoles to perform these operations:  

- **BizTalk Server Administration Console.** Use this tool to manage the BizTalk group, including all BizTalk databases, to track the performance of business processes.  

- **Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) Framework.** Use this tool to track data items and business milestones collected during business transactions.  

  The SWIFT disassembler enhances (decorates) messages that it processes with A4SWIFT promoted properties. As such, HAT and BAM query expressions optionally include these properties for filtering. For a list of A4SWIFT promoted properties, see [A4SWIFT_* Promoted Properties](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/a4swift-promoted-properties.md).  

  For information about [!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)]BizTalk Server operations, see the Operations section in BizTalk Server Help.  

  This section contains:  

- [Repairing Messages and Submitting New Messages](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/repairing-messages-and-submitting-new-messages.md)  

- [Administrative Operations](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/administrative-operations.md)
