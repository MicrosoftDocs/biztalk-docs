# Network Load Balancing
A distributed A4SWIFT deployment may contain BizTalk Server computers for messaging, orchestration, SharePoint Servers to host MRSR site, or SQL Server databases. If your usage profile and business needs are great enough, you may need to set up network load balancing (NLB) for two or more BizTalk HTTP front-end (MRSR site) servers or two or more BizTalk messaging servers. For an example of multiple servers in need of network load balancing, see the "Example of a full A4SWIFT deployment" diagram in [Physical Diagram](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/physical-diagram.md).  
  
 For more information on network load balancing, see the BizTalk Server Deployment Guide, and [Step 2: Configuring NLB on the Servers](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/step-2-configuring-nlb-on-the-servers.md).
