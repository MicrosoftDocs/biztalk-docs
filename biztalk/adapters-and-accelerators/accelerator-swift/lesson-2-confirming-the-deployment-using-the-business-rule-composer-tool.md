# Lesson 2: Confirming the Deployment Using the Business Rule Composer Tool
In this lesson, you confirm that the Business Rule Composer tool created your vocabularies and deployed your policies. A vocabulary is a collection of vocabulary elements you use in rule composition. A policy is a versioned collection of business rules.  
  
### To confirm the deployment using the Business Rule Composer tool  
  
1.  Start **Business Rule Composer** in BizTalk Server.  
  
2.  In the Open Rule Store dialog box, click **OK**.  
  
3.  In the Facts Explorer pane of the Business Rule Composer tool, confirm that the vocabularies you want appear in the Facts Explorer, as shown in the following figure.  
  
     ![Image that shows the Vocabularies tab.](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/media/tut2-scrn2.gif "Tut2_scrn2")  
  
4.  In the Policy Explorer, confirm that the Business Rule Composer tool deployed the following policies:  
  
     MT103_Master_Policy  
  
     MT103_Validation_Policy  
  
     SWIFT_NetworkRule149_Policy  
  
     SWIFT_NetworkRule150_Policy  
  
     SWIFT_NetworkRule151_Policy  
  
     SWIFT_NetworkRule175_Policy  
  
     SWIFT_NetworkRule2_Policy  
  
     SWIFT_NetworkRule201_Policy  
  
     SWIFT_NetworkRule202_Policy  
  
     SWIFT_NetworkRule203_Policy  
  
     SWIFT_NetworkRule204_Policy  
  
     SWIFT_NetworkRule205_Policy  
  
     SWIFT_NetworkRule206_Policy  
  
     SWIFT_NetworkRule207_Policy  
  
     SWIFT_NetworkRule209_Policy  
  
     SWIFT_NetworkRule210_Policy  
  
     SWIFT_NetworkRule212_Policy  
  
     SWIFT_NetworkRule213_Policy  
  
     SWIFT_NetworkRule215_Policy  
  
     SWIFT_NetworkRule216_Policy  
  
     SWIFT_NetworkRule217_Policy  
  
     SWIFT_NetworkRule218_Policy  
  
     SWIFT_NetworkRule244_Policy  
  
     SWIFT_NetworkRule245_Policy  
  
     SWIFT_NetworkRule81_Policy  
  
     SWIFT_PartyIdentifier_Policy  
  
     SWIFT_Reference_Policy  
  
### To view a policy  
  
1. In the Policy Explorer pane of the Business Rules Composer, ensure that the **SWIFT_NetworkRule149_Policy** is expanded, and then expand the **Version 1.0 â€“ Deployed** node.  
  
2. Double-click the **Validate_MT103** node to open it.  
  
    The policy opens in the editor pane on the right side of the screen.  
  
   Proceed to [Module 7: Testing a Valid Flat File Instance](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/module-7-testing-a-valid-flat-file-instance.md).
