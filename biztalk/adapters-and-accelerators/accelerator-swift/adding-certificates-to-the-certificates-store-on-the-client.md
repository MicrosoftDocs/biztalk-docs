# Adding Certificates to the Certificates Store on the Client
Use the following steps to add certificates to the Personal folder in the certificates store on each client computer. The certificates must be added to the Personal folder in the Certificates - Current User store.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  If your certificates are not distributed via an enterprise trusted Certification Authority, you must import the Certification Authority's root certificate onto the client computer(s). Otherwise, your personal certificates will not work. Import the Certification Authority's certificate into the Trusted Root Certification Authorities folder in the Certificates (Local Computer) node.
