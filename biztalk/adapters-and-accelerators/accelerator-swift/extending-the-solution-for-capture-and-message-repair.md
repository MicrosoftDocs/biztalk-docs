# Extending the Solution for Capture and Message Repair
The MT103 End-to-End Tutorial in this Help shows you how to construct a BizTalk orchestration that subscribes to failed SWIFT messages.  
  
 The orchestration in the MT103 End-to-End Tutorial uses the static methods of a helper class, **ErrorExtractor**, to extract the error part and body from the message as strings. The orchestration then writes the parts to separate files.  
  
 Because the error part of the failed message is a serialization of the **ErrorCollection** constructed by the pipeline component, you can deserialize the collection and use it to automate more of the error reporting and handling. The following [!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[btsVCSharp](../../includes/btsvcsharp-md.md)] code fragment illustrates how to deserialize the error message part of a failed message and iterate over the parsing errors in the collection. The code fragment omits namespace qualifications for readability:  
  
```  
// instantiate an appropriate XmlTextReader  
// xm contains the message  
string sError = ErrorExtractor.GetErrorPartAsString(xm);  
StringReader sRdr = new StringReader(sError);  
XmlTextReader xRdr = new XmlTextReader(sRdr);  
  
// deserialize the collection  
ErrorCollection eC = ErrorCollection.GetErrorCollection(xRdr);  
  
// loop over the parsing errors in the collection  
IEnumerator pEnum = eC.GetParseErrorEnumerator();  
while(pEnum.MoveNext())   
{  
  // pEnum.Current() returns a ParseError object for processing  
}  
  
```  
  
 The **ErrorCollection** includes methods for iterating over errors by type as well as for iterating over all of the errors in the collection. For more information about the **ErrorCollection**, see ErrorCollection Members.
