# Preparing for Deployment
This section provides information about the planning and preparation phase of the deployment. Before implementing a deployment, make the following preparations:  
  
1. Read and understand any known issues, and prepare the equipment:  
  
   -   Create a checklist of the hardware and software required for your deployment, and a network diagram and deployment worksheet that reflect your variation of the deployment (based on the network diagram and for the deployment architecture you have selected).  
  
   -   Acquire the hardware and software on your checklist. This acquisition includes downloading all of the service packs, hotfixes, and software updates that are required for your deployment.  
  
        Download these software components using a computer with Internet access and then copy these software components onto a CD-ROM for easier distribution.  
  
2. Separate your deployment into different stages and identify the tasks associated with each stage. This strategy simplifies the deployment process by organizing the tasks according to a specific deployment stage. For example, the prescribed deployment includes the following server deployment stages:  
  
3. Configuring the domain controller.  
  
4. Configuring the databases (including the run-time [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] cluster and design-time database server).  
  
5. Configuring the BizTalk servers.
