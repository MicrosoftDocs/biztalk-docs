# Lesson 5: Adding the SWIFT Disassembler to a Custom Receive Pipeline
In this lesson, you add the custom SWIFT disassembler (DASM) to your pipeline. A DASM pipeline component is a pipeline component that divides messages in a batch into individual documents.  
  
 The DASM pipeline components provided in [!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)] are:  
  
-   Flat file disassembler  
  
-   BizTalk Framework disassembler  
  
-   XML disassembler  
  
 [!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[A4SWIFT_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/a4swift-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] adds an additional SWIFT disassembler.  
  
### To add the SWIFT custom disassembler to your pipeline  
  
1.  From the View menu, click **Toolbox**.  
  
2.  From the **BizTalk Pipeline Components Toolbox**, click **SWIFT Disassembler** and drag it to the **Drop Here** box below the **Disassemble** stage shape in **BizTalk Pipeline Designer**. Leave the **SWIFT Disassembler** shape selected in the **BizTalk Pipeline Designer**.  
  
3.  In the **Properties** pane, select **Microsoft.Solutions.FinancialServices.SWIFT.RuntimeSchemas.HeaderSchema** for the **SWIFT Header Schema** property.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Do not confuse **SWIFT Header Schema** and Message Header Schema. You must set **SWIFT Header Schema** in step 3.  
  
4.  In the **Properties** pane, ensure that the **BRE Validation** property is set to **True**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  An explanation of the Business Rule Engine (BRE) follows later in this tutorial.  
  
5.  In the **Properties** pane, ensure that the **XML Validation** property is set to **True**.  
  
6.  In the **Properties** pane, ensure that the **Inbound Debatching** property is set to **False**.  
  
7.  On the **File** menu, select **Save All** to save your changes.
