# Multiple Views of MX InfoPath forms
The MX InfoPath form templates might be divided into separate views. If the total number of fields in the schema is large, then there will be different views of the same template otherwise there will be only a single view of the template.While doing the Message Repair in the Message Repair and New submission workflow, the different views of the message can be browsed from the View Menu.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Even if the field containing error is not in the default view, then also the name of the field can be seen from the validation window in the task pane. The corresponding field can be searched manually in all the other views. Once the Message becomes completely valid, then the form can be submitted from any of the views. Switching between the larger views might take 1-3 minutes for the view to get properly loaded and opened.
