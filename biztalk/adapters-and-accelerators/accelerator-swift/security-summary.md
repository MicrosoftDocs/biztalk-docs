# Security Summary
## Overview
Microsoft [!INCLUDE[A4SWIFT_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/a4swift-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] provides development and runtime components to facilitate BizTalk applications that provide SWIFT messaging and automation functionality. Applications developed by using [!INCLUDE[A4SWIFT_CurrentVersion_abbrev_md](../../includes/a4swift-currentversion-abbrev-md.md)] are BizTalk applications and are secured by native [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion_md](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[btsInpathNoVersion](../../includes/btsinpathnoversion-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[btsWinSharePointSvcsNoVersion](../../includes/btswinsharepointsvcsnoversion-md.md)], and IIS/ASP[!INCLUDE[btsDotNet](../../includes/btsdotnet-md.md)] security features.

 [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] protects privacy of system elements by using de facto Internet encrypted communications standards and protocols. Communication participants, processes, and information are secured by using signing certificates, [!INCLUDE[btsWinNoVersion](../../includes/btswinnoversion-md.md)] Authentication, and Enterprise Single Sign-On. [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] also enforces authorization of resource usage with mechanisms such as [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] Roles and [!INCLUDE[btsWinNoVersion](../../includes/btswinnoversion-md.md)] Authentication, and the MessageBox database.

 In addition to native [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] security features, [!INCLUDE[A4SWIFT_CurrentVersion_abbrev_md](../../includes/a4swift-currentversion-abbrev-md.md)] defines and enforces security semantics for the creation, repair, approval, and submission of SWIFT messages by business users. This user-level security is enforced by using [!INCLUDE[btsInpathNoVersion](../../includes/btsinpathnoversion-md.md)] digital signing technologies on the user workstation, and certificate and data integrity verification by [!INCLUDE[A4SWIFT_CurrentVersion_abbrev_md](../../includes/a4swift-currentversion-abbrev-md.md)] runtime services on the server.

 Together, [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion_md](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[A4SWIFT_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/a4swift-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] provide the platform, infrastructure, and tools for designing, developing, and executing secure SWIFT messaging and workflow automation systems.
