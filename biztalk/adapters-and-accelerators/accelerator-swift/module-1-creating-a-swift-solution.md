# Module 1: Creating a SWIFT Solution
In this module, you create a blank BizTalk solution. In the first lesson, you create a new solution by using [!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)][!INCLUDE[btsDotNet](../../includes/btsdotnet-md.md)]. You also create the individual projects that contain your BizTalk solution components such as schema, maps, orchestrations, and pipeline components.  
  
 Note that a solution may include only one BizTalk project, or it may include many BizTalk projects (if the solution consists of numerous projects, which you develop independently and which you must integrate later).  
  
### To create a blank BizTalk solution  
  
1. Start **Visual Studio**.  
  
2. On the **File** menu, point to **New**, and then click **Project**.  
  
3. In the **Project Types** pane of the New Project dialog box, select the **BizTalk Projects**. In the Templates pane, select **Empty BizTalk Server Project**.  
  
4. In the **Name** box, type **SWIFTProject** as the solution name.  
  
5. In the **Location** box, type **\<*drive*\>:\labs**.  
  
6. Click **OK** to open the new project.  
  
    [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] creates an empty solution in Solution Explorer and a new blank solution in the \<*drive*:\>\labs folder.  
  
   Proceed to [Module 2: Adding a New Schemas Project](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/module-2-adding-a-new-schemas-project.md).
