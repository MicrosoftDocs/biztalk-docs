# Runtime, message repair, FIN response, and messaging

## Overview
Microsoft [!INCLUDE[A4SWIFT_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/a4swift-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] provides customers and partners with financial-industry-specific messaging and connectivity functionality, which helps accelerate implementation of [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] as middleware for financial organizations.  
  
 By leveraging the open-standards based tools and runtime facilities of [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] to implement support for message formats like SWIFT, A4SWIFT reduces the barrier to adoption of updated SWIFT standards by employing [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] as a general-purpose middleware integration platform.  
  
 A4SWIFT and [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] reduce the time-to-market while also decreasing the total cost of ownership (TCO) by reducing the overall maintenance and support cost of delivering enterprise class servers for application hosting and integration as well as workflow implementation in the financial services industry.  
  
 You can broadly categorize A4SWIFT functionality as SWIFT messaging and SWIFT connectivity. Full A4SWIFT messaging encompasses SWIFT message parsing and validation (including inbound/outbound batching), message entry and repair (including integration with Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsOfficeNoVersion](../../includes/btsofficenoversion-md.md)][!INCLUDE[btsInpathNoVersion](../../includes/btsinpathnoversion-md.md)] as the front-end user tool), and other line-of-business (LOB) applications.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[A4SWIFT_CurrentVersion_abbrev](../../includes/a4swift-currentversion-abbrev-md.md)] provides XSD schemas and full validation, including network rules, for all 358 of the financial (FIN) messages. It also provides inbound debatching.
