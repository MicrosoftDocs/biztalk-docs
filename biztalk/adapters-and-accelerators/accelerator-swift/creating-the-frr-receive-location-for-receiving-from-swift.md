# Creating the FRR Receive Location for Receiving from SWIFT
To perform FIN Response Reconciliation, you need to create a receive location that receives a message from the SWIFT Network into A4SWIFT.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  It is advisable to set up two receive locations for receiving messages from SAA: one to receive PAN/NANs and one to receive all other messages. To set up the two receive locations, you must receive messages from two MQSeries queues at SAA: one for PAN/NANs and one for all other message types.  
  
 **Summary**  
  
 Create a receive location with the following properties and components:  
  
|Property/Component|Setting|  
|-------------------------|-------------|  
|Receive port|One-way port|  
|Transport type|MQSeries|  
|Queue Definition (MQSeries)|MQSeries server<br />Queue manager<br />Queue|  
|Receive handler|BizTalkServerApplication|  
|Receive pipeline|The A4SWIFT receive pipeline that you created for FRR|  
  
### To add an FRR receive location for receiving from SWIFT  
  
1.  In the BizTalk Server Administration Console, expand **BizTalk Server Administration**, **BizTalk Group**, **Applications**, and  **BizTalk Application 1** nodes.
