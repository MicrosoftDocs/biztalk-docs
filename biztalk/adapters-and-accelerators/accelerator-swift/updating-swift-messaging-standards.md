# Updating SWIFT Messaging Standards
The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) updates their messaging standards annually as the financial services industry proposes and adopts changes to the standards. When SWIFT updates their Standards Release Guide, [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] schemas and BRE policies must be updated to conform to the latest SWIFT specifications.

 SWIFT typically announces preliminary updates 12 months before you are required by the SWIFT network to have the changes implemented. The updates are typically finalized nine months prior to SWIFT's "go live" date. You should consider this timeline when you plan any [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] implementation.

 For more information about the latest [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] updates and releases, go to the BizTalk Accelerator for SWIFT Web site at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=28272](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=28272).
