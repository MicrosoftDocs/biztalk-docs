# FRR NAK Handler Sample
The FRR NAK Handler sample demonstrates how to create a custom handler to process messages that FIN Response Reconciliation (FRR) has correlated with SWIFT responses. This custom handler processes messages that FRR has correlated with a MTS21_FIN_ACKNAK negative-acknowledgment message, which indicates that SWIFT did not successfully receive the message from A4SWIFT. The custom handler adds an error object to the message, making the message a two-part message, and promotes the properties that cause the message-repair orchestration to pick up the message. As a result, a repairer can fix the message and resend it to SWIFT Alliance Access (SAA).  
  
 **Sample Components**  
  
 The FRR NAK Handler sample includes the following components:  
  
-   **RepairSWIFTRejectedMessage.odx.** This orchestration is the custom handler that processes a message that SWIFT could not successfully receive, routing it to the message-repair orchestration so a repairer can fix and resend the message.  
  
-   **RepairSWIFTRejectedMessage.btproj.** This project includes RepairSWIFTRejectedMessage.odx and the references required for the project to build and deploy.  
  
-   **RepairSWIFTRejectedMessage.sln.** This solution includes the RepairSWIFTRejectedMessage.btproj project.
