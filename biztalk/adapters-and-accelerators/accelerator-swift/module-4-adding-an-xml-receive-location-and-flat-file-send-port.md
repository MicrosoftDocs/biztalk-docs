# Module 4: Adding an XML Receive Location and Flat File Send Port
In this module, you add one receive port and location, and one send port. You use the receive port and location to receive XML-formatted MT103 messages from an inbound file folder. You use the send port to send the validated MT103 flat file messages to an outbound file folder.
