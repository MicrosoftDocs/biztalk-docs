# Installing and Configuring BizTalk Accelerator for SWIFT on Messaging Servers
This section describes how to install and configure [!INCLUDE[A4SWIFT_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/a4swift-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] on the messaging servers. These servers are mainly used to communicate with the SWIFT Network.  

### To install and configure BizTalk Accelerator for A4SWIFT on the Messaging Server  

1. Perform a Custom Install of [!INCLUDE[A4SWIFT_CurrentVersion_abbrev](../../includes/a4swift-currentversion-abbrev-md.md)]. Install the **MRSR** and **SWIFT Messages** features.  

   > [!NOTE]
   >  You do not need to install the Web Components for Message Repair and New Submission feature because this server does not have MRSR site.  

   > [!NOTE]
   >  After installation is complete, the Configuration Wizard starts.  

2. In the Microsoft [!INCLUDE[A4SWIFT_CurrentVersion_abbrev](../../includes/a4swift-currentversion-abbrev-md.md)] Configuration console, configure **MCRR**.
