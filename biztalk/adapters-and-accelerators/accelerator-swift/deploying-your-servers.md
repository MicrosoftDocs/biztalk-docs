# Deploying Your Servers
This section provides instructions for configuring each of the servers in your [!INCLUDE[A4SWIFT_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/a4swift-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] deployment. After you configure the network you deploy the software on each server by using the following steps.  
  
 Before starting server deployment, make sure that you read and perform the deployment preparation steps described in [Preparing for Deployment](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/preparing-for-deployment.md). Failing to adhere to the prescriptive guidance in the previous section might result in an unknown and unsupported configuration of the deployment (and subsequent steps might fail).  
  
 For more information, see the BizTalk Server Deployment Guide.
