# Getting started with BizTalk Accelerator for SWIFT
Microsoft [!INCLUDE[A4SWIFT_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/a4swift-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] provides a set of schemas, rules, and associated tools to assist you in the integration of SWIFT messaging with your internal applications. A4SWIFT requires MicrosoftBizTalk Server, and uses [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] components and features to implement schemas, parsing, validation, rules processing, and orchestration. A4SWIFT also implements debatching of files containing multiple financial (FIN) messages, message repair and new submission, and FIN response reconciliation.

 You can get immediate hands-on experience with A4SWIFT by going directly to the A4SWIFT End-to-End Tutorial. [Module 1: Creating a SWIFT Solution](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/module-1-creating-a-swift-solution.md) helps you build an enterprise application integration (EAI) solution that automates an internal business process. [Module 2: Adding a New Schemas Project](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/module-2-adding-a-new-schemas-project.md) builds your EAI project by helping you develop an automated solution to process selected SWIFT FIN messages.
