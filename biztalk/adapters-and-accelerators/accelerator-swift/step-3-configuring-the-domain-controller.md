# Step 3: Configuring the Domain Controller
This section describes how to configure the domain controller in your [!INCLUDE[A4SWIFT_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/a4swift-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] deployment. Specifically, this section describes how to install and configure [!INCLUDE[btsAD](../../includes/btsad-md.md)] by doing the following:  

-   Installing Active Directory and DNS  

-   Creating the required accounts  

-   Joining the domain  

## Installing Active Directory and DNS  
 Use the [!INCLUDE[btsAD](../../includes/btsad-md.md)] Installation Wizard to simplify the process of configuring a domain controller. After installing Active Directory, create a Domain Name System (DNS) reverse lookup zone. Then create and add hosts to the forward and reverse lookup zones.  

## Creating the Required Accounts  
 The following table provides details on how to create the Global Security groups. Create the following **Global Security** groups and users on the domain controller using your own naming conventions. The examples provided below are used for simplicity. Add the specified members in the list to the created groups.  

 When creating groups, select **Global** for the Group Scope and **Security** for the Group Type.

> [!NOTE]
>  All group accounts should be global security accounts and not local domain accounts. If local domain group accounts (created using net localgroup) are used, the setup program for [!INCLUDE[A4SWIFT_CurrentVersion_abbrev](../../includes/a4swift-currentversion-abbrev-md.md)] cannot validate specific [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] domain users.  

## Joining the Domain  
 After you have created the domain and the domain controllers have restarted, join each server to the domain.
