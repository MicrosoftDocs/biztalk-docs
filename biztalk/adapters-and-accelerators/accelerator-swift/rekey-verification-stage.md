# Rekey Verification Stage
When a Rekey Verification stage occurs in the message repair workflow, a copy of the original message is maintained by Message Repair and New Submission and an exact copy of the message is sent to the verifier's inbox for rekey verification. In rekey verification, [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] Message Repair and New Submission clears specified fields for manual re-entry.  
  
 This concept is explained further in the [Server Runtime Security](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/server-runtime-security.md) topic. The [!INCLUDE[btaA4SWIFT2.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btaa4swift2-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] user participating in the Rekey Verification stage must manually re-enter into the cleared fields, through the [!INCLUDE[btsInpathNoVersion](../../includes/btsinpathnoversion-md.md)] form, values that exactly match those in the original message (from either the Create or Repair stage). The verifier then signs the message with a valid certificate and submits the message.  
  
 If the values of the rekeyed fields do not match the original message fields exactly, Message Repair and New Submission resets the stage in the workflow and sends the message back to the repairer's inbox. It also validates the signature of the verifier who rekeyed the fields. If the verifier is not validated, it sends the message back to the verifier's inbox.
