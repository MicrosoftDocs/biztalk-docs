# Microsoft BizTalk Accelerator for SWIFT documentation
[!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[A4SWIFT_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/a4swift-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] is an add-in to [!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)], and leverages the open standards-based tools and run-time facilities of [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)] to implement support for Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) message formats.  
  
 This added functionality makes it easier for businesses to adopt [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)] as a general-purpose middleware integration platform. With A4SWIFT, customers, partners, and system integrators can streamline the development, deployment, and support of integration solutions for core financial services application infrastructure and business processes.  

## Install, configure, and deploy
[Install, configure, and deploy](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/install-configure-and-deploy-the-biztalk-accelerator-for-swift.md) shows you how to install and configure the acclerator on your BizTalk Server. You can also configure the runtime, message repair, and FIN response. 

Use this section to also set up a network configuration, and deploy your servers. 

## Get started
[Getting started](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/getting-started-with-biztalk-accelerator-for-swift.md) includes some end-to-end tutorials.  

## Messaging  
[Runtime, message repair, FIN response, and messaging](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/runtime-message-repair-fin-response-and-messaging.md) describes how data flows through the SWIFT assembler and disassembler, explains message repair, explains how the different artifacts handle messages, and more. 

## Security  
[Security and privacy standards](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/security-and-privacy-standards.md) provides more details on security in BizTalk Server, the runtime, and the SWIFT users and groups. 

## Developing apps  
[Programmers guide](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/programmers-guide-frr-nak-sample-and-tools.md) includes FRR NAK handler sample, and tools.

## Operations  
[Operational tasks](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/operational-tasks.md) discusses message repair, verifying and approving messages, and provides info on using Business Rules Engine (BRE), and more. 

## Troubleshoot  
[Troubleshooting](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-swift/troubleshooting-and-known-issues.md) lists some guidance on the different parts to this accelerator, and also lists some known issues.
