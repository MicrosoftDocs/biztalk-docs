# Read about BizTalk Adapter for Siebel Binding Properties
The [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_md](../../includes/adaptersiebel-md.md)] surfaces several binding properties that enable you to control some of its run-time and design-time behavior. This section describes these binding properties and provides links to topics that explain how you can set them.  

## The Siebel Adapter Binding Properties  
 The following table shows the [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)] binding properties grouped by category. The category refers to the node under which each binding property appears in the dialog boxes that are presented by different applications to configure the adapter (or binding).

Otherwise, set this to **False**.<br /><br /> When using the adapters from [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], you must always set the property to **True**.

The [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)] forms the file name by appending "Client" to the value of the **Name** property The default is "SiebelBinding"; for this value, the generated file will be named "SiebelBindingClient".                                                         |        string         |

When a connection is idle for a period that exceeds this timeout, the connection will be disposed.

The default is 5. **MaxConnectionsPerSystem** is a static property within an application domain. This means that when you change **MaxConnectionsPerSystem** for one binding instance in an application domain, the new value applies to all objects created from all binding instances within that application domain.                                                                                      |  int (System.Int32)   |

The default is **true**; performance counters are enabled. The [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)] LOB Latency performance counter measures the total time the adapter spends in making calls to the Siebel system.                                                                   | bool (System.Boolean) |

The default is **false**, which disables user credentials in the connection URI.

## How Do I Set Siebel Binding Properties?  
 You can set the Siebel binding properties when you configure a connection to a Siebel system. For information about how to set binding properties when you:  

- Use the [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservlong](../../includes/consumeadapterservlong-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservreflong](../../includes/addadapterservreflong-md.md)], see [Connect to the Siebel System in Visual Studio](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-siebel/connect-to-the-siebel-system-in-visual-studio.md).  

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  >  While using the [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservshort](../../includes/consumeadapterservshort-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)], if you do not specify a value for a binding property of type string and whose default value is null then that binding property will not be available in the binding file (an XML file) or the app.config file respectively. You must manually add the binding property and its value in the binding file or the app.config file, if required.  

- Configure a send port or receive port (location) in a [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] solution, see [Configure a physical port binding using a port binding file to Siebel](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-siebel/configure-a-physical-port-binding-using-a-port-binding-file-to-siebel.md).

- Use the WCF channel model in a programming solution, see [Create a channel using Siebel](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-siebel/create-a-channel-using-siebel.md).  

- Use the WCF service model in a programming solution, see [Configure a WCF Client for a Siebel System](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-siebel/configure-a-wcf-client-for-a-siebel-system.md).  

- Use the WCF ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (svcutil.exe), see [Using the ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool with the BizTalk Adapter for Siebel eBusiness Applications](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-siebel/use-the-servicemodel-metadata-utility-with-the-siebel-adapter.md).
