# Troubleshoot Installation Issues with the Siebel adapter
The Microsoft [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)] installation copies the product binaries on the computer and registers the bindings for each adapter. This section discusses troubleshooting techniques to resolve installation errors.  
  
## Setup Logging  
 The [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)] setup program performs the standard task of installing the [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)]. Additionally, the setup also performs certain custom actions such as registering the adapter bindings. You can log messages for both the standard as well as custom actions performed by the setup.  
  
-   The [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)] setup installs the adapter specific files using an MSI. Hence, the logging for the setup will be the standard MSI logging.  
  
-   Logs for the custom actions performed by the setup program are available at %TEMP%\adaptersetup.log. If the tracing to the log file fails, the traces are also available in the event log.  
  
## Known Issues  
  
### Setup fails to register adapter bindings  
 **Problem**  
  
 The Microsoft [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)] setup wizard fails to register the [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)] binding or the [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersiebelshort](../../includes/adoprovidersiebelshort-md.md)], but proceeds with the adapter installation.  
  
 **Cause**  
  
 This might result due to problems with WCF installation, [!INCLUDE[afproductnamelong](../../includes/afproductnamelong-md.md)] installation, or the machine.config being corrupt. The adapter bindings are written to the machine.config file.  
  
 **Resolution**  
  
Manually register the [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)] binding and [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersiebelshort](../../includes/adoprovidersiebelshort-md.md)] using the following steps: 
  
1.  Navigate to the machine.config file on the computer. For example, on a 32-bit platform, the machine.config is available under \<system drive\>:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\\<version\>\CONFIG.  
  
     In this path, \<version\> is the version of the .NET Framework.  
  
2.  Open the file using a text editor.  
  
3.  To register the [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)] binding:  
  
    1.  Search for the element "system.serviceModel" and add the following under it:  
  
        ```  
        <client>  
          <endpoint binding="siebelBinding" contract="IMetadataExchange" name="siebel" />  
        </client>  
        ```  
  
    2.  Search for the element "bindingElementExtensions" under system.serviceModel\extensions.  
  
    3.  Look for the missing [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)] binding. Add the following section under the "bindingElementExtensions" node.  
  
         For [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)], add:  
  
        ```  
        <add name="siebelAdapter" type="Microsoft.Adapters.Siebel.SiebelAdapterExtensionElement,Microsoft.Adapters.Siebel, Version=<version>, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=<public key>" />  
        ```  
  
    4.  Search for the element "bindingExtensions" under system.serviceModel\extensions.  
  
    5.  Look for the missing [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)] binding. Add the following sections under the "bindingExtensions" node.  
  
         For [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)], add:  
  
        ```  
        <add name="siebelBinding" type="Microsoft.Adapters.Siebel.SiebelAdapterBindingSection,Microsoft.Adapters.Siebel, Version=<version>, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=<public key>" />  
        ```  
  
        > [!NOTE]
        >  For information about how to determine the public key, see [Determining the Public Key and Version](#BKMK_PubKey).  
  
4.  To register the [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersiebelshort](../../includes/adoprovidersiebelshort-md.md)]:  
  
    1.  Search for the element DbProviderFactories under the system.data node.  
  
    2.  Look for the missing [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersiebelshort](../../includes/adoprovidersiebelshort-md.md)]. Add the following section under the DbProviderFactories node.  
  
         For [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersiebelshort](../../includes/adoprovidersiebelshort-md.md)], add:  
  
        ```  
        <add name="SiebelClient Data Provider" invariant="Microsoft.Data.SiebelClient"  
            description=".NET Framework Data Provider for Siebel eBusiness Applications"  
            type="Microsoft.Data.SiebelClient.SiebelProviderFactory,Microsoft.Data.SiebelClient, Version=<version>, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=<public key>" />  
        ```  
  
5.  Save and close the machine.config file.  
  
####  <a name="BKMK_PubKey"></a> Determining the Public Key and Version  
 Perform the following steps to determine the public key for [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersiebelshort](../../includes/adoprovidersiebelshort-md.md)].  
  
###### To determine the public key  
  
1.  Navigate to the Windows directory, typically C:\WINDOWS\assembly.  
  
2.  Right-click the DLL for which you want the public key and select **Properties**. The following table lists the name of the DLLs for each adapter and provider.  
  
    |Adapter/ADO Provider|Name of the DLL|  
    |---------------------------|---------------------|  
    |[!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)]|Microsoft.Adapters.Siebel|  
    |[!INCLUDE[adoprovidersiebelshort](../../includes/adoprovidersiebelshort-md.md)]|Microsoft.Data.SiebelClient|  
  
3.  On the **General** tab, the value against the **Public Key Token** label specifies the public key for the DLL. Similarly, value against the **Version** label specifies the version number for the DLL.  
  
4.  Copy the public key, and then click **Cancel**.
