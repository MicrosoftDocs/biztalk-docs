# Import Siebel Data Using Visual Studio
This section provides information about how to use Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] to import data from a Siebel system into a SQL Server database. It also provides instructions on how to create and execute an SSIS package to import this data.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 Before performing the procedures provided in this topic, make sure:  
  
- The [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersiebelshort](../../includes/adoprovidersiebelshort-md.md)] is installed on the computer.  
  
- Microsoft Visual Studio is installed on the computer.  
  
## Import in Visual Studio  
 
1. Start [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] and create an Integration Service project.  
  
2. From the **Project** menu, select **SSIS Import and Export Wizard**. This starts the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard.  
  
3. Read the information on the Welcome screen, and then click **Next**.  
  
4. In the **Choose a Data Source** dialog box, from the **Data Source** drop-down list **.NET Framework Data Provider for Siebel eBusiness Applications**. Specify values for the different connection properties for the [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersiebelshort](../../includes/adoprovidersiebelshort-md.md)] connection string. For more information about the connection string properties, see [Data provider properties for the Siebel connection string](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-siebel/data-provider-properties-for-the-siebel-connection-string.md).  
  
    Click **Next**.  
  
5. In the **Choose a Destination** dialog box:  
  
   1.  From the **Destination** drop-down list, select **SQL Native Client**.  
  
   2.  From the **Server name** drop-down list, select a SQL Server name.  
  
   3.  Select an authentication mode.  
  
   4.  From the **Database** drop-down list, select the database to which you want to import the Siebel table.  
  
   5.  Click **Next**.  
  
6. In the **Specify Table Copy or Query** dialog box, choose the **Write a query to specify the data to transfer** option.  
  
7. In the **Provide a Source Query** dialog box, specify a SELECT query to filter the data to be imported into the SQL Server. For more information about the grammar for a SELECT query for the [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersiebelshort](../../includes/adoprovidersiebelshort-md.md)], see [Syntax for a SELECT Statement in Siebel](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-siebel/syntax-for-a-select-statement-in-siebel.md).  
  
8. To validate the query, click the **Parse** button, click **OK** in the pop-up dialog box, and then click **Next**.  
  
9. In the **Select Source Tables and Views** dialog box, select the check box against the source and destination tables. The source is the query you specified to retrieve data from Siebel. The destination will be the table that will be created in the SQL Server database.  
  
10. The wizard creates a default mapping between the source and destination table fields. However, you can change the mappings according to your requirement. To change the field mappings, click **Edit Mappings**.  
  
11. In the **Column Mappings** dialog box, you can:  
  
    - Change the names of columns in the destination table.  
  
    - Ignore certain columns in the destination table.  
  
    - Change the data type for fields in destination table.  
  
    - Change other field attributes such as nullable, size, precision, and scale.  
  
    - Click **OK**.  
  
      ![Column mappings between Siebel and SQL table](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-siebel/media/a3047801-3fa6-496b-91d8-3888dfbb0169.gif "a3047801-3fa6-496b-91d8-3888dfbb0169")  
  
12. In the **Select Source Tables and Views** dialog box, click **Next**.  
  
13. In the **Complete the Wizard** dialog box, review the summary of actions that the wizard will perform, and then click **Finish**.  
  
14. In the **Performing Operations** dialog box, the wizard starts executing tasks to import the information from Siebel into a SQL Server database table. The status for each task is displayed in the wizard.  
  
15. After all the tasks are successfully executed, click **Close**. If a task fails, see the corresponding error message, fix the issue, and rerun the wizard.  
  
16. The wizard adds an SSIS package to your Integration Service project. Save the Integration Service project.  
  
## Run the SSIS Package  
 Once the package is created within an Integration Service project, you can execute it to import data from a Siebel system into a SQL Server database. Perform the following steps to import Siebel data by executing the package.  
  
1.  Navigate to the SSIS package in Solution Explorer.  
  
2.  Right-click the package name, and then select **Execute Package**.  
  
[Run Integration Services (SSIS) Packages](/sql/integration-services/packages/run-integration-services-ssis-packages) provides more info. 
  
## Verify the Results  
 After executing the package, you must verify the results by logging on to the SQL Server and navigating to the database to which the Siebel data is imported. Executing the package should have created a table in the destination database. This table should be populated with the values from the Siebel table.
