# What operations are supported by the Siebel adapter
Adapter clients can perform operations on the Siebel system by either:  
  
- Creating BizTalk projects.  
  
- Using the WCF channel model.  
  
- Using the WCF service model.  
  
  The [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)] exposes operations that applications can invoke on it and that it can, in turn, invoke on applications. These operations are invoked by sending SOAP messages over a channel. If a response is required, it is returned in a SOAP message over the same channel. For information about the message structure and the SOAP action associated with each operation, see [Messages and Message Schemas for BizTalk Adapter for Siebel eBusiness Applications](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-siebel/messages-and-message-schemas-for-siebel-adapter-in-biztalk.md).  
  
  This section provides information about the operations supported on the Siebel system using the [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)].  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)] does not support receiving inbound calls from a Siebel system.
