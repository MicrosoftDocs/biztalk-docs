# Connect to Siebel using the adapter
The [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)] requires adapter clients to provide a connection string, called the connection Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), to connect to a Siebel system. With a connection URI, adapter clients can specify connection parameters to connect to an external system. For more information about the connection URI, see [Create a Connection to the Siebel System](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-siebel/create-a-connection-to-the-siebel-system.md).  
  
 Make sure you comply with the security guidelines when establishing a connection with the Siebel system. For more information about security guidelines, see [Secure your Siebel applications](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-siebel/secure-your-siebel-applications.md).
