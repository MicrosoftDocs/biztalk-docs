# Create a channel using Siebel
This section demonstrates how to create a channel for direct messaging with Siebel by providing and consuming XML messages.  
  
```  
//create a channel factory, capable of sending a request to Siebel and receiving a reply (IRequestChannel)  
IChannelFactory<IRequestChannel> factory = binding.BuildChannelFactory<IRequestChannel>(new BindingParameterCollection());  
  
//open factory  
factory.Open();  
  
//obtain a channel from the factory by specifying the address you want to connect to  
IRequestChannel irc = factory.CreateChannel(address);  
  
//open the channel  
irc.Open();  
  
//perform operations  
…………  
…………  
…………  
  
//close the channel  
irc.Close();  
  
//close the factory  
factory.Close();  
```  
  
 Once you have created the channel, you can use that channel to perform operations on Siebel.
