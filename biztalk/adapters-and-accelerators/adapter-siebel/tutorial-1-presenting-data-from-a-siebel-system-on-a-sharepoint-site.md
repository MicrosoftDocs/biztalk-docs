# Tutorial 1: Presenting Data From a Siebel System on a SharePoint Site
This tutorial provides detailed instructions on using the [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)] with Microsoft Office SharePoint Server to present business data from a Siebel system on a SharePoint portal. To demonstrate how to use the [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)] with Office SharePoint Server, we create an application in Office SharePoint Server to retrieve a list of customer accounts from the Siebel repository using the [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)].  
  
 To extract this information from the Siebel system, the example invokes the Query method on the **Account** business components.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Before proceeding with the tutorial, make sure you have installed all the prerequisites for using the [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)] with Office SharePoint Server. For more information about the prerequisites, see the [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)] installation guide, typically installed at \<installation drive\>:\Program Files\Microsoft [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)]\Documents.
