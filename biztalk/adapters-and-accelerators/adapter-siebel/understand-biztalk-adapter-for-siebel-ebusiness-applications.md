# Understand BizTalk Adapter for Siebel eBusiness Applications
The [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)] enables service-oriented programmatic access in order to interact with an external system. The adapters provide the following advantages to clients:  
  
-   **Consistent design-time experience**. The adapters provide a common and user-friendly design time experience for browsing, searching, and retrieving metadata of LOB artifacts.  
  
-   **Varied programming options**. The adapters provide a choice of programming model including Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) channel model, WCF service model, ADO.NET, Web services, or BizTalk supported models.  
  
-   **Uniform experience across LOBs**. The adapters standardize on using the WCF and [!INCLUDE[afproductnamelong](../../includes/afproductnamelong-md.md)] and hence provide a uniform experience of gaining access to any LOB system.  
  
 As mentioned, the adapters are built on top of the [!INCLUDE[afproductnamelong](../../includes/afproductnamelong-md.md)]. The [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)] provides a common basis for building integration adapters that a variety of client applications such as BizTalk Server and Microsoft Office can consume. The [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)] aligns the adapter strategy with the Microsoft Services strategy by exposing integration adapters as Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) channels. For more information about the [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)], see the [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)] documentation. The documentation is installed along with the [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)], typically under \<installation drive\>:\Program Files\\[!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)]\Documents.  
  
 To perform operations on a Siebel system, adapter clients must have access to business services exposed by the Siebel system. A Siebel application exposes data as business components and business objects. A Siebel *business component* is a logical entity that associates columns from one or more tables into a single structure. A Siebel *business object* implements a business model by tying together a set of interrelated business components. With the [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel](../../includes/adaptersiebel-md.md)], adapter clients can surface Siebel business objects and business components.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)] also includes the [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersiebellong](../../includes/adoprovidersiebellong-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[adoprovidersiebelshort](../../includes/adoprovidersiebelshort-md.md)]). The [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersiebelshort](../../includes/adoprovidersiebelshort-md.md)] provides an ADO interface to a Siebel system by extending ADO.NET interfaces.  
  
 This section discusses the features of the [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)] and the [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersiebelshort](../../includes/adoprovidersiebelshort-md.md)].
