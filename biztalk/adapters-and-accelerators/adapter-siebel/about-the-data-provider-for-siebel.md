# About the Data Provider for Siebel
## Overview
The [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersiebelshort](../../includes/adoprovidersiebelshort-md.md)] is built on top of the [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel](../../includes/adaptersiebel-md.md)]. You can use the [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersiebelshort](../../includes/adoprovidersiebelshort-md.md)] to:  
  
- Write an ADO.NET client to connect to the Siebel system. The [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersiebelshort](../../includes/adoprovidersiebelshort-md.md)] exposes certain classes that enable you to interface with the provider.  
  
- Run a SELECT query on a Siebel business component
  
- Run an EXEC query on a Siebel business service
  
- Use the [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersiebelshort](../../includes/adoprovidersiebelshort-md.md)] with SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)
  
[Use  the .NET Framework Data Provider for Siebel eBusiness Applications](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-siebel/use-the-net-framework-data-provider-for-siebel-ebusiness-applications.md) is a great resource for information on:  
  
- The ADO.NET interfaces extended by the [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersiebelshort](../../includes/adoprovidersiebelshort-md.md)]  
  
- The connection string to connect to a Siebel system  
  
- Syntax for the SELECT and EXEC statements  
  
- Using the [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersiebelshort](../../includes/adoprovidersiebelshort-md.md)] with SSIS  
  
## Limitations
The following are known limitations of the [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersiebellong](../../includes/adoprovidersiebellong-md.md)]:  
  
- The [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersiebelshort](../../includes/adoprovidersiebelshort-md.md)] supports alias names for tables in the SELECT clause, but not in the WHERE clause.  
  
- The [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersiebelshort](../../includes/adoprovidersiebelshort-md.md)] fails to create a table with column names that have the special character, "]". You can escape the special character by including another closing square bracket. So, you should include"]]" instead of "]".  
  
- Due to issues with timeout handling by the underlying Siebel client API, the [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersiebelshort](../../includes/adoprovidersiebelshort-md.md)] does not support command and connection timeout.  
  
- The [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersiebelshort](../../includes/adoprovidersiebelshort-md.md)] does not support asynchronous command behavior.  
  
- When used with a SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) project, the [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersiebelshort](../../includes/adoprovidersiebelshort-md.md)] fails to retrieve data for columns that contain values with more than 8000 characters. This is due to an SSIS restriction according to which:  
  
  -   Values greater than 4000 characters in SSIS variable are not supported.  
  
  -   Values greater than 4000 wide characters are not supported.  
  
  -   Values greater than 8000 single-byte characters are not supported.  
  
- The EXEC operation will not be functional while using the [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersiebellong](../../includes/adoprovidersiebellong-md.md)] with SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS). So, for example, adapter clients will not be able to execute a business service in Siebel (using [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersiebelshort](../../includes/adoprovidersiebelshort-md.md)]) while using the data providers with SSIS.
