# Message Versioning Support

The [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel](../../includes/adaptersiebel-md.md)] supports versioning by including a version string component in the message actions, namespaces, and node IDs surfaced for operations. The current version is `http://Microsoft.LobServices.Siebel/2007/03`. This means that for an Insert operation on an Account business object in the Siebel repository, the Insert operation surfaced by the adapter has the following:  
  
- Node ID: `http://Microsoft.LobServices.Siebel/2007/03/BusinessObjects/Account/Account/Insert`  
  
- Message action: `http://Microsoft.LobServices.Siebel/2007/03/BusinessObjects/Account/Account/Insert`  
  
- Namespace: `http://Microsoft.LobServices.Siebel/2007/03/BusinessObjects/Account/Account/Operation`  
  
> [!NOTE]
> This feature does not provide backward compatibility with the earlier versions of the adapter.
