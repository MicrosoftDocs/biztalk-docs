# Run Operations on Business Components with the Siebel adapter using the WCF Service Model
You can create a WCF client that targets a Siebel business component. You can then use the WCF client to perform Insert, Update, Query, Delete, Associate, Dissociate, and child record query operations on the business component on the Siebel system. Siebel business objects are surfaced under the Business Objects node in the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservreflong](../../includes/addadapterservreflong-md.md)]. The business components that compose each business object are surfaced under the node corresponding to that object. You can follow the steps in [Overview of the WCF Service Model with the Siebel Adapter](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-siebel/overview-of-the-wcf-service-model-with-the-siebel-adapter.md) to generate a WCF client for a business component that targets specific operations and use the client to invoke these operations on the business component.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This topic provides information about performing basic operations (Insert, Update, Query, Delete) on business components. For more information about performing Associate, Dissociate, and child record query operations, see [Run Operations on Business Components with MVG Fields by Using the WCF Service Model](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-siebel/work-with-mvp-fields-using-the-siebel-adapter-and-the-wcf-service-model.md)  
  
 The following code uses a WCF client to perform Insert, Update, and Delete operations on a record in the Account business component of the Account business object. Between each operation, a Query operation is performed to verify the results. The WCF client in this example is initialized from a configuration file that is generated by the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)]. For an example of a generated configuration file, see [Configure a WCF Client for a Siebel System](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-siebel/configure-a-wcf-client-for-a-siebel-system.md).
