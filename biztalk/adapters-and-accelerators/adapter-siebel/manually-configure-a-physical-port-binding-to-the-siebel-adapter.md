# Manually configure a physical port binding to the Siebel adapter
This section provides information about configuring the [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel](../../includes/adaptersiebel-md.md)] as a WCF custom binding by using the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console. After deploying the adapter, you will be able to send and receive messages from the Siebel system by using the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration Console. The steps for deploying the adapter vary depending on the direction of communication between [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)]. You may choose to configure a Send or a Send-Receive port. Your choices are summarized in the following table:  
  
|Port direction|Communication pattern|Direction of communication to choose from|  
|---|---|---|  
|Send|One-way|I will always be sending messages on this port.|  
|Send-Receive|Request-response|I will be sending a request and receiving a response.|  
  
 For more information, see [Creating and Configuring Send Ports](../../core/creating-and-configuring-send-ports.md).
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Receive ports are not supported because the [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)] does not enable inbound operations from the Siebel system.  
> 
> [!NOTE]
>  You can also configure the WCF-Custom send ports by importing a binding configuration file that is created by the [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservshort](../../includes/consumeadapterservshort-md.md)] as part of metadata generation. For instructions on configuring ports using this binding file, see [Configure a physical port binding using a port binding file to Siebel](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-siebel/configure-a-physical-port-binding-using-a-port-binding-file-to-siebel.md).
