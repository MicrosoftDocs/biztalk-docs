# SiebelConnectionStringBuilder class in the Siebel adapter
The [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersiebelshort](../../includes/adoprovidersiebelshort-md.md)] provides a `DbConnectionStringBuilder` implementation to enable SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) and Visual Studio explorer tools environments to get the connection properties of the [!INCLUDE[adoprovidersiebelshort](../../includes/adoprovidersiebelshort-md.md)] and display them in the form of a GUI driven by the PropertyGrid.  
  
 To create a SiebelConnectionStringBuilder, use the following approach:  
  
```  
  
//In this example, factory is an instance of SiebelClientFactory  
SiebelConnectionStringBuilder bldr = (SiebelConnectionStringBuilder)factory.CreateConnectionStringBuilder();  
bldr.ConnectionString = connstr;  
```  
  
 Or, simply:  
  
```  
  
SiebelConnectionStringBuilder bldr = new SiebelConnectionStringBuilder();  
```  
  
 To see the keys and values supported as part of the `DbConnectionStringBuilder`, see [Data Provider properties for the Siebel Connection String](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-siebel/data-provider-properties-for-the-siebel-connection-string.md).
