# Configure the binding properties for Siebel
The [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)] surfaces several binding properties that enable you to control some of its behavioral characteristics. This section provides information about setting the binding properties from Visual Studio (design time) and from the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration Console (run time). At design time, you must specify the binding properties to generate schema for specific operations. At run time, you must specify the binding properties as part of the send port for sending messages to the Siebel system.  

 For information about the binding properties, including a list of binding properties for [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)], see [Read about BizTalk Adapter for Siebel Binding Properties](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-siebel/read-about-biztalk-adapter-for-siebel-binding-properties.md).  

## Enter the binding properties at design time  
 For design time, you must specify the binding properties from the [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservshort](../../includes/consumeadapterservshort-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[addadapterwiz](../../includes/addadapterwiz-md.md)] dialog box.  

#### Enter binding properties using Consume Adapter Service Add-in  

1.  Right-click your BizTalk project, point to **Add**, and then select **Add Generated Items**.  

2.  In the **Add Generated Items** dialog box, do the following:  

    |Use this|To do this|  
    |--------------|----------------|  
    |**Categories**|Click **Consume Adapter Service**.|  
    |**Templates**|Click **Consume Adapter Service**.|  

3.  To start the **Consume Adapter Service** dialog box, click **Add**.  

4.  In the **Consume Adapter Service** dialog box, from the **Select a binding** drop-down list select **siebelBinding**, and click **Configure**.  

5.  In the **Configure Adapter** dialog box, click the **Binding Properties** tab and specify the binding values, if any, which are required to be specified before generating the schema. For more information about binding properties, see [Read about BizTalk Adapter for Siebel Binding Properties](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-siebel/read-about-biztalk-adapter-for-siebel-binding-properties.md).  

6.  Click **OK**.  

#### Enter binding properties using Add Adapter Metadata Wizard  

1. Right-click your BizTalk project, point to **Add**, and then select **Add Generated Items**.  

2. In the **Add Generated Items** dialog box, do the following:  


   |    Use this    |           To do this            |
   |----------------|---------------------------------|
   | **Categories** |     Click **Add Adapter**.      |
   | **Templates**  | Click **Add Adapter Metadata**. |


3. Click **Add**. The [!INCLUDE[addadapterwiz](../../includes/addadapterwiz-md.md)] opens.  

4. In the Add Adapter Wizard, select **WCF-Siebel**. Select the computer on which [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] is installed and the name of the BizTalk database.  

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   >  If you already have a WCF-Siebel port configured in BizTalk, select the port from the **Port** list.  

5. Click **Next**.  

6. In the **Consume Adapter Service** dialog box, from the **Select a binding** drop-down list select **siebelBinding**, and click **Configure**.  

7. In the **Configure Adapter** dialog box, click the **Binding Properties** tab and specify the binding values, if any, which are required to be specified before generating the schema. For more information about binding properties, see [Read about BizTalk Adapter for Siebel Binding Properties](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-siebel/read-about-biztalk-adapter-for-siebel-binding-properties.md).  

   > [!NOTE]
   >  If you selected an existing WCF-Siebel send port, you need not specify the binding properties. The binding properties are picked from the send port configuration. However, you may choose to specify the binding properties that are required at design-time, if any. In such case, the new values for binding properties will be used at design-time while generating the metadata. However, at run-time the values specified for binding properties in the send port configuration will be applicable.  

8. Click **OK**.  

## Enter binding properties at run time  
 For run time, you must specify the binding properties as part of the WCF-Custom or the WCF-Siebel port configuration in the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console.  

#### Enter binding properties for the WCF-Custom port  

1. Start the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console.  

2. In the console tree, expand **BizTalk Group**, then expand **Applications**, and then expand the application under which you want to create a port, and then click **Send Ports**. In the right pane, you can choose to create a port or select an existing port.  

3. In the **Port Properties** dialog box, from the **Type** drop-down list, select **WCF-Custom**, and then click **Configure**.  

4. In the **WCF-Custom Transport Properties** dialog box, click the **Binding** tab.  

5. From the **Binding Type** drop-down list, select **siebelBinding**.  

6. In the **Configuration** box, specify the values for the different binding properties and click **OK**.  

#### Enter binding properties for the WCF-Siebel port  

1. Start the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console.  

2. Add the WCF-Siebel adapter to the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console. For instructions, see [Add the Siebel Adapter to BizTalk Server Administration Console](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-siebel/add-the-siebel-adapter-to-biztalk-server-administration-console.md).  

3. In the console tree, expand **BizTalk Group**, then expand **Applications**, and then expand the application under which you want to create a port, and then click **Send Ports**. In the right pane, you can choose to create a port or select an existing port.  

4. In the **Port Properties** dialog box, from the **Type** drop-down list, select the WCF-Siebel port you added earlier, and then click **Configure**.  

5. In the transport properties dialog box, click the **Binding** tab and specify values for the binding properties.  

6. Click **OK**.
