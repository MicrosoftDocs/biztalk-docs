# Run Operations on Business Components with MVG Fields with the Siebel adapter using the WCF Service Model
The [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel](../../includes/adaptersiebel-md.md)] surfaces operations to associate, dissociate, and query child records for business components that have multivalue group (MVG) fields. A sample that demonstrates how to work with MVG fields in the WCF service model is included in the samples provided with the [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)]. For more information, see [Samples for the Siebel adapter](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-siebel/samples-for-the-siebel-adapter.md).
