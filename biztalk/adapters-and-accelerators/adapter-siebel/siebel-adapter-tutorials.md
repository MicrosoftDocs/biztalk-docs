# Siebel Adapter Tutorials
The first of the [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)] tutorials contains a step-by-step demonstration of how to present data from a Siebel system on a Microsoft SharePoint portal. The second [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)] tutorial contains detailed instructions on how to migrate BizTalk projects created using the previous version of the Siebel adapter to use the WCF-based [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)].  
  
 Also, the topics in the [Developing BizTalk Server Applications](../../core/developing-biztalk-server-applications.md) section provide detailed instructions on how to use the [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)].
