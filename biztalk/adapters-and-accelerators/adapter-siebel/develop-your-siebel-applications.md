# Develop your Siebel applications

## Overview
The [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel](../../includes/adaptersiebel-md.md)] is a [!INCLUDE[firstref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/firstref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] custom binding. Client applications can consume the [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)] to invoke operations on Siebel artifacts. The [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)] can be consumed:  
  
-   Through a physical port binding in a BizTalk Server solution.  
  
-   By invoking methods on an instance of a client proxy.  
  
-   As a hosted WCF service.  
  
-   By sending SOAP messages over a channel instance in code that uses the WCF channel model.  
  
-   Through an ADO.NET interface.  
  
## BizTalk vs WCF service vs WCF channel vs ADO.NET
 The following table:  
  
- Lists the different operations that can be performed on a Siebel system using the [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)].  
  
- Indicates which of the approaches ([!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], WCF service model, WCF channel model, or ADO.NET interface) can be used to perform the operations.  
  
- Provides links to more information about performing the task using the chosen approach.
