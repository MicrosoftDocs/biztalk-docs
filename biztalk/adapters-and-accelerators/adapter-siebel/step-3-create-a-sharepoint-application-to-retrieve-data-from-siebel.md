# Step 3: Create a SharePoint Application to Retrieve Data from Siebel
![Step 3 of 4](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/media/step-3of4.gif "Step_3of4")

 **Time to complete:** 15 minutes.

 **Objective:** You must now take the application definition file you created by using the Business Data Catalog Definition Editor, and import it into Office SharePoint Server.

## Prerequisites

-   You should have created an application definition file, as described in [Step 2: Create an Application Definition File for Siebel Business Component Operations](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-siebel/step-2-create-an-application-definition-file-for-siebel-business-component.md).

-   The Microsoft Single Sign-on service must be running.

## How to Create a SharePoint Application
 Creating a SharePoint application involves the following steps:

-   Create a single sign-on (SSO) application in SharePoint

-   Create a Shared Services Provider (SSP)

-   Import the application definition file

-   Create a Web Part page, and add Web Parts

## Creating an SSO Application in SharePoint
 To access the data in a Siebel system from a SharePoint application, you must set up an SSO application that maps a SharePoint user to a Siebel user. Creating an SSO application in SharePoint involves the following steps:

1.  **Manage server settings for single sign-on**. In this step, you specify a user account that can manage and set up the single sign-on service. You can do so from the Manage Server Settings page. This option is available from the SharePoint Central Administration console. For more information about this step, refer to the “Configure Single Sign-On for Office SharePoint Server 2007” section at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=105291](/previous-versions/office/sharepoint-2007-products-and-technologies/cc262932(v=office.12)).

2.  **Manage settings for enterprise application definitions**. In this step, you configure the settings for the enterprise application definition. You can do so from the Manage Settings for Enterprise Application Definitions page. This option is available from the SharePoint Central Administration console.

    1.  On Central Administration, on the top navigation bar, click **Operations**.

    2.  On the Operations page, in the **Security Configuration** section, click  **Manage settings for single sign-on**.

    3.  On the Manage Settings for Single Sign-On page, in the **Enterprise Application Definition Settings** section, click **Manage settings for enterprise application definitions**.

    4.  On the Manage Enterprise Application Definitions page, provide values for the **Display name**, **Application name**, and the **Contact e-mail address** fields.

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        >  For the **Application name** field, make sure you specify the same SSO application name that you specified for the **SecondarySsoApplicationId** variable while creating the application definition file, as described in [Step 2: Create an Application Definition File for Siebel Business Component Operations](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-siebel/step-2-create-an-application-definition-file-for-siebel-business-component.md).

    5.  Leave the other fields as default, and click **OK**.

3.  **Manage account information for enterprise application definitions**. In this step, you enable individual users or groups to connect to an enterprise application from SharePoint. Essentially, in this step you map an individual user or group to a user in the LOB system. You also specify the credentials to connect to the LOB system. You can do so from Manage Account Information for Enterprise Application Definitions page. This option is available from the SharePoint Central Administration console. For more information about this step, refer to the “Manage account information for an enterprise application definition” section at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=105291](/previous-versions/office/sharepoint-2007-products-and-technologies/cc262932(v=office.12)).

## Creating a Shared Services Provider
 An SSP is a logical grouping of shared services and their supporting resources. You can create an SSP using the SharePoint Central Administration console.

 You must define a Web site while creating an SSP. Remember the port number and the site address you create. You will import the Business Data Catalog application definition to this site.

 For more information about creating an SSP, see "Chapter overview: Create and configure Shared Services Providers" at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=105119](/previous-versions/office/sharepoint-2007-products-and-technologies/cc262914(v=office.12)).

## Importing the Application Definition File
 You must now import the application definition file into the SSP.

#### To import the application definition file

1. Start SharePoint 3.0 Central Administration. Click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to **Microsoft Office Server**, and then click **SharePoint 3.0 Central Administration**.

2. In the left navigation pane, click the name of the SSP to which you want to import the application definition.

3. In the **Business Data Catalog** section, click **Import application definition**.

4. On the Import Application Definition page that opens, browse to Siebel_Account.xml, select the file, and then click **Open**.

5. Click **Import**.

6. Click **OK**.

   After importing the application, you can see your application by going to the **View Applications** link. Click the application name to see the entities in the application.

## Creating Web Parts
 You must now create Web Parts in your SharePoint site to view and manage the business data that will be extracted from the Siebel system. Web Parts are reusable components that can contain any kind of Web-based information, including analytical, collaborative, and database information.

 In this tutorial, Web Parts are created for the method instances that were created in Business Data Catalog Definition Editor. Office SharePoint Server provides different kinds of Web Parts for specific use. For the Finder method instance, we will use the **Business Data List** Web Part. This Web Part enables you to specify a search expression to perform a query on the Account business component. For this tutorial, we call this the **Query Accounts** Web Part.

 This section provides instructions to create these Web Parts. For more information about creating Web Parts, see the Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 document ("Customize business data lists, Web Parts, and sites") at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=104131](/previous-versions/office/sharepoint-2007-products-and-technologies/cc263201(v=office.12)).

 The Web Parts will be added to a single Web Part page. You must create a Web Part page before adding the Web Parts. For this tutorial, the Web Part page is called **Siebel Account**.

### Creating a Web Part Page
 This section provides instructions to create a Web Part page.

##### To create a web part page

1. Start SharePoint 3.0 Central Administration. Click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to **Microsoft Office Server**, and click **SharePoint 3.0 Central Administration**.

2. In the left navigation pane, click the name of the SSP to which you want to import the application definition.

3. On the Shared Services Administration page, from the top right-hand corner, click **Site Actions**, and then click **Create**.
