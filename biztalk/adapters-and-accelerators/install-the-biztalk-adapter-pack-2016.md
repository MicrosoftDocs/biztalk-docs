# How to install the BizTalk Adapter Pack 2016
## Overview

The [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion_md](../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)] (BAP) is included with [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion_md](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)]. So when you download [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion_md](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], you are also downloading the adapters in the [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion_md](../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)]. 

The [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion_md](../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)] uses the [!INCLUDE[firstref_btsWinCommFoundation_md](../includes/firstref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] to communicate with different enterprise line-of-business (LOB) systems. The [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion_md](../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)] has its own set of requirements, its own setup experience, and its own installation steps. 

The [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion_md](../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)] is optional, and is only needed if you want [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion_md](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] to send or receive messages to any of the following enterprise LOB systems: 

* Oracle Database
* Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS)
* SAP
* SQL Server
* Siebel

Every version of [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion_md](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] includes its own [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion_md](../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)] version. Only the version included with your [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion_md](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] version is supported. They are not backward-compatible.

This document lists the software requirements, and the steps to install the Microsoft BizTalk Adapter Pack (BAP) included with [!INCLUDE[bts2016_md](../includes/bts2016-md.md)].
