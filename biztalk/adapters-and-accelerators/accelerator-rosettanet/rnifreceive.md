# RNIFReceive
This sample provides a working MicrosoftÂ® [!INCLUDE[BTARN_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/btarn-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] RNIFReceive.aspx file that receives an RNIF message, and prepares it for processing by the [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] public process. You can customize the ASPX page to do the following:  
  
- Add or remove performance counters  
  
- Add functionality to the page, such as writing data to a database or customizing tracking functionality  
  
- Add validation to the page  
  
  This sample is located in *\<drive\>*:\Program Files\Microsoft BizTalk \<version\> Accelerator for RosettaNet\SDK\WebApplication\RNIFReceiver.
