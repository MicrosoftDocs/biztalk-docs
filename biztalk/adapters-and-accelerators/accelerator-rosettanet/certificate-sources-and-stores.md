# Certificate Sources and Stores
This topic describes where to import certificates from, and where to store certificates.  
  
## Certificate Sources  
 You import certificates from the following files:  
  
- Private certificates from .pfx or .p12 files. After importing the certificates, store these files securely. If you import the private certificates using the CertWizard utility, you can set the **/Exportable** switch to `False`, which is the default setting, so that the private certificates cannot be exported from the store into a file. If you set the **/Exportable** switch to `True`, you can export these certificates to a file from the Certificates Microsoft Management Console (MMC).  
  
- Public certificates from .cer or .der files. Partners send their certificates to you in these files.  
  
- Root certificates from .cer or .der files. Certification authorities send their root certificates to you in these files.  
  
## Certificate Storage  
 You import certificates into one of two Certificates stores on the local computer. You store public certificates in the **Certificates (Local Computer)** store. You can open the nodes of this store by opening the **Certificates (Local Computer)** node in the Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btaBTARNNoVersion](../../includes/btabtarnnoversion-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)]) Management Console. You can access the **Certificates (Local Computer)** store if you have administrative permissions on the computer. Store public certificates in the following folders:  
  
- Home public certificates in the Personal folder in the **Certificates (Local Computer)** store  
  
- Partner public certificates in the Other People folder of the **Certificates (Local Computer)** store  
  
- Certificates from certification authorities in the Trusted Root Certification Authority folder of the **Certificates (Local Computer)** store  
  
  You store private certificates in the **Certificates - Current User** store. You can open the nodes of this store by opening the Management Console using the **runas** command with the host service account user.
