# RosettaNet and CIDX Messaging Standards
The primary purpose of MicrosoftÂ® [!INCLUDE[BTARN_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/btarn-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] is to process messages that conform to the RosettaNet or Chemical Industry Data Exchange (CIDX) messaging standards. This section provides information about the two major RosettaNet standards: the RosettaNet Implementation Framework (RNIF) and Partner Interface Processes (PIPs). It also provides information about the CIDX Chem eStandards.

 The RosettaNet standards are an emerging, widely accepted set of standards for implementing automated message exchange in high-technology scenarios. The purpose of the RosettaNet organization is to create, implement, and promote eBusiness process standards. These standards are widely used in high-technology manufacturing and supply-chain applications. The six different industry councils that govern the RosettaNet organization demonstrate the breadth of the application:

- Electronic components

- Semiconductor manufacturers

- Information technology

- Telecommunications

- Logistics

- Solution providers

  The CIDX Chem eStandards are a widely accepted set of standards for implementing automated message exchange in chemical-industry scenarios.

  For more information about standards, see the [GS1 RosettaNet website](https://www.gs1us.org/resources/rosettanet) and the [CIDX website](https://oagi.org/pages/chem-estandards).
