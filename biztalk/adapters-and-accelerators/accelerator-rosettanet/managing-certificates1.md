# Managing Certificates for BizTalk Accelerator for RosettaNet (BTARN)

Secure communications in RosettaNet require using certificates. MicrosoftÂ® [!INCLUDE[BTARN_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/btarn-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] uses certificates to encrypt outgoing messages, sign outgoing messages, decrypt incoming messages, and verify the signature in incoming messages.  
  
 To use certificates, you must perform some or all of the following steps:  
  
-   Import certificates into the certificates store for the server  
  
-   Configure the use of certificates in messages  
  
-   Export certificates to partners
