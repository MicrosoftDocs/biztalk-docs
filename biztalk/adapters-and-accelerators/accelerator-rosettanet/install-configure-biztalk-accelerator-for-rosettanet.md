> [!TIP]
> The hardware requirements listed are the minimum. Every environment is different and there's a very good chance that your environment may need more. See [Recommendations for Installing, Sizing, Deploying, and Maintaining a BizTalk Server Solution](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/666.recommendations-for-installing-sizing-deploying-and-maintaining-a-biztalk-server-solution.aspx).

## Install and configure

### Before you begin

* For the BTARN database, BTARN only configures the SQL Server computer name and database name properties. Information about these properties is stored in the registry.
* Sign in using an account that is a member of the BizTalk Server Administrators group.
* In your BizTalk Server download, the BTARN setup is in the `\BizTalk Accelerators` folder.
* BizTalk Server must be installed, and SQL Server must be running.
* Both BTARN and BizTalk Server require Microsoft .NET Framework as software prerequisite. If you have multiple versions of .NET Framework installed on your computer, make sure that the BtarnAPP Web application is referencing .NET Framework 4.0 classic. You can configure this by using the Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager.
* The BizTalk Host Instance Account and the BizTalk Isolated Host Instance Account should be the same. Otherwise, BTARN does not function correctly.
* BTARN allows you to add only individual service accounts, and not groups, to the BizTalk Server Administrators group or the BizTalk Application Users group.
* You need to create a WebService extension for BTSHTTPReceive.dll, configuring the IIS isolation mode. For more information, see the "404 Not found error when sending a HTTP request" entry in the "Troubleshooting: Issues and Resolutions" topic at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=188560](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=188560). Also, see [How to Configure IIS for an HTTP Receive Location](../../core/how-to-configure-iis-for-an-http-receive-location.md).
* Add your server (http://<*server name*>) to the Local Internet zone in the Internet Explorer security options.
*  If a remote SQL instance using non default port is used for configuring BTARN, then the SQL Server Client Tools must be installed locally. For details, see [BizTalk Server Installation Guide for multicomputer environment](../../install-and-config-guides/install-biztalk-server-in-a-multi-computer-environment.md).
*  A separate group must be used for role - BizTalk Administrator, BizTalk Host Users, and BizTalk Isolated Host Users during the configuration of BizTalk Server.
*  BTARN does not support the use of alias created for SQL instance to configure the BTARN database.

### Install BTARN

1.  Run the BTARN **setup.exe** as Administrator.

2.  Select **Install**.

3.  On the **Customer Information** page, type your user name, organization, and the product key, and then click **Next**.

4.  On the **License Agreement** page, read the End User License Agreement, and then click **Accept**.

    > [!NOTE]
    >  If you do not accept the license agreement, you cannot continue with the installation.

5.  On the **Installation Options** page, select **Complete** for a full installation or **Custom** for a partial installation. Ensure the installation path is correct, and then click **Next**.

    > [!NOTE]
    >  If you select **Custom**, select the components to install from the **Custom Installation** page. If you select to install SDK or Documentation components only, you must have .NET Framework installed before running the setup program.

6.  On the **Summary** page, review the components you are installing, and then click **Install**. The **Installation Progress** screen displays the progress of the installation procedure.

7.  On the **Installation Completed** page, ensure the **Run Configuration Wizard** box is selected, and then click **Finish**.

     The BTARN Configuration Wizard opens. Next, you configure BTARN.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >  If you perform a custom installation to install only the BTARN HTTP Front End feature, BTARN configuration may fail after setup is complete, displaying the "Failed to create object for feature: WebApp" error. If this occurs, copy two files (**Microsoft.VC80.ATL.manifest** and **atl80.dll**) from a computer with BizTalk Server installed on it, to the computer where you installed the BTARN HTTP Front End feature.
    >
    >  If Visual Studio is installed on the same computer as BizTalk Server, the source folder for the two files is *<drive\>*:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\VC\redist\x86\Microsoft.VC100.ATL. If Visual Studio is not installed on the BizTalk server, the source folder for the two files on the BizTalk server is a folder under *<drive\>*:\WINDOWS\WinSxS. The version of the files should be 8.0.50727.42. The destination folder on the computer where you have installed the HTTP Front End feature is the BTARN installation directory (by default, *<drive\>*:\Program Files\Microsoft BTARN).
    >
    >  After you have copied these files to the computer with the HTTP Front End feature installed, rerun **Configuration.exe**.

### Configure BTARN

> [!TIP]
 >  Before configuring BTARN, make sure you map .NET Framework under Handler Mappings in IIS. Also, when configuring BTARN, you may need to create the IIS_WPG group manually.

1.  On the **Microsoft BTARN Configuration Wizard** page, select **Basic configuration** to configure the server with default settings, or **Custom configuration** to configure the server using advanced configuration options.

    > [!NOTE]
    >  If you want to configure BTARN using a local administrator account, enter the account as *<machine name\>\\<administrator name\>* in the **User ID** field of the **Service Credential** area.

2.  In the **Database server name** text box, verify that the server name displayed is correct. In the **Service credential** area, enter the user name (with domain) and password for the account that the services will run under. Click **Configure**.

3.  If your account has administrative privileges, click **Yes** to proceed with the configuration.

4.  If you selected **Basic configuration** in step 1, verify the list of components to be configured in the **Summary** dialog box, and then click **Next**. Go to step 10.

5.  If you selected **Custom configuration** in step 1, perform the following steps:

    > [!NOTE]
    >  BTARN configuration will fail if you use a special character in the name of any of the BTARN databases.

6.  To configure the runtime, in the **Microsoft BTRAN Configuration** dialog box, click **Runtime** in the left pane. In the right **Runtime** pane, click **Enable the Runtime feature on this computer**. To join an existing database group, clear **Do you want to create a new database group**. Select the appropriate Web server name, port number, data stores, Application Pool service account, and BizTalk HTTP Receive virtual folder.

7.  To configure the WebApps feature, in the **Microsoft BTRAN Configuration** dialog box, click **WebApps** in the left pane, and then click **Enable the Runtime feature on this computer**. Enter the appropriate BizTalk Server name and port number, or select the defaults. Select the appropriate Web application virtual folder.

8.  Click **Apply Configuration**.

9. On the **Summary** page, click **Next**.

10. On the **Configuration Completed** page, click **Finish**.

    > [!NOTE]
    >  After you install BTARN, your system administrator must add users to the BAS Business User, Business Manager, and Business Administrator groups. If you are a system administrator, you will have to populate these groups and log off, and then log in adding yourself to the groups.

    > [!WARNING]
    >  Three different groups must be used while configuring BizTalk Server for BizTalk Administrator, BizTalk Host Users, and BizTalk Isolated Host Users.

## Start the artifacts
The BTARN orchestrations, send ports, and receive locations are not automatically started after you configure BTARN.

> [!NOTE]
>  Start the PrivateInitiator_To_LOB and PrivateResponder_To_LOB send ports before you can start the PrivateInitiatorProcess and PrivateResponderProcess orchestrations.

-   On computers where you have configured an Internet Information Services (IIS) virtual server with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), you must configure the virtual server to accept the client certificate. See [Step 4: Enabling Secure Sockets Layer in IIS](step-4-enabling-secure-sockets-layer-in-iis.md) in the [Double Action Tutorial](double-action-tutorial.md).


1.  Open **BizTalk Server Administration** as an administrator.

2.  Expand **BizTalk Group**, expand **Applications**, and then expand **BizTalk Application 1**.

3.  Click **Send Ports**. In the right pane, for each send port that is not started, right-click and then click **Start**.

4.  Click **Receive Ports** and **Receive Locations**. In the right pane, for each receive location that is not started, right-click and then click **Start**.

    > [!NOTE]
    >  You must start the PrivateInitiator_To_LOB and PrivateResponder_To_LOB send ports before you can start the PrivateInitiatorProcess and PrivateResponderProcess orchestrations.

5.  Click **Orchestrations** and **Receive Locations**. In the right pane, for each orchestration that is not started, right-click and then click **Start**.

## Restart your computer

Restart your computer to apply any modifications made in configuration and permissions.

> [!NOTE]
>  Developers may choose to install and configure BTARN on a single server for development, staging, or testing purposes. Developers use this server to write their own custom code and test it before moving it to production.

 For more information about installing BTARN on a single server, see the [Loopback Tutorial](loopback-tutorial.md).
