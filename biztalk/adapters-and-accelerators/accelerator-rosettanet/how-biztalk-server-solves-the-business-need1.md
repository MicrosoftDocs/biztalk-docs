# How BizTalk Server Solves the Business Need

To solve your system integration needs, MicrosoftÂ® [!INCLUDE[BTARN_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/btarn-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] enhances the functionality of MicrosoftBizTalk Server for high-technology manufacturing systems. Because the [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] Setup program installs the accelerator on top of BizTalk Server, this section describes the technology by providing an overview of the functionality of BizTalk Server, and a description of the functionality that [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] adds to BizTalk Server.
