# Step 3: Defining, Publishing, and Deploying the Business Policy for Contoso
In this step, you create a business policy that reserves a set quantity of units for each product that Contoso manufactures to be used in case of an emergency.  
  
### To add a new policy  
  
1.  In the Business Rule Composer, in the Policy Explorer pane, right-click **Policies**, and then click **Add New Policy**.  
  
2.  Name the new policy **3A2PriceAvailabilityPolicy**, and then press **Enter**.  
  
### To add a policy rule to enforce the emergency quantity needs  
  
1.  Right-click **Version 1.0 (not saved)** under **3A2PriceAvailabilityPolicy**, and then click **Add New Rule**.  
  
2.  Name the rule **Emergency Supply Rule - Quantity Exhausted**, and then press **Enter**.  
  
3.  In the Business Rule Composer, in the right pane, right-click **Conditions** under the IF pane, point to **Predicates**, and then click the **Less than equal** predicate.  
  
4.  In the Facts Explorer pane, expand **Vocabularies**, expand **3A2PriceAvailabilityVocabulary**, expand **Version 1.0 - Published**, select **Quantity Available**, and drag it onto the `argument1` placeholder on the composer surface.  
  
5.  Repeat step 4 by dragging **Emergency Quantity Needed** onto the `argument2` placeholder.  
  
6.  Select **Final Quantity Available**, and then drag it onto **Actions** in the THEN pane.  
  
### To add a policy to revise the Number Available field in the response  
  
1.  Right-click **Version 1.0 (not saved)** under **3A2PriceAvailabilityPolicy**, and then click **Add New Rule**.  
  
2.  Name the new rule **Emergency Supply Rule - Quantity Available**, and then press **Enter**.  
  
3.  In the Business Rule Composer, in the right pane, right click **Conditions** under the IF pane, point to **Predicates**, and then click the **Greater than** predicate.  
  
4.  In the Facts Explorer pane, expand **Vocabularies**, expand **3A2PriceAvailabilityVocabulary**, expand **Version 1.0 - Published**, select **Quantity Available**, and then drag it onto the `argument1` placeholder on the composer surface.  
  
5.  Repeat that same step by dragging **Emergency Quantity Needed** onto the `argument2` placeholder.  
  
6.  Select **Final Quantity Available**, and then drag it onto **Actions** in the THEN pane.  
  
7.  In the Facts Explorer pane, expand **Version 1.0 - Published** under **Functions**, and drag the `Subtract` function onto the **0** argument next to **Final Quantity Available** in the THEN pane.  
  
8.  Drag **Quantity Available** (under **3A2PriceAvailabilityVocabulary**) and drop it on the `value1` placeholder in the THEN pane.  
  
9. Drag **Emergency Quantity Needed**, and drop it on the `value2` placeholder in the THEN pane.  
  
### To save, publish, and deploy the business policy  
  
1.  In the Policy Explorer pane, right-click **Version 1.0 (not saved)** under **3A2PriceAvailabilityPolicy**, and then click **Save**.  
  
2.  Right-click that same node, and then click **Publish**.  
  
3.  Right-click that same node, and then click **Deploy**.
