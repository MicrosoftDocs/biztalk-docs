# Working with PIPs
The topics in this section describe how to work with Partner Interface Processes (PIPs). PIPs define business processes between trading partners, providing common business-process definitions for all RosettaNet message exchanges. PIPs specify the service content of messages.  
  
 For more information about PIPs, see [PIP Implementation](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-rosettanet/pip-implementation.md).
