# Double Action Tutorial
This tutorial covers an end-to-end solution using [!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)]® [!INCLUDE[BTARN_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/btarn-currentversion-firstref-md.md)]. The tutorial details the steps that you have to follow to implement a RosettaNet-compliant solution by creating a trading partner scenario between two fictitious companies: Contoso, the supplier organization, and Fabrikam, the buyer organization.  
  
 This tutorial uses four different Partner Interface Processes (PIPs):  
  
- 0C2 - Asynchronous Test Request  
  
- 0C4 - Synchronous Test Query  
  
- 3A2 - Request Price and Availability  
  
- 3A4 - Request Purchase Order  
  
  This tutorial addresses several distinct areas of a RosettaNet-based solution, including working with the [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] Management Console, creating line-of-business (LOB) applications, and creating custom orchestrations that you can use to integrate Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems.
