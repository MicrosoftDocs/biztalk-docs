# Generating and Enabling Certificates
This tutorial uses certificates to sign and encrypt messages sent by the Contoso and Fabrikam organizations. If you have already completed the Double Action Tutorial, you may skip this step and move on to [Creating the Contoso Solution](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-rosettanet/creating-the-contoso-solution.md). To generate and use certificates for this tutorial, follow the procedures in the following topics:  
  
-   [Step 1: Creating a Certification Authority](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-rosettanet/step-1-creating-a-certification-authority.md)  
  
-   [Step 2: Creating Public and Private Certificates](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-rosettanet/step-2-creating-public-and-private-certificates.md)  
  
-   [Step 3: Importing Public and Private Certificates](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-rosettanet/step-3-importing-public-and-private-certificates.md)  
  
-   [Step 4: Enabling Secure Sockets Layer in IIS](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-rosettanet/step-4-enabling-secure-sockets-layer-in-iis.md)  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  These steps are in the Double Action Tutorial. After completing each step, return to this topic to continue the Private Process Tutorial.
