# Creating or Editing an Agreement
This topic describes how to create or edit a trading partner agreement. A trading partner agreement configures the relationship between two trading partners, including their identities; the Partner Interface Process (PIP); the action, signal, and sync URLs; and the associated protocols.  

 A trading partner agreement includes the settings for a process configuration, home organization, partner, and agreement. All these settings are required for an agreement. You can create a process configuration based on either a RosettaNet PIP or a custom schema, but you must create the configuration. You must also define both a home organization and a partner organization. [!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[BTARN_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/btarn-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] does not support message exchange between unknown parties.  

 [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] processes and validates a message based on all of these settings. For example, for a CIDX message, [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] validates based on the RosettaNet Implementation Framework (RNIF) version (1.1 only), 0A1 agreement (No 0A1 only), and `Is Single Action` property (single-action only). A CIDX message will validate only if you set the RNIF version to "1.1", the 0A1 agreement to "No 0A1", and the `Is Single Action` property to `True`. [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] also validates that any agreement properties are consistent with process configuration profile settings. For example, it will verify that you have set the `Standard` property of the profile to "CIDX", and that the 0A1 agreement property of the agreement is set to "No 0A1".  

 If you change an agreement while a process is active, you may encounter unpredictable results. The changes to the agreement properties will apply as soon as you click **Apply** or **OK** to accept them, but you cannot predict which stage of a process is running. After you change the agreement, any new activity in a current process or any new process will use the changed agreement properties. However, a process running when you change the agreement may have already used the previous agreement properties for a message that it is processing.  

 After creating an agreement, you must activate it to enable messages associated with the agreement to be sent or received. You can also deactivate an agreement to prevent any messages associated with the agreement from being sent or received. You must deactivate an agreement to edit it, and then reactivate it after editing.  

 [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] saves this information in the TPAConfig table in the BTARNCONFIG database.  

 The settings in the trading partner agreement are as shown in the following table, arranged by tab. The default settings are the most typically used values. Procedures for creating and editing these settings appear after the table.

This is the Acceptance Acknowledgment Required custom property. This applies to RNIF 1.1 only. Set this to **false** (which is not case-sensitive) to require only a receipt acknowledgment, not an acceptance acknowledgment. If **AAR** is set to anything other than **false**, then the responder public process must send an acceptance acknowledgment, and the initiator public process will expect an acceptance acknowledgment. If AAR is set to false, the public processes will complete after the receipt acknowledgment.<br /><br /> - **HPCC**. This is the Home Partner Classification Code. This applies to RNIF 1.1 only. This enables you to set the GlobalPartnerClassificationCode element for the home partner in the service header of an outgoing message to the entry in the Value column. This value overrides the Home organization classification property in the Home Organization configuration. Use this custom property when the home organization can have more than one classification.<br /><br /> - **PPCC**. This is the Partner Profile Classification Code. This applies to RNIF 1.1 only. This enables you to set the GlobalPartnerClassificationCode element for the partner in the service header of an outgoing message to the entry in the Value column. This value overrides the Partner classification property in the Partner configuration. Use this custom property when the partner can have more than one classification. |
