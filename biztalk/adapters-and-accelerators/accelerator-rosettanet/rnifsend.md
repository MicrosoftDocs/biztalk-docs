This sample provides a working [!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)]Â® [!INCLUDE[BTARN_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/btarn-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] RNIFSend.aspx file that prepares a message for RNIF processing, and sends the message to the RNIFReceive.aspx page at the responder.
