# RNIFSend
This sample provides a working MicrosoftÂ® [!INCLUDE[BTARN_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/btarn-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] RNIFSend.aspx file that prepares a message for RNIF processing, and sends the message to the RNIFReceive.aspx page at the responder. You can customize the ASPX page to do the following:  
  
- Add or remove performance counters  
  
- Add functionality to the page, such as writing data to a database or customizing tracking functionality  
  
- Add validation to the page  
  
  This sample is located in *\<drive\>*:\Program Files\Microsoft BizTalk \<version\> Accelerator for RosettaNet\SDK\WebApplication\RNIFSender.
