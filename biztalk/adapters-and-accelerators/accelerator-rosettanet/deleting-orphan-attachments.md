# Deleting Orphan Attachments
Microsoft [!INCLUDE[BTARN_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/btarn-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] stores attachments for received messages. In certain circumstances, [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] saves the attachment, but deletes the associated message from the MessagesToLOB table, resulting in an orphan attachment. This can occur when you submit a message that has an attachment and has a manifest that is not valid, for example, a manifest in which NumberOfAttachments = 0. Periodically, you may want to delete orphan attachments to maintain system performance.  
  
## How to Delete Orphan Attachments  
 [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] stores attachments in the Attachments table of the BTARNDATA database. [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] stores the associated messages in the MessagesToLOB table. An orphan attachment results when the attachment has an `outMessageID` property that does not correspond to the `MessageID` property of a message in the MessagesToLOB table.  
  
 Periodically, you may want to delete attachments from the table by using a stored procedure that deletes only those attachments that do not have a corresponding message in the MessagesToLOB table. A sample SQL statement for the stored procedure is:  
  
```  
delete from attachments where outMessageID not in (select messageid from messagestolob)  
```  
  
 Additionally, it is recommended that you delete attachments that are older than a certain period, and do not require any more investigation. The Attachments table contains a `TimeCreated` property that you can use to delete old attachments. This process is similar to the process used to delete old digests. For a sample SQL statement for a stored procedure that deletes old digests, see [Deleting Digests](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-rosettanet/deleting-digests.md).  
  
 It is also recommended that you index the Attachments and MessagestoLOB tables on the respective MessageID columns.
