# RNIF Pipelines
The Microsoft [!INCLUDE[BTARN_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/btarn-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] receive and send pipelines perform the processing required for receive or send RosettaNet Implementation Framework (RNIF) messages. This processing includes preprocessing, decoding/encoding, decrypting/encrypting, disassembly/assembly, and party authentication.  
  
## Pipeline Files  
 Standard [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] receive and send pipelines do not process RNIF messages natively. [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] has added custom receive and send pipelines for this purpose. These pipelines are built on the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] pipelines, but add [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)]-specific processing capability. The [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] pipelines (RNIFReceive.btp and RNIFSend.btp) are available in the [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] SDK at \<*drive*\>:\Microsoft BizTalk \<version\> Accelerator for RosettaNet\SDK\RNPipelines. This lets you customize them for your own purposes.
