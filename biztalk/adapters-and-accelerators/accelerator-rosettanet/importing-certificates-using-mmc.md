# Importing Certificates Using MMC
This topic describes how to import a digital certificate that [!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[BTARN_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/btarn-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] uses to authenticate a trading partner, decrypt an incoming message, or encrypt or sign an outgoing message.  
  
 This procedure uses the Certificates snap-in for the [!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)] Management Console (MMC). This manual process imports a certificate into the certificate store, requiring you to configure certificate use separately. You can also import a certificate by using the CertWizard utility that automatically configures certificate use for you.  
  
 To import private certificates, you must use the user accounts under which the BizTalk Hosts run.  
  
### To import a public-key certificate  
  
1.  Copy the public-key (.cer) certificate file to a location on the hard disk of the server to which you are copying certificates.  
  
2.  Click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to **Microsoft** [!INCLUDE[btaBTARNNoVersionui](../../includes/btabtarnnoversionui-md.md)], and then click [!INCLUDE[btaBTARNNoVersionui](../../includes/btabtarnnoversionui-md.md)] **Management Console**.  
  
3.  In the [!INCLUDE[btaBTARNNoVersion](../../includes/btabtarnnoversion-md.md)] Management Console, expand **Certificates (Local Computer)**. The logged-in user must have administrative permissions to the computer.  
  
4.  Right-click **Other People**, point to **All Tasks**, and then click **Import**.  
  
5.  On the **Certificate Import Wizard Welcome** page, click **Next**.  
  
6.  On the **File to Import** page, click **Browse** and locate the folder that contains the certificate files. Select the file from which you want to import the certificate, and then click **Open**.  
  
7.  On the **Certificate store** page, select either **Automatically select the certificate based on the type of certificate** or **Place all certificates in the following store**. If you select **Place all certificates in the following store**, click **Browse**, select the certificate store, click **OK**, and then click **Next**.  
  
8.  Click **Finish**.  
  
### To import a private-key certificate  
  
1.  Copy private-key (.pfx) certificate files to a location on the hard disk of the server to which you are copying certificates.  
  
2.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **run as /user:\<host service\> mmc**, and then click **OK**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  For \<*host service*\>, type the name of the service that was automatically selected for the host service when you installed [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)].  
  
3.  Type the password for \<*host service*\>, and then press **Enter**.  
  
4.  In [!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)] Management Console, on the **File** menu, click **Add/Remove Snap-in**.  
  
5.  In the Add/Remove Snap-in dialog box, click **Add**.  
  
6.  In the Add Standalone Snap-in dialog box, select **Certificates**, click **Add**, click **Close**, and then click **OK**.  
  
7.  In [!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)] Management Console, expand **Certificates - Current User**, right-click **Personal**, point to **All Tasks**, and then click **Import**.  
  
8.  On the **Certificate Import Wizard Welcome** page, click **Next**.  
  
9. On the **File to Import** page, click **Browse** and locate the folder that contains the .pfx certificate file that contains the certificate that you want to import. Select the appropriate file, and then click **Open**.  
  
10. On the **Password** page, in the **Password** box, type the password for the private-key file.  
  
11. Select **Enable strong private key protection** or **Mark this key as exportable**, and then click **Next**.  
  
12. On the **Certificate store** page, select either **Automatically select the certificate based on the type of certificate** or **Place all certificates in the following store**. If you select **Place all certificates in the following store**, click **Browse**, select the store, click **OK**, and then click **Next**.  
  
13. On the **Completing the Certificate Import Wizard** page, click **Finish**.
