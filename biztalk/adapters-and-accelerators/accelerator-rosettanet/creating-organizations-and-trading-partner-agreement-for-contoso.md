# Creating Organizations and Trading Partner Agreement for Contoso
In this section, you add the necessary organization information using the BizTalk Accelerator for RosettaNet Management Console. After you add the contact information for both organizations, the final step is to set up a trading partner agreement for the 3A2 Partner Interface Process (PIP). If you completed the steps in the Double Action Tutorial, then you have already performed the necessary steps. You can move to [Creating the Contoso LOB Schemas and Maps](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-rosettanet/creating-the-contoso-lob-schemas-and-maps.md). To create the organizations and the trading partner agreement, see the following:  
  
-   [Step 1: Creating the Contoso Home Organization](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-rosettanet/step-1-creating-the-contoso-home-organization.md)  
  
-   [Step 2: Creating the Fabrikam Partner Organization](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-rosettanet/step-2-creating-the-fabrikam-partner-organization.md)  
  
-   [Step 5: Creating the Contoso 3A2 Trading Partner Agreement](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-rosettanet/step-5-creating-the-contoso-3a2-trading-partner-agreement.md)  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  These steps are in the Double Action Tutorial. After completing each step, return to this topic to continue the Private Process Tutorial.
