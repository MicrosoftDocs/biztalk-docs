# Tracking Sample
The Tracking User Interface sample shows how to create a [!INCLUDE[btsDotNet](../../includes/btsdotnet-md.md)]-based Web application to display the current status of messages and processes in Microsoft [!INCLUDE[BTARN_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/btarn-currentversion-firstref-md.md)]. The application presents the user with a form that contains several search criteria. When the user performs a search, the Tracking sample generates a detailed list showing the messages and processes in [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] that fit those criteria.

 This sample is available as a download from the Microsoft website [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)].
