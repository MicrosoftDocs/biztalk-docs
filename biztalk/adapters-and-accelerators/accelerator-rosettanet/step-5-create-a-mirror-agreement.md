# Step 5: Create a Mirror Agreement
In this step, you use the Loopback utility to create a mirror agreement simulating the trading partner on the same computer on which you configured the home organization. The Loopback utility is a command-line tool.  
  
### To create a mirror agreement using the Loopback utility  
  
1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **cmd**, and then click **OK**.  
  
2.  At the command prompt, move to \<*drive*\>:\Program Files\Microsoft BizTalk \<version\> Accelerator for RosettaNet\SDK. Type the following command and then press **Enter**:  
  
    ```  
    Loopback /enable HOME  
    ```  
  
3.  After the command executed in step 2 has completed, type the following command in the command prompt, and then press **Enter**:  
  
    ```  
    Loopback /mirror "Trade Agreement"   
    ```  
  
 The Loopback utility automatically creates send ports for the home organization (initiator) and a mirror trade agreement for the partner organization. The partner uses the two new send ports to communicate with the home organization.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You must re-mirror the trade agreement whenever you update the original trade agreement.
