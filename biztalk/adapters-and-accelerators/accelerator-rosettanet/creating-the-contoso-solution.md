# Creating the Contoso Solution
This section details the steps that you have to follow for the Contoso organization. The first step is to add the contact information and partner agreements for the two organizations using the [!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)]® [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] Management Console. You then create line-of-business (LOB) schemas, and construct a mapping between those schemas and their respective RosettaNet-based Partner Interface Process (PIP) schemas. Next, you configure port information using the SQL adapter for communicating with the ERP system, and the HTTP adapter for sending information to Fabrikam. The last step is to customize the private process orchestration to use the Business Rule Engine (BRE) in BizTalk Server.
