# Creating and Modifying the Private Process for Contoso
You can perform additional tasks with RosettaNet-based messages when implementing your solution by customizing the private process within [!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)]® [!INCLUDE[BTARN_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/btarn-currentversion-firstref-md.md)]. This section demonstrates how to customize the private process by using the Business Rule Engine (BRE) to create policies and BizTalk Editor to customize the private process orchestration.  
  
## In This Section
