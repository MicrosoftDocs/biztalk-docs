# How to Create or Edit a Process Configuration
This topic describes how to create or edit a process configuration.  

 The settings in the process configuration are as shown in the following table, arranged by tab. Procedures for creating and editing a process configuration appear after the table.  

 The authorization and non-repudiation properties are interdependent. For more information about how to set these properties, see [Authorization and Non-Repudiation Properties](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-rosettanet/authorization-and-non-repudiation-properties.md).

This can correspond either to the RosettaNet PIP designation or to the name for a custom schema. It is recommended that you use a standard naming convention, such as a name including the process code and the version, for example, "STD_3A2_R02.00.00A". This will make it easier for you to maintain different versions of the same PIP.<br /><br /> Required field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
