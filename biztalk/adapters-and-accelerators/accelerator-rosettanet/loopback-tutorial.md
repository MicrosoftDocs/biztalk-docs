# Loopback Tutorial
This tutorial contains detailed steps that describe how you can use MicrosoftÂ® [!INCLUDE[BTARN_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/btarn-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] to simulate a process implementation between the home and partner organization on a single computer.  
  
 In a real production environment, your partner organization implementation resides on a remote computer. This tutorial uses the Loopback utility to create a mirror trading agreement to simulate the trading partner on the same computer. Using a single computer loop-back scenario works for development and test purposes. It is recommended that you do not to use the Loopback utility in a production environment.  
  
 This loopback scenario does not support signing messages, and thus does not support non-repudiation.  
  
 This scenario supports encryption of messages if you have a certification authority configured, and you have a private key for encryption available for test purposes.  
  
 In this tutorial, you create a home organization, a partner organization, a trade agreement, use the Loopback utility to create a mirror agreement, and then run a sample process to verify the loop-back scenario.
