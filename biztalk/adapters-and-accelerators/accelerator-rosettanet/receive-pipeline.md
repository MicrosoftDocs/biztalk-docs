# Receive Pipeline
This sample provides a working [!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)]Â® [!INCLUDE[BTARN_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/btarn-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] receive pipeline that you can customize for your application.  
  
## Demonstrates  
 This sample demonstrates how to process an incoming RNIF message into the equivalent XML message using the BTARN receive pipeline (PipelineReceive.btp). PipelineReceive.btp is located in *\<drive\>*:\Program Files\Microsoft BizTalk \<version\> Accelerator for RosettaNet\SDK\RNPipelines. It includes the following stages:  
  
-   ReceiveMessageNonRepudiate  
  
-   RNMimeDecoder (MIME Preprocessor/Decoder)  
  
-   RNDAsm (XML Disassembler)  
  
-   RNPartyRes (Party Resolution component)  
  
-   MessageUpdater  
  
 For more information about the components of this pipeline, and the message flow in this pipeline, see [BTARN Receive Pipeline](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-rosettanet/btarn-receive-pipeline.md).
