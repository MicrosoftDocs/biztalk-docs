# Web Application Samples
The Microsoft® [!INCLUDE[BTARN_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/btarn-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] Software Development Kit (SDK) includes an RNIFSend.aspx sample and an RNIFReceive.aspx sample. These ASPX pages send RNIF messages from the initiator to the responder, or receive RNIF messages at the responder.  
  
 For more information about the functionality of the ASPX pages, see [Send and Receive ASPX Pages](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-rosettanet/send-and-receive-aspx-pages.md). This section provides instructions for building and running the samples.
