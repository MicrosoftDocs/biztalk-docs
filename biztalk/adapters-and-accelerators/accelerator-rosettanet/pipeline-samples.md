# Pipeline Samples
The [!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)]® [!INCLUDE[BTARN_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/btarn-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] Software Development Kit (SDK) includes a send pipeline sample and a receive pipeline sample. This section provides information about the functionality that each sample demonstrates, instructions for building and running the samples, and the results that you can expect.  
  
 To build a custom pipeline, you add references to the pipeline project for the RNPIPs, RNIFv11, and RNIFv201 schema assemblies that are in the [!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)].Solutions.BTARN.Schemas namespace. For more information about building custom pipelines, see "Pipelines ([!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Samples Folder)" in [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)] Help.
