# Pipeline Samples
The MicrosoftÂ® [!INCLUDE[BTARN_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/btarn-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] Software Development Kit (SDK) includes a send pipeline sample and a receive pipeline sample. This section provides information about the functionality that each sample demonstrates, instructions for building and running the samples, and the results that you can expect.  
  
 To build a custom pipeline, you add references to the pipeline project for the RNPIPs, RNIFv11, and RNIFv201 schema assemblies that are in the Microsoft .Solutions.BTARN.Schemas namespace. For more information about building custom pipelines, see "Pipelines ([!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Samples Folder)" in BizTalk Server Help.
