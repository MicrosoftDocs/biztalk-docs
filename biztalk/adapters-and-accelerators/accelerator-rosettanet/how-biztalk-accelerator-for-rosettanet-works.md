# How BizTalk Accelerator for RosettaNet Works
Microsoft® [!INCLUDE[BTARN_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/btarn-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] provides a high-technology manufacturing solution by building on Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)]. It does so by providing support for RosettaNet Implementation Framework (RNIF) and Partner Interface Processes (PIPs), and adding components that customize the message processing to high-technology manufacturing applications.
