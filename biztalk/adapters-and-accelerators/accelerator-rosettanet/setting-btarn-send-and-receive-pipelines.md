# Setting BTARN Send and Receive Pipelines
By default, [!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[BTARN_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/btarn-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] uses the standard [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] send pipeline (Microsoft.Solutions.BTARN.Pipelines.Send) and the standard [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] receive pipeline (Microsoft.Solutions.BTARN.Pipelines.Receive) when you create partner send ports. However, you can change the [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] configuration to use an existing BizTalk pipeline or a custom pipeline that you have created. All trading partner agreements, and all partners and home organizations, use the same send pipeline and the same receive pipeline.  
  
 When you first create a partner, [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] creates two send ports for that partner to use, one asynchronous and one synchronous: \<*partner name*\>.Async send port and \<*partner name*\>.Sync send port. These send ports default to the standard [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] send pipeline, and the sync send port receive pipeline defaults to the standard [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] receive pipeline.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Changing the [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] pipeline in the [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] Management Console might reset properties that you changed directly in BizTalk Explorer.  
  
### To change the send or receive pipeline that BTARN uses  
  
1.  Click **Start**, point to **Programs**, point to **Microsoft** [!INCLUDE[btaBTARNNoVersionui](../../includes/btabtarnnoversionui-md.md)], and then click [!INCLUDE[btaBTARNNoVersionui](../../includes/btabtarnnoversionui-md.md)] **Management Console**.  
  
2.  In the BTARN Management Console, right-click the [!INCLUDE[btaBTARNNoVersionui](../../includes/btabtarnnoversionui-md.md)] node, and then click **Properties**.  
  
3.  In the Global Properties dialog box, select a different pipeline from the drop-down list, and then click **OK**.  
  
4.  In the **Host Instances** node under the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3ui](../../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3ui-md.md)]**Administration** node, stop and then restart the host.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  The changes to the pipelines will only take effect if you restart the BizTalk Server.
