# Step 1: Assigning a Strong Name to the Contoso Assembly
In this step, you create and assign a strong name for your BizTalk assembly. A strong name guarantees the uniqueness of an assembly by assigning a digital signature and a unique key pair. Additionally, a strong name provides an integrity check to guarantee that the content of the assembly has not changed since you last built it.  
  
### To create a strong name assembly key file  
  
1.  Start **Visual Studio 2012 Command Prompt**.  
  
2.  At the command prompt, move to the location of the Contoso solution.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  By default, the location of the Contoso solution is *\<drive\>*:\Documents and Settings\\*\<user name\>*\My Documents\Visual Studio \<version\>\Projects.  
  
3.  At the command prompt, type **sn -k FabConPriceAvail.snk**, and then press **Enter**.  
  
4.  At the command prompt, type **Exit**, and then press **Enter**.  
  
### To assign a strong name to your assembly  
  
1.  In Solution Explorer, right-click the **ContosoPriceAndAvailability** project, and then click **Properties**.  
  
2.  In the Property Pages, click **Signing** in the left pane.  
  
3.  In the right pane, select **Sign the assembly**.  
  
4.  Click **Browse** in the Choose the strong name key file field.  
  
5.  Locate your project folder, select the **FabConPriceAvail.snk** file you created earlier, and then click **Open**.  
  
6.  Click **OK** to save the changes.  
  
7.  In Solution Explorer, right-click the **ContosoPriceAndAvailability** project, and then click **Build**. After the build has succeeded, right-click the project again, and then click **Deploy**.
