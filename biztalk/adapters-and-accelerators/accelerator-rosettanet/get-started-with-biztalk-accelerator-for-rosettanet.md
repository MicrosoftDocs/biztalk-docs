# Get started with BizTalk Accelerator for RosettaNet
The Microsoft BizTalk Accelerator for RosettaNet (BTARN) streamlines the development and deployment of RosettaNet standards-based integration solutions. [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] supports the RosettaNet Implementation Framework (RNIF) versions 1.1 and 2.0.01. RNIF is an open network application framework that enables business partners to collaboratively run RosettaNet Partner Interface Processes (PIPs). See GS1 US for more information about RosettaNet standard.

 [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] also supports the exchange of Chemical Data Exchange (CIDX) Chem eStandards.

This section provides role-specific information about how you can use BizTalk Server and the RosettaNet accelerator in your company for enterprise application integration (EAI), and among business partners to automate business-to-business procurement solutions.

## Loopback tutorial

Includes detailed steps that describe how to use the RosettaNet accelerator to simulate a process implementation between the home and partner organization on a single computer.

In this tutorial, you create a home organization, a partner organization, a trade agreement, use the Loopback utility to create a mirror agreement, and then run a sample process to verify the loop-back scenario.

Go to [Loopback tutorial](loopback-tutorial.md).

## Double action tutorial

An end-to-end solution using the RosettaNet accelerator. The tutorial details the steps to implement a RosettaNet-compliant solution by creating a trading partner scenario between two fictitious companies: Contoso, the supplier organization, and Fabrikam, the buyer organization.

It includes working with the BTARN Management Console, creating line-of-business (LOB) applications, and creating custom orchestrations.

## Private process tutorial
An end-to-end solution using the RosettaNet accelerator. The tutorial details the steps to implement a RosettaNet-compliant solution by creating a trading scenario between two fictitious companies: Contoso, the supplier organization, and Fabrikam, the buyer organization.

It outlines various aspects of creating a RosettaNet-based solution, including ERP integration, business policy enforcement, private process customization, and promoting secure communication.
