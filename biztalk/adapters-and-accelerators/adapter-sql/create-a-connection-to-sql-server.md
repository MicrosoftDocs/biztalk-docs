# Create a connection to SQL Server
The [!INCLUDE[adaptersql](../../includes/adaptersql-md.md)] is a [!INCLUDE[firstref_btsWinCommFoundation](../../includes/firstref-btswincommfoundation-md.md)] custom binding. As such, it enables communication to a SQL Server database through a WCF endpoint address. In WCF, the endpoint address identifies the network location of a service and is typically expressed as a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). The [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)] expresses this location as a connection URI, which contains properties that the [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)] uses to establish a connection to the SQL Server database. You must specify a connection URI when you:  
  
- Create a channel factory or a channel listener using the WCF channel model or when you create a WCF client or service host using the WCF service model.  
  
- Create a physical port binding in a [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] solution.  
  
- Use the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservreflong](../../includes/addadapterservreflong-md.md)] to generate a WCF client class or WCF service interface for a WCF service model solution.  
  
- Use the [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservlong](../../includes/consumeadapterservlong-md.md)] to retrieve message schemas from the [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)] for a BizTalk Server solution.  
  
- Use the ServiceModel Metadata Utility tool (svcutil.exe) to generate a WCF client class or WCF service interface for a WCF service model solution.  
  
  The topics in this section describe how to establish a connection between the [!INCLUDE[adaptersql](../../includes/adaptersql-md.md)] and the SQL Server database by providing you with:  
  
- Information about the connection properties and the structure of the SQL Server connection URI.  
  
- Links to topics that show how to specify a connection URI by using the [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)].  
  
- Information about connecting to SQL Server using Windows Authentication.
