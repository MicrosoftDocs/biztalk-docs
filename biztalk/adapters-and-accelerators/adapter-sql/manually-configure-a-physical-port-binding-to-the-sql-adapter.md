# Manually configure a physical port binding to the SQL adapter
This section provides information about configuring the [!INCLUDE[adaptersql](../../includes/adaptersql-md.md)] as a WCF custom binding or as a WCF-SQL port by using the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console. After deploying the adapter, you will be able to send and receive messages from SQL Server by using the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console. The steps for deploying the adapter vary depending on:  
  
- The direction of communication between [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] and the [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)]. You may choose to configure a send, receive, or a send-receive port. Your choices are summarized in the following table.  
  
  |Port direction|Communication pattern|Direction of communication to choose from|  
  |--------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|  
  |Send|One-way|I will always be sending messages on this port.|  
  |Receive|One-way|I will always be receiving messages on this port.|  
  |Send-receive|Request-response|I will be sending a request and receiving a response.|  
  
  > [!NOTE]
  >  Two-way receive ports are not supported by the [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)].  
  
   For more information, see [How to Create a Send Port](../../core/how-to-create-a-send-port2.md), or [How to Create a Receive Port](../../core/how-to-create-a-receive-port.md). 
  
- Whether the adapter sends messages to the SQL Server (outbound operations) or receives messages from SQL Server (inbound operations). Depending on whether you want to send or receive messages, you will create a send or receive port, respectively.  
  
  > [!NOTE]
  >  You can also configure the send or receive ports by importing a binding configuration file that is created by the [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservshort](../../includes/consumeadapterservshort-md.md)] as part of metadata generation. For instructions on configuring ports using this binding file, see [Configure a physical port binding using a port binding file to use the SQL adapter](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sql/configure-a-physical-port-binding-using-a-port-binding-file-to-sql-adapter.md).
