# What operations are supported by the SQL adapter
You can use the adapter clients to perform operations on the SQL Server database by:  
  
- Creating BizTalk projects  
  
- Using the WCF service model  
  
- Using the WCF channel model  
  
  The [!INCLUDE[adaptersql](../../includes/adaptersql-md.md)] exposes operations that applications can invoke on it and that it can, in turn, invoke on applications. These operations are invoked by sending SOAP messages over a channel. If a response is required, it is returned in a SOAP message over the same channel. For information about the message structure and the SOAP action associated with each operation, see [Messages and Message Schemas for BizTalk Adapter for SQL Server](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sql/messages-and-message-schemas-for-biztalk-adapter-for-sql-server.md).  
  
  This section provides information about the operations supported on the SQL Server database using the [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)].
