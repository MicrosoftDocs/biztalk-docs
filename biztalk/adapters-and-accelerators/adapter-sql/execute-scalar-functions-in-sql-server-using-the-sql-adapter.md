# Execute Scalar Functions in SQL Server using the SQL adapter
The Transact-SQL and CLR scalar functions in SQL Server are surfaced as operations in [!INCLUDE[adaptersql](../../includes/adaptersql-md.md)]. The operation name in the [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)] is the same as the name of the scalar function in SQL Server.  
  
 All the parameters in the scalar function are exposed in the corresponding operation. The return value of the operation in the [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)] is the same as the return value defined in the scalar function in SQL Server.  
  
 For more information about executing scalar functions, see [Invoke Scalar Functions in SQL Server using BizTalk Server](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sql/invoke-scalar-functions-in-sql-server-using-biztalk-server.md).
