# Get started with the BizTalk adapter for SQL

  
 This section provides an overview of the adapter, prerequisites, and topics for users who are new to Microsoft [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)]. It discusses the features of [!INCLUDE[adaptersql](../../includes/adaptersql-md.md)] and the different operations that can be performed on the SQL Server database by using the adapter.  
  
 What is an adapter? An adapter is a software component that enables you to send and receive messages to and from a line-of-business (LOB) system. The primary design goal of an adapter is to facilitate the exchange of business documents between trading partners. Because each business system may adhere to specific document formats and protocols, the adapter must use a delivery mechanism that conforms to commonly recognized standards and protocols to provide a uniform interface to the users.  
  
 The adapters in the [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)] can be divided into two broad categories:  
  
- **LOB adapters**. Such adapters provide service-oriented programming model to access LOB systems—for example, adapters for SAP or Siebel.  
  
- **Data adapters**. Such adapters provide service-oriented programming model to access databases—for example, adapters for the Oracle database or SQL Server.  
  
  There are five adapters in the [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)]:  
  
- [!INCLUDE[adaptersql](../../includes/adaptersql-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)]).  
  
  > [!NOTE]
  >  The [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)] is also available outside the [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)] as a separate adapter.  
  
- [!INCLUDE[adapteroracleebusinesslong](../../includes/adapteroracleebusinesslong-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[adapteroraclebusinessshort](../../includes/adapteroraclebusinessshort-md.md)]).  
  
- [!INCLUDE[adapteroracle](../../includes/adapteroracle-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[adapteroracle_short](../../includes/adapteroracle-short-md.md)]).  
  
- [!INCLUDE[adaptersap](../../includes/adaptersap-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)]).  
  
- [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel](../../includes/adaptersiebel-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)]).  
  
  > [!NOTE]
  >  The [!INCLUDE[adaptersiebel_short](../../includes/adaptersiebel-short-md.md)] is not available for 64-bit platforms.  
  
  If you do not already know how you want to use the SQL adapter at your company, it is recommended that you start by exploring the features and functionality of the adapter described in [Understand BizTalk Adapter for SQL Server](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sql/understand-biztalk-adapter-for-sql-server.md).
