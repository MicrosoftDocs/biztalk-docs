# Install the SQL adapter
## Install options
You can install the [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)] in two ways:

* Option 1: With the [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)] installation : See [Install the BizTalk Adapter Pack 2016](../../adapters-and-accelerators/install-the-biztalk-adapter-pack-2016.md), or [Install BizTalk Adapter Pack 2013 R2 and 2013](../../adapters-and-accelerators/install-biztalk-adapter-pack-2013-r2-and-2013.md). You can also install the other WCF-based adapters with this option.
  
* Option 2: By itself, if you only want to install the [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)] as a separate adapter. For this option, use the install guides in this section.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)] included with the  [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)], and the stand-alone [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)] cannot coexist on the same computer.  If you only want the [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)], then install the stand-alone adapter. If you think you may want the [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)], and any of the other WCF-based adapters, then use the [!INCLUDE[adapterpacknoversion](../../includes/adapterpacknoversion-md.md)] setup.
