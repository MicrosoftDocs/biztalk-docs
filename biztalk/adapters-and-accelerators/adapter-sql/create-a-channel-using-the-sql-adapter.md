# Create a channel using the SQL adapter
In the WCF channel model, you invoke operations on the SQL Server database and receive the results by exchanging SOAP messages with the [!INCLUDE[adaptersql](../../includes/adaptersql-md.md)] over a WCF channel.  
  
-   You invoke outbound operations by using either an **IRequestChannel** or an **IOutputChannel** to send messages to the adapter.  
  
-   You receive messages for inbound operations by receiving messages over an **IInputChannel** for **Polling**, **TypedPolling**, or **Notification** operations.  
  
 The procedures in this topic provide information about how to create and configure channel shapes that are used for inbound and outbound operations.  
  
## Creating Outbound (Client) Channels  
 You can use either an **IRequestChannel** or an **IOutputChannel** to invoke operations on the SQL Server database. In either case, you first create a **System.ServiceModel.ChannelFactory** using the appropriate interface. You then use the factory to create the channel. After you have created the channel you can use it to invoke operations on the adapter.  
  
#### To create and open an outbound channel  
  
1.  Create and initialize an instance of **ChannelFactory** for the desired channel shape by using an endpoint and a binding. The endpoint specifies a SQL Server connection URI and the binding is an instance of **sqlBinding**.  
  
2.  Provide SQL Server credentials for the channel factory by using the **Credentials** property.  
  
3.  Open the channel factory.  
  
4.  Get an instance of the channel by invoking the **CreateChannel** method on the channel factory.  
  
5.  Open the channel.  
  
 You can specify the binding and endpoint address in your code or from configuration.  
  
### Specifying the Binding and Endpoint Address in Code  
 The following code example shows how to create an **IRequestChannel** by specifying the binding and endpoint address in code. The code to create an **IOutputChannel** is the same except that you must specify an **IOutputChannel** interface for the **ChannelFactory** and channel type.  
  
```  
// Create binding -- set binding properties before you open the factory.  
SqlAdapterBinding sdbBinding = new SqlAdapterBinding();  
  
// Create address.  
EndpointAddress sdbAddress = new EndpointAddress("mssql://<sql_server_name>//<database_name>?");  
  
// Create channel factory from binding and address.  
ChannelFactory<IRequestChannel> factory =   
    new ChannelFactory<IRequestChannel>(sdbBinding, sdbAddress);  
  
// Specify credentials.   
factory.Credentials.UserName.UserName = "myuser";  
factory.Credentials.UserName.Password = "mypassword";  
  
// Open factory  
factory.Open();  
  
// Get channel and open it.  
IRequestChannel channel = factory.CreateChannel();  
channel.Open();  
```  
  
### Specifying the Binding and Endpoint Address in Configuration  
 The following code example shows how to create a channel factory from a client endpoint specified in configuration.  
  
```  
// Create channel factory from configuration.  
ChannelFactory<IRequestChannel> factory =  
new ChannelFactory<IRequestChannel>("MyRequestChannel");  
  
// Specify credentials.  
factory.Credentials.UserName.UserName = "myuser";  
factory.Credentials.UserName.Password = "mypassword";  
  
// Open the factory.  
factory.Open();  
  
// Get a channel and open it.  
IRequestChannel channel = factory.CreateChannel();  
channel.Open();  
```  
  
#### The Configuration Settings  
 The following code shows the configuration settings used for the preceding example. The contract for the client endpoint must be "System.ServiceModel.Channels.IRequestChannel" or "System.ServiceModel.Channels.IOutputChannel" depending on the kind of channel shape that you want to create.  
  
```  
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>  
<configuration xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/.NetConfiguration/v2.0">  
    <system.serviceModel>  
        <bindings>  
            <sqlBinding>  
                <binding name="SqlAdapterBinding" closeTimeout="00:01:00" openTimeout="00:01:00"  
                    receiveTimeout="00:10:00" sendTimeout="00:01:00" maxConnectionPoolSize="100"  
                    encrypt="false" useAmbientTransaction="true" batchSize="20"  
                    polledDataAvailableStatement="" pollingStatement="" pollingIntervalInSeconds="30"  
                    pollWhileDataFound="false" notificationStatement="" notifyOnListenerStart="true"  
                    enableBizTalkCompatibilityMode="true" chunkSize="4194304"  
                    inboundOperationType="Polling" useDatabaseNameInXsdNamespace="false"  
                    allowIdentityInsert="false" enablePerformanceCounters="false"  
                    xmlStoredProcedureRootNodeName="" xmlStoredProcedureRootNodeNamespace="" />  
            </sqlBinding>  
        </bindings>  
        <client>  
            <endpoint address="mssql://mysqlserver//mydatabase?" binding="sqlBinding"  
                bindingConfiguration="SqlAdapterBinding" contract="System.ServiceModel.Channels.IRequestChannel"  
                name="MyRequestChannel" />  
        </client>  
    </system.serviceModel>  
</configuration>  
```  
  
## Creating Inbound (Service) Channels  
 You configure the [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)] to poll the SQL Server database tables and views by setting binding properties on an instance of **sqlBinding**. You then use this binding to build a channel listener from which you can get an **IInputChannel** channel to receive the **Polling**, **TypedPolling**, or **Notification** operation from the adapter.  
  
#### To create and open an IInputChannel to receive inbound operations  
  
1.  Create an instance of **SQLBinding**.  
  
2.  Set the binding properties required for inbound operation. For example, for a **Polling** operation, at a minimum you must set the **InboundOperationType**, **PolledDataAvailableStatement**, and **PollingStatement** binding properties to configure the [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)] to poll the SQL Server database.  
  
3.  Create a channel listener by invoking **BuildChannelListener\<IInputChannel\>** method on the **SQLBinding**. You specify the SQL Server connection URI as one of the parameters to this method.  
  
4.  Open the listener.  
  
5.  Get an **IInputChannel** channel by invoking the **AcceptChannel** method on listener.  
  
6.  Open the channel.  
  
 The following code shows how to create a channel listener and get an **IInputChannel** to receive data-changed messages from the adapter.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)] only supports one-way receive. So, you must use **IInputChannel** to receive messages for inbound operations from SQL Server.  
  
```  
// Create a binding: specify the InboundOperationType, the PolledDataAvailableStatement, and   
// the PollingStatement binding properties.  
SqlAdapterBinding binding = new SqlAdapterBinding();  
binding.InboundOperationType = InboundOperation.Polling;  
binding.PolledDataAvailableStatement = "SELECT COUNT (*) FROM EMPLOYEE";  
binding.PollingStatement = "SELECT * FROM Employee;EXEC MOVE_EMP_DATA;EXEC ADD_EMP_DETAILS John, Tester, 100000";  
  
// Create a binding parameter collection and set the credentials  
ClientCredentials credentials = new ClientCredentials();  
credentials.UserName.UserName = "myuser";  
credentials.UserName.Password = "mypassword";  
  
BindingParameterCollection bindingParams = new BindingParameterCollection();  
bindingParams.Add(credentials);  
  
// Get a listener from the binding and open it.  
Uri connectionUri = new Uri("mssql://mysqlserver//mydatabase?");  
IChannelListener<IInputChannel> listener = binding.BuildChannelListener<IInputChannel>(connectionUri, bindingParams);  
listener.Open();  
  
// Get a channel from the listener and open it.  
IInputChannel channel = listener.AcceptChannel();  
channel.Open();  
```
