# Run composite operations in SQL Server  using the SQL adapter
The [!INCLUDE[adaptersql](../../includes/adaptersql-md.md)] enables adapter clients to perform composite operations on the SQL Server database. A composite operation can include any number of the following operations, and in any order:  
  
- The Insert, Update, and Delete operations on the tables and views.  
  
- Stored procedures that are surfaced as operations in the adapter.  
  
  The operations in a composite operation *must* target tables and views only in a single database.  
  
  For information about:  
  
- How to perform composite operations in [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)] using the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], see [Run Composite Operations on SQL Server Using BizTalk Server](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sql/run-composite-operations-on-sql-server-using-biztalk-server.md).  
  
- Message schemas for the composite operation, see [Message Schemas for Composite Operations](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sql/message-schemas-for-composite-operations.md).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  If there are “n” number of operations in a composite operation that return a result set then “n+1” number of connections are required for the composite operation to be executed. Therefore, you must ensure that the value specified for the **MaxConnectionPoolSize** binding property is n+1 or greater. For more information about the **MaxConnectionPoolSize** binding property, see [Read about BizTalk Adapter for SQL Server adapter Binding Properties](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sql/read-about-the-biztalk-adapter-for-sql-server-adapter-binding-properties.md).
