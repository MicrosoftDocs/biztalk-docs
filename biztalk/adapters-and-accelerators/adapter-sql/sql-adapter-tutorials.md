# SQL Adapter Tutorials
The first of the [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)] tutorials contains detailed instructions on how to migrate BizTalk projects created using the previous version of the SQL adapter to use the WCF-based [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)]. The other [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)] contains, scenario-based, step-by-step instructions on performing operations on SQL Server using the [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)].  
  
 Also, the topics in the [Develop BizTalk applications](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sql/develop-biztalk-applications-using-the-sql-adapter.md) section provide detailed instructions on how to use the [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)].
