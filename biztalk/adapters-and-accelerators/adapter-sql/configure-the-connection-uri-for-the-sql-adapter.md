# Configure the connection URI for the SQL adapter
A connection URI is a connection string that contains parameters required to connect to SQL Server. While using the [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservshort](../../includes/consumeadapterservshort-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[addadapterwiz](../../includes/addadapterwiz-md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)], you must specify the URI to connect to SQL Server to generate the metadata. While configuring a send or receive port using the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console, you must specify the URI to connect to SQL Server to perform operations.  

## Enter the connection URI from Visual Studio  
 From [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)], you can specify the connection URI using the [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservshort](../../includes/consumeadapterservshort-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[addadapterwiz](../../includes/addadapterwiz-md.md)].  

### Use the Consume Adapter Service Add-in

For more information about binding properties, see [Read about the BizTalk Adapter for SQL Server adapter Binding Properties](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sql/read-about-the-biztalk-adapter-for-sql-server-adapter-binding-properties.md).  

    > [!NOTE]
    >  If you selected an existing WCF-SQL send port, you need not specify the binding properties. The binding properties are picked from the send port configuration. However, you may choose to specify the binding properties that are required at design-time, if any. In such case, the new values for binding properties will be used at design-time while generating the metadata. However, at run-time the values specified for binding properties in the send port configuration will be applicable.  

10. Click **OK**.  

## Enter the connection URI from the BizTalk Server Administration Console  
 From the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console, you can specify the connection URI as part of the WCF-Custom or a WCF-SQL port configuration.  

### Enter the connection URI for the WCF-Custom port  

1. Start the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console.  

2. In the console tree, expand **BizTalk Group**, then expand **Applications**, and then expand the application under which you want to create a port, and click **Send Ports** or **Receive Ports**. In the right pane, you can choose to create a port or select an existing port.  

3. In the port properties dialog box, from the **Type** drop-down list, select **WCF-Custom**, and then click **Configure**.  

   > [!NOTE]

6. In the **WCF-Custom Transport Properties** dialog box, click the **Binding** tab. From the **Binding Type** drop-down list, select **sqlBinding**.  

7. If you are creating a send port, in the **WCF-Custom Transport Properties** dialog box, click the **Credentials** tab, and do one of the following:  

   -   Select the **Do not use Single Sign-On** option, and specify the user name and password to connect to SQL Server. Note that the user name and password are case-sensitive.  

       > [!NOTE]
       >  If you want to connect to SQL Server using Windows authentication, specify a blank user name and password. Before you do this, the Windows user with which you are logged in must be added to SQL Server as described in [Connect to SQL Server Using Windows Authentication with the SQL adapter](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sql/connect-to-sql-server-using-windows-authentication-with-the-sql-adapter.md).  

   -   Select the **Use Single Sign-On** option, and specify an affiliate Enterprise Single Sign-on (SSO) application.  

8. If you are creating a receive port, in the **WCF-Custom Transport Properties** dialog box, click the **Other** tab, and do one of the following:  

   -   Select **User account** option, and specify the user name and password to connect to SQL Server. Note that the user name and password are case-sensitive.  

       > [!NOTE]
       >  If you want to connect to SQL Server using Windows authentication, specify a blank user name and password. Before you do this, the Windows user with which you are logged in must be added to SQL Server as described in [Connect to SQL Server Using Windows Authentication with the SQL adapter](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sql/connect-to-sql-server-using-windows-authentication-with-the-sql-adapter.md).  

   -   Select **Get credentials from affiliate application** option, and specify an affiliate SSO application.  

9. Click **OK**.  

### Enter the connection URI for the WCF-SQL port  

1. Start the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console.  

2. Add the WCF-SQL adapter to the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console.
