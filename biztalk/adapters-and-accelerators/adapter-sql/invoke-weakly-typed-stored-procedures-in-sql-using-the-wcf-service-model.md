# Invoke Weakly-typed Stored Procedures in SQL using the WCF Service Model
When you invoke a procedure listed under the **Procedures** node in the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)], the output is in the form of a DataSet array. This topic provides instructions on how to create a WCF client to invoke a stored procedure in SQL Server that returns a DataSet array.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If you are performing operation on tables that have columns of user-defined types, make sure you refer to [Operations on Tables and Views with User-Defined Types using the SQL adapter](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sql/operations-on-tables-and-views-with-user-defined-types-using-the-sql-adapter.md) before you start developing your application.  
  
## About the Examples Used in this Topic  
 The example in this topic uses the GET_EMP_DETAILS stored procedure. This stored procedure takes an employee ID as an input parameter and returns all the corresponding columns for the employee with that ID. The GET_EMP_DETAILS stored procedure is created by running the SQL script provided with the samples. For more information about samples, see [Adapter Samples](../../adapters-and-accelerators/accelerator-rosettanet/adapter-samples.md). A sample, **Execute_StoredProc**, which is based on this topic, is also provided with the [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)] samples.  
  
## The WCF Client Class  
 The name of the WCF client generated for invoking stored procedures under the **Procedures** node using the [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)] is listed in the following table.  
  
|SQL Server Database Artifact|WCF Client Name|  
|----------------------------------|---------------------|  
|Procedure (under the **Procedures** node)|Procedures_[schema]Client|  
  
 [schema] is the schema to which the procedure belongs; for example “dbo”.  
  
### Method Signature for Invoking Stored Procedures  
 The following table shows the signature for the method exposed to invoke the stored procedures.  
  
|Operation|Method Signature|  
|---------------|----------------------|  
|Procedure name|System.Data.DataSet[] [procedure_name](param1, param2, …\)|  
  
 [procedure_name] is the name of the procedure; for example GET_EMP_DETAILS  
  
 As an example, the signature for the method to invoke the GET_EMP_DETAILS procedure is shown in the following code snippet.  
  
```  
public partial class Procedures_dboClient : System.ServiceModel.ClientBase<Procedures_dbo>, Procedures_dbo {  
  public System.Data.DataSet[] GET_EMP_DETAILS(System.Nullable<int> emp_id, out int ReturnValue);  
}  
```  
  
 In this snippet,  
  
-   `Procedures_dboClient` is the name of the WCF client class. In this example, you use this class to create a client to invoke the stored procedure.  
  
-   `public System.Data.DataSet[] GET_EMP_DETAILS(System.Nullable<int> emp_id, out int ReturnValue)` is the method that you invoke in this example to invoke the stored procedure. This stored procedure takes an employee ID and returns a DataSet array.  
  
## Create a WCF Client to Invoke a Stored Procedure in SQL Server  
 The generic set of actions required to perform an operation on SQL Server using a WCF client involves a set of tasks described in [Overview of the WCF Service Model with the Adapter](overview-of-the-wcf-service-model-with-the-sql-adapter.md). This section specifically describes how to create a WCF client that invokes a stored procedure, the result set for which is a DataSet array. In this topic, as an example, you invoke the GET_EMP_DETAILS stored procedure. This stored procedure is created by running the SQL script provided with each sample.  
  
  
1. Create a Visual C# project in Visual Studio. For this topic, create a console application.  
  
2. Generate the WCF client class for the GET_EMP_DETAILS stored procedure. Make sure you select the procedure under the **Procedures** node. For more information about generating a WCF client class, see [Generate a WCF Client or WCF Service Contract for SQL Server Artifacts](generate-a-wcf-client-or-wcf-service-contract-for-sql-server-artifacts.md).  
  
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   >  Before generating the WCF client class, make sure you set the **EnableBizTalkCompatibilityMode** binding property to false.  
  
3. In the Solution Explorer, add reference to `Microsoft.Adapters.Sql` and `Microsoft.ServiceModel.Channels`.  
  
4. Open the Program.cs file and create a client as described in the snippet below.  
  
   ```  
  
             Procedures_dboClient client = new Procedures_dboClient("SqlAdapterBinding_Procedures_dbo");  
  
   client.ClientCredentials.UserName.UserName = "<Enter username here>";  
   client.ClientCredentials.UserName.Password = "<Enter password here>";  
   ```  
  
    In this snippet, `Procedures_dboClient` is the WCF client defined in SqlAdapterBindingClient.cs. This file is generated by the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)]. `SqlAdapterBinding_Procedures_dbo` is the name of the client endpoint configuration and is defined in the app.config. This file is also generated by the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)] and contains the binding properties and other configuration settings.  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   >  In this snippet, you use the binding and endpoint address from the configuration file. You can also explicitly specify these values in your code. For more information on the different ways of specifying client binding, see [Configure a Client Binding for the SQL Adapter](configure-a-client-binding-for-the-sql-adapter.md).  
  
5. Open the client as described in the snippet below:  
  
   ```  
   try  
   {  
      Console.WriteLine("Opening Client...");  
      client.Open();  
   }  
   catch (Exception ex)  
   {  
      Console.WriteLine("Exception: " + ex.Message);  
      throw;  
   }  
   ```  
  
6. Invoke the GET_EMP_DETAILS stored procedure. Before you invoke the GET_EMP_DETAILS procedure, you must add the `System.Data` namespace to your code.  
  
   ```  
   DataSet[] dataArray;  
   int returnCode;  
  
   try  
   {  
      Console.WriteLine("Calling a stored procedure...");  
      dataArray = client.GET_EMP_DETAILS(10001, out returnCode);  //Invoke the stored procedure  
   }  
   catch (Exception ex)  
   {  
      Console.WriteLine("Exception: " + ex.Message);  
      throw;  
   }  
   Console.WriteLine("The details for the employee with ID '10001' are:");  
   Console.WriteLine("*************************************************");  
  
   foreach (DataSet dataSet in dataArray)  
   {  
      foreach (DataTable tab in dataArray[0].Tables)  
      {  
         foreach (DataRow row in tab.Rows)  
         {  
            for (int i = 0; i < tab.Columns.Count; i++)  
            {  
               Console.WriteLine(row[i]);  
            }  
         }  
      }  
   }  
   Console.WriteLine("*************************************************");  
  
   ```  
  
7. Close the client as described in the snippet below:  
  
   ```  
   client.Close();  
   Console.WriteLine("Press any key to exit...");  
   Console.ReadLine();  
   ```  
  
8. Build the project and then run it. The details for the employee, for which you pr
9. ovided the ID, are displayed on the console.
