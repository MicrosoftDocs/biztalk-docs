# Configure the sign in credentials for the SQL adapter
The [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)] requires the adapter clients to provide client credentials. The adapter uses these credentials to authenticate the user with SQL Server and to establish a connection.  

 Adapter clients can provide the client credentials both when using [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] and when using the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console. When using [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)], credentials are required to generate the metadata. When using the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console, credentials are required to perform operations on SQL Server.  

 This section provides information about specifying client credentials in [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] and the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console.  

## Enter credentials from Visual Studio  
 From [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)], you can specify the credentials using the [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservshort](../../includes/consumeadapterservshort-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[addadapterwiz](../../includes/addadapterwiz-md.md)].  

### Using Consume Adapter Service Add-in  

1.  Right-click your BizTalk project, point to **Add**, and then select **Add Generated Items**.  

2.  In the **Add Generated Items** dialog box, do the following:  

    |Use this|To do this|  
    |--------------|----------------|  
    |**Categories**|Click **Consume Adapter Service**.|  
    |**Templates**|Click **Consume Adapter Service**.|  

3.  To start the **Consume Adapter Service** dialog box, click **Add**.  

4.  In the **Consume Adapter Service** dialog box, from the **Select a binding** list, select **sqlBinding**, and then click **Configure**.  

5.  In the **Configure Adapter** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and from the **Client credential type** list, do one of the following:  

    > [!NOTE]
    >  If you are connecting to SQL Server using Windows Authentication, the Windows user with which you are logged in must be added to SQL Server as described in [Connect to SQL Server Using Windows Authentication with the SQL adapter](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sql/connect-to-sql-server-using-windows-authentication-with-the-sql-adapter.md).  

    |Click this|To do this|

3. In the port properties dialog box, from the **Type** drop-down list, select **WCF-Custom**, and then click **Configure**.  

   > [!NOTE]
   >  To see the location properties dialog box for a receive port, click the **Receive Location** tab on the left pane of the port properties dialog box, and then click **New**.  

4. If you are creating a send port, in the **WCF-Custom Transport Properties** dialog box, click the **Credentials** tab, and do one of the following:

3. In the console tree, expand **BizTalk Group**, then expand **Applications**, and then expand the application under which you want to create a port, and click **Send Ports** or **Receive Ports**. In the right pane, you can choose to create a port or select an existing port.  

4. In the port properties dialog box, from the **Type** drop-down list, select the WCF-SQL adapter you added earlier, and then click **Configure**.  

   > [!NOTE]
   >  To see the location properties dialog box for a receive port, click the **Receive Location** tab on the left pane of the port properties dialog box, and then click **New**.  

5. If you are creating a send port, in the transport properties dialog box, click the **Credentials** tab, and do one of the following:
