|SQL Server client libraries. See the [supported versions](#BKMK_SuppLOB) (in this topic).|

<a name="BKMK_SuppLOB"></a>   
## Supported SQL Server versions and client libraries  
 The following section presents the supported SQL Server versions and the client libraries required by the [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)].  
  
-   **Supported server versions**: SQL Server 2016, SQL Server 2014
  
-   **Supported client versions**: Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsDotNetFramework_md](../../includes/btsdotnetframework-md.md)] bundles the client DLLs required to connect to SQL Server. You do not need to explicitly install any client DLLs on your computer.  
  
-   **Required drivers**:  
  
    -   If you use the UDTs shipped with the SQL Server versions, for example, Geography, make sure the following DLLs are present on the computer where you use the adapter to perform operations on SQL Server. For example, if you create BizTalk projects to perform operations on SQL Server, these DLLs must be present on the computer where BizTalk Server is running.  
  
        -   Make sure Microsoft.SqlServer.Types.dll is added to the GAC.  
  
        -   Make sure SqlServerSpatial.dll is available in the System32 folder.  
  
         You can install these DLLs on the computer by running the SQL Server setup and selecting **Management Tools – Basic** and **Management Tools – Complete** in the **Feature Selection** page of the wizard.  
  
    -   If you use the adapter to perform operations on columns of FILESTREAM data types, make sure you have SQL Client Connectivity SDK installed. You can install the SQL Client Connectivity SDK by running the SQL Server setup and selecting **SQL Client Connectivity SDK** in the **Feature Selection** page of the wizard. The adapter uses the sqlncli10.dll, installed with the SQL Client Connectivity SDK, to perform FILESTREAM operations.  
  
    -   If you create your own UDTs in SQL Server, make sure the respective assemblies for the UDTs are added to the GAC.  
  
<a name="BKMK_Compat"></a>   
## 64-bit support 

The [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)] can run in a 32-bit or 64-bit host instance.

 For information about the supported installation scenarios for the 32-bit and 64-bit [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)], see  [32-bit and 64-bit install scenarios](#BKMK_Install_Scenarios) (in this topic).
  
<a name="BKMK_Install_Adap"></a>   
## Install the SQL adapter  
 Make sure you have the prerequisites installed before installing the [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)]. See [.NET prerequisites](#BKMK_prereq_NET) (in this topic), or [BizTalk Server prerequisites](#BKMK_prereq_BTS) (in this topic).
  
 You can install the [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)] in the following two ways:  
  
-   **In interactive mode** using the setup wizard
  
-   **In silent mode** using msiexec in the command line  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >  You must have administrative privileges on the computer where you install the [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)], irrespective of whether you are installing by using the wizard or the command line.    

### <a name="BKMK_Install_Scenarios"></a> 32-bit and 64-bit install scenarios
 With [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], the [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)] can be used for:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] design time (when generating metadata for operations).  
  
-   BizTalk Server Administration console design time (for creating physical ports).  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  BizTalk Server Administration console runs as a 32-bit Microsoft Management Console (MMC) application.  
  
-   BizTalk run time (when sending and receiving messages from LOB applications).  
  
 You can have an installation where you perform all these tasks on the same computer or different computers. Because both [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] and BizTalk MMC are 32-bit processes, you must install the 32-bit [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)] on the computer where you want to perform the design-time tasks. The following scenarios are supported for installing the [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)] on 32-bit and 64-bit platforms.  
  
#### 32-bit install scenarios
