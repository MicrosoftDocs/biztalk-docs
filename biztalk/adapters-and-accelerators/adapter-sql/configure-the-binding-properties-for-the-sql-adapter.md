# Configure the binding properties for the SQL adapter
The [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)] surfaces several binding properties that enable you to control some of its behavioral characteristics. This section provides information about setting the binding properties from [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] and from the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console. From [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)], you must specify the binding properties to generate schema for specific operations. From [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], you must specify the binding properties as part of the send or receive port for sending or receiving messages from SQL Server.  

 For information about the binding properties, including a list of binding properties for the [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)], see [Read about the BizTalk Adapter for SQL Server adapter binding properties](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sql/read-about-the-biztalk-adapter-for-sql-server-adapter-binding-properties.md).  

## Enter the binding properties in Visual Studio  
 From [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)], you can specify the binding properties using the [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservshort](../../includes/consumeadapterservshort-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[addadapterwiz](../../includes/addadapterwiz-md.md)].  

### Using Consume Adapter Service Add-in  

1.  Right-click your BizTalk project, and then select **Add Generated Items**.  

2.  In the **Add Generated Items** dialog box, do the following:  

    |Use this|To do this|  
    |--------------|----------------|  
    |**Categories**|Click **Consume Adapter Service**.|  
    |**Templates**|Click **Consume Adapter Service**.|  

3.  To start the **Consume Adapter Service** dialog box, click **Add**.  

4.  In the **Consume Adapter Service** dialog box, from the **Select a binding** drop-down list, select **sqlBinding**, and then click **Configure**.  

5.  In the **Configure Adapter** dialog box, click the **Binding Properties** tab, and then specify the different binding properties.  

6.  Click **OK**.  

### Using Add Adapter Metadata Wizard  

1. Right-click the BizTalk project, point to **Add**, and then click **Add Generated Items**.  

2. In the **Add Generated Items** dialog box, do the following:  


   |    Use this    |           To do this            |
   |----------------|---------------------------------|
   | **Categories** |     Click **Add Adapter**.      |
   | **Templates**  | Click **Add Adapter Metadata**. |


3. Click **Add**. The [!INCLUDE[addadapterwiz](../../includes/addadapterwiz-md.md)] opens.  

4. In the Add Adapter Wizard, select **WCF-SQL**. Select the computer on which BizTalk Server is installed and the name of the BizTalk database.  

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   >  If you already have a WCF-SQL port configured in BizTalk, select the port from the **Port** list.  

5. Click **Next**.  

6. In the **Consume Adapter Service** dialog box, from the **Select a binding** drop-down list, select **sqlBinding**, and then click **Configure**.  

7. Click the **Binding Properties** tab, and then specify values for the binding properties, if any, required by the operations you want to target. For more information about binding properties, see [Read about the BizTalk Adapter for SQL Server adapter binding properties](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sql/read-about-the-biztalk-adapter-for-sql-server-adapter-binding-properties.md).  

   > [!NOTE]
   >  If you selected an existing WCF-SQL send port, you need not specify the binding properties. The binding properties are picked from the send port configuration. However, you may choose to specify the binding properties that are required at design-time, if any. In such case, the new values for binding properties will be used at design-time while generating the metadata. However, at run-time the values specified for binding properties in the send port configuration will be applicable.  

8. Click **OK**.  

## Enter binding properties from the BizTalk Server Administration console  
 From the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console, you can specify the binding properties as part of the WCF-Custom or WCF-SQL port configuration.  

### Enter binding properties for WCF-Custom port  

1. Start the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console.  

2. In the console tree, expand **BizTalk Group**, then expand **Applications**, and then expand the application under which you want to create a port, and click **Send Ports** or **Receive Ports**. In the right pane, you can choose to create a port or select an existing port.  

3. In the port properties dialog box, from the **Type** drop-down list, select **WCF-Custom**, and then click **Configure**.  

   > [!NOTE]
   >  To see the location properties dialog box for a receive port, click the **Receive Location** tab on the left pane of the port properties dialog box, and then click **New**.  

4. In the **WCF-Custom Transport Properties** dialog box, click the **Binding** tab.  

5. From the **Binding Type** list, select **sqlBinding**.  

6. In the **Configuration** box, specify the values for the different binding properties, and then click **OK**.  

### Enter binding properties for the WCF-SQL port  

1. Start the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console.  

2. Add the WCF-SQL adapter to the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console. For instructions, see [Adding the SQL Adapter to BizTalk Server Administration Console](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sql/adding-the-sql-adapter-to-biztalk-server-administration-console.md).  

3. In the console tree, expand **BizTalk Group**, then expand **Applications**, and then expand the application under which you want to create a port, and click **Send Ports** or **Receive Ports**. In the right pane, you can choose to create a port or select an existing port.  

4. In the port properties dialog box, from the **Type** drop-down list, select the WCF-SQL adapter you added earlier, and then click **Configure**.  

   > [!NOTE]
   >  To see the location properties dialog box for a receive port, click the **Receive Location** tab on the left pane of the port properties dialog box, and then click **New**.  

5. In the transport properties dialog box, click the **Binding** tab and specify values for binding properties.  

   > [!NOTE]
   >  The binding properties are displayed based on whether you are configuring a send port or a receive port. For example, binding properties related to notifications are not available while configuring a send port because notifications are inbound operations and require a receive port configuration.  

6. Click **OK**.
