# Get metadata for SQL Server operations in Visual Studio using the SQL adapter
The [!INCLUDE[adaptersql](../../includes/adaptersql-md.md)] provides three [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] components that you can use to help you develop solutions using the adapterâ€”the [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservlong](../../includes/consumeadapterservlong-md.md)], the [!INCLUDE[addadapterwiz](../../includes/addadapterwiz-md.md)], and the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservreflong](../../includes/addadapterservreflong-md.md)]. Adapter clients must use these components to connect to SQL Server and then generate metadata for the operations they want to perform.  
  
 All these [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] components simplify development by:  
  
- Providing a Microsoft Windows interface through which you can browse and search for operations that you want to use in your solution.  
  
- Retrieving metadata exposed by the adapter for these target operations.  
  
- Converting that metadata, which is expressed as a Web Services Description Language (WSDL) document by the adapter, into a form that you can use in your solution (XSD message schemas for BizTalk projects or a .NET object representation of a service contract for the WCF service model) and adding it to your project.  
  
  This section provides instructions about how to use the [!INCLUDE[consumeadapterservshort](../../includes/consumeadapterservshort-md.md)], the [!INCLUDE[addadapterwiz](../../includes/addadapterwiz-md.md)], and the [!INCLUDE[addadapterservrefshort](../../includes/addadapterservrefshort-md.md)].
