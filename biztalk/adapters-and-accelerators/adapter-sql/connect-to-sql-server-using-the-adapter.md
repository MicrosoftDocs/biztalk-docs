# Connect to SQL Server using the adapter
The [!INCLUDE[adaptersql](../../includes/adaptersql-md.md)] requires adapter clients to provide a connection string, called the connection Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), to connect to the SQL Server database. Internally, the [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)] maps the URI to a database connection string to connect to the SQL Server database. With a connection URI, adapter clients can specify connection parameters to connect to an external system. For more information about the connection URI, see [Create the SQL Server Connection URI](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sql/create-the-sql-server-connection-uri.md).  
  
 In the connection URI, you can also specify the name of a failover SQL Server database on a standby computer to connect to if the primary SQL Server database is not available. The failover SQL Server database must be a mirror of the primary SQL Server database. The failover SQL Server database is specified using an optional parameter, FailoverPartner, in the connection URI. Providing a failover SQL Server database ensures high availability and data redundancy. For more information about high availability with respect to SQL Server, see [Database Mirroring in SQL Server](/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/database-mirroring-in-sql-server).
  
 Make sure you comply with the security guidelines when establishing a connection with the SQL Server database. For more information about security guidelines, see [Secure your SQL applications](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sql/secure-your-sql-applications.md).
