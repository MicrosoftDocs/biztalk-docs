# Step 1: Deploy the Orchestration
![Step 1 of 4](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-ebs/media/step-1of4.gif "Step_1of4")  
  
 **Time to complete:** 5 minutes  
  
 **Objective:** In this step, deploy the orchestration solution.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 You must have completed the steps in [Lesson 4: Perform an Insert Operation on the Purchase Order Table](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sql/lesson-4-perform-an-insert-operation-on-the-purchase-order-table.md).  
  
### To deploy the solution  
  
1.  In Solution Explorer, right-click the solution name, and then click **Properties**.  
  
2.  In the properties pages dialog box, in the tree control, expand **Configuration Properties**, and then click **Configuration**.  
  
3.  On the **Configuration** page, in the **Deploy** column, select the check box against the BizTalk project, and then click **OK**.  
  
4.  In Solution Explorer, right-click the solution name, and then click **Deploy Solution**.  
  
     The Output pane at the bottom of the screen should read: **Deploy: 1 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 skipped**.  
  
## What did I just do?  
 In this step, you deployed the BizTalk orchestration to [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console.  
  
## Next Steps  
 You create the physical ports in [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console, as described in [Step 2: Configure the Ports](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sql/step-2-configure-the-ports.md).
