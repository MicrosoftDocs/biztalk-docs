# Step 3: Test the Migrated Application that uses the SQL adapter
![Step 3 of 3](../../adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-oracle-database/media/step-3of3.gif "Step_3of3")  
  
 **Time to complete:** 5 minutes  
  
 **Objective:** In this step, you will test the migrated application by performing an Insert operation on the Customer table. To do this, you drop a request message that conforms to the schema generated using the vPrev [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)].  
  
## Prerequisites  
  
-   Configure the BizTalk application by mapping the logical ports in the BizTalk orchestration to physical ports in the BizTalk Server Administration console.  
  
-   Configure the BizTalk application to use the WCF-Custom send port for the WCF-based [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)].  
  
### To test the migrated application  
  
1.  Create a request XML that conforms to the schema generated by the vPrev [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)]. Using the outbound map, the WCF-Custom send port converts this to conform to the schema for the WCF-based [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)] and sends it to the SQL Server database.  
  
    ```  
    <Insert xmlns="http://SQLInsert">  
      <sync>  
        <after>  
          <CustomerTable Name="John" />  
        </after>  
      </sync>  
    </Insert>  
    ```  
  
2.  Paste the request message to the folder that is mapped to the file receive location.  
  
3.  The orchestration consumes the request message and sends it to the SQL Server database. The response from the SQL Server database is received in the schema that conforms to the schema of the WCF-based [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)]. Using the inbound map, the WCF-Custom send port converts this to the schema for the vPrev [!INCLUDE[adaptersqlshort](../../includes/adaptersqlshort-md.md)]. The response from the SQL Server database is saved to the other file location defined as part of the orchestration. The response for the preceding request message is:  
  
    ```  
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>   
    <InsertResponse xmlns="http://SQLInsert">  
      <Success>  
        <long xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays">101</long>   
      </Success>  
    </InsertResponse>  
    ```  
  
     In the preceding response, “101” is the value of the identity column inserted in the Customer table.
