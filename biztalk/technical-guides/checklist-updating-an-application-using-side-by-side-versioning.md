# Checklist: Updating an Application Using Side-by-Side Versioning
The following checklist describes the process of deploying an updated version of a BizTalk application that will run side-by-side with an existing version.

 A side-by-side installation enables you to roll out an application upgrade incrementally. You can make the installation available to a subset of business partners initially, rather than to all partners at once. Using this approach allows you to continue running the existing application to service the users who are not yet using the new version until you are ready to completely move over to the new version.

 The two side-by-side applications will have to receive messages on two different receive locations. As a result, to run side-by-side applications you must ask those trading partners who should use the new version of the application to send messages to the new receive location, so that they will be processed by the new version. Those trading partners who should use the old version should send messages to the previous receive location.
