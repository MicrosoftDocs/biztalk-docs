# Preparing Applications for Disaster Recovery
BizTalk applications (binaries and configuration artifacts such as receive locations and send ports) are deployed to the production BizTalk group when the group is restored at the disaster recovery site. This configuration may have to be altered depending on whether there are configuration locations such as receive locations and send ports that are production-specific.  
  
 To speed the restoration of applications at the disaster recovery site, a [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] .msi file that installs the binaries on the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] run-time servers must be kept up-to-date on the disaster recovery [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] run-time servers. When the production BizTalk group is restored at the disaster recovery site, a disaster recovery-specific application configuration .msi file may need to be installed in order to configure the application for disaster recovery-specific artifacts, such as receive locations and send ports, as necessary.
