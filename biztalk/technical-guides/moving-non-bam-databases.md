# Moving Non-BAM Databases
You can use this procedure to move the primary BizTalk Server databases to another server.

 This section also contains a topic that describes procedures that must be followed after moving particular [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] databases. Complete the steps in the topic as appropriate for your environment.
