# Providing High Availability
High availability is provided for a [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] environment by implementing redundancy for each functional component in the environment. Redundancy for a BizTalk Host can be accomplished by installing multiple computers running [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] in a BizTalk group and then configuring instances of the host to run on more than one of the computers running [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] in the group. Redundancy for other components in a [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] environment can be accomplished by configuring the components as resources in a [!INCLUDE[btsWinSvrNoVersion](../includes/btswinsvrnoversion-md.md)] cluster. [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] also accommodates configuring BizTalk Hosts as resources in a [!INCLUDE[btsWinSvrNoVersion](../includes/btswinsvrnoversion-md.md)] cluster, which is recommended to provide high availability for certain BizTalk adapters.  
  
 This section describes how to provide high availability for the functional components in a [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] environment.
