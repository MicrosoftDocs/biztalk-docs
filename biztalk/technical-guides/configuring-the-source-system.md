# Configuring the Source System
For the purposes of BizTalk Server log shipping, it does not matter if the source system is located on a single [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] instance or if it is distributed among multiple instances hosted in a Windows Server cluster. There are no additional considerations other than those required to successfully run the Backup BizTalk Server job. To configure this job, see [How to Configure the Backup BizTalk Server Job](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=154072) (<http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=154072>) in BizTalk Server Help. After you have configured the Backup BizTalk Server Job, proceed to the topic [How to Configure the Destination System](../technical-guides/how-to-configure-the-destination-system.md).
