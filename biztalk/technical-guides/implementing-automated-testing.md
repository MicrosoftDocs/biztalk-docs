# Implementing Automated Testing
BizTalk Server solutions are often deployed in “mission-critical” scenarios, whereby the BizTalk solution is a core component of the business. In these scenarios, the continual performance and stability of the BizTalk solution is a key business requirement; if the BizTalk solution fails, the associated downtime costs are significant. In such scenarios, it is of paramount importance that the BizTalk solution be thoroughly tested before the solution is placed into production. The costs associated with properly testing the solution are small compared to the downtime costs resulting from not testing or insufficiently testing the solution. Therefore, the testing of a BizTalk Server solution is arguably the most important phase of any BizTalk Server solution deployment.  
  
 This section describes the proper methodology for testing a BizTalk solution before running the solution in a production environment.
