# Performing Bottleneck Testing and Tuning
You should complete performance testing to determine bottlenecks in the system and to tune the system accordingly.  
  
## Testing a Subsystem  
 A best practice for identifying system bottlenecks is to run performance tests on subsets of the entire system, for example:  
  
- Establish baseline performance parameters for external systems that send messages to or receive message from [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)].  
  
- Enlist orchestrations, but do not start them. Drop messages into the inbound queues/file locations and let the inbound receive adapters drain the queue/file locations and publish messages into the MessageBox database. This allows you to isolate your receive ports to determine their maximum sustained input rate.  
  
- Once the messages are pulled into the MessageBox database, stop the receive adapters, enable the orchestration processes and/or send adapters, and then measure the rate at which orchestrations and/or send adapters are processing messages.  
  
## Testing the End-to-End System  
 Testing of input and output rates as described in preceding section is an effective way to isolate performance of the application subsystem, although it does not describe end-to-end performance. You should also test end-to-end performance because some bottlenecks cannot be identified until multiple resources begin to contend for the same shared resource (for example, the MessageBox database).  
  
 To generate load against a [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] environment, consider using the Microsoft BizTalk LoadGen 2007 tool. Download [LoadGen](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=14925).  
  
 To generate and analyze a performance report for a [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] environment, consider using the Performance Analysis of Logs (PAL) tool. For more information about the PAL tool, see [Using the Performance Analysis of Logs (PAL) Tool](../technical-guides/using-the-performance-analysis-of-logs-pal-tool.md).  
  
## What Developers, Operators, and Administrators Should Know  
 [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] developers should be well versed on [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] performance characteristics and tuning. Operators and administrators should be knowledgeable about MessageBox database scale-out aspects, SAN tuning, network tuning, and SQL Server database tuning (for example, see [SQL Server Settings That Should Not Be Changed](../technical-guides/sql-server-settings-that-should-not-be-changed.md)). Developers, operators, and administrators should be aware of how to tune [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] for high-throughput and low-latency.
