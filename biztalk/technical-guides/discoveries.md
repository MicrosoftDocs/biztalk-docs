# Discoveries
The [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Management Pack provides a centralized management and monitoring experience for BizTalk Server related artifacts.  
  
## Discovery of artifacts  
 With [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Management Pack, the monitoring agents discover the artifacts from a single runtime machine. By default, the management pack discovers the artifacts on the first machine that is joined to the BizTalk group. However if you want plan to discover the artifacts on the machine of your choice then you must use the override feature to change the settings for automatic discovery. To use an override to change the setting for automatic discovery, see [Optional Configurations](../technical-guides/optional-configurations.md).  
  
 The actions and tasks that are carried from the SCOM Operations Console are unique to the artifacts that are discovered and monitored on all runtime machines. To see all the tasks the BizTalk Server Management Pack provides, click **Tasks** in the Monitoring pane of the Operations Manager 2007 R2/2012 Operations Console.
