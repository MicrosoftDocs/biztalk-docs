# Preparing the Disaster Recovery BizTalk Servers
Install [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] run-time servers at the disaster recovery site following the recommendations in [BizTalk Server 2010 Installation and Upgrade Guides](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=194815) (<https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=194815>). Configure these [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] run-time servers using the BizTalk Configuration Wizard to join them to the production BizTalk group. When configuring the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] run-time servers at the disaster recovery site (including the disaster recovery Enterprise Single Sign-On Master Secret server) make sure to:

- Select **No** to the question “Is this the master secret server?”

- Select **Join** to the question “Do you want to create or join a BizTalk Server group?”

  After configuring the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] run-time disaster recovery servers, create BizTalk host instances on the disaster recovery site that correspond to the production site host instances, but do not start these host instances. For example, if the production site has three Hosts **Send**, **Receive**, and **Orchestration** with instances on server1, server2, and server3, create three corresponding host instances on DRserver1, DRserver2, DRserver3.

> [!NOTE]
>  All [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)]-related Windows services such as the BizTalk Host Instance and Rules Engine Service at the disaster recovery site should be set to “disabled” in the Services Manager to prevent the disaster recovery site from performing any processing.

 You can install and configure a different number of [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] run-time servers in the disaster recovery site than are running in production. Use caution when taking this approach however, so as to avoid overloading the servers in the disaster recovery site if a disaster recovery event occurs. Once the BizTalk group as represented by the set of databases is fully restored, and all required system changes are performed for the BizTalk group, scripts can be run to join the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] run-time servers to the BizTalk group.
