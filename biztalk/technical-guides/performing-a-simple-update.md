# Performing a Simple Update
A simple update of a BizTalk application or artifact requires no downtime, requires no code changes, and can be performed by an IT Pro or business analyst singlehandedly. These types of changes are typically as simple as adding an additional send port to a send port group, adding an additional send port with appropriate subscription filters, changing the URI of a send port, or updating a rule in the BRE. For more information, see [Creating and Using Business Rules](../core/creating-and-using-business-rules.md) (<https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=155136>) in [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Help.
