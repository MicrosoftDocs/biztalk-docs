# Security Considerations
You may have to customize your management pack. Certain accounts cannot be run in a low-privilege environment or must have minimum permissions. For additional details about security considerations and configuring low-privilege accounts, refer to the Operations Manager 2007 R2/2012 Security Guide at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=198196](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=198196).
