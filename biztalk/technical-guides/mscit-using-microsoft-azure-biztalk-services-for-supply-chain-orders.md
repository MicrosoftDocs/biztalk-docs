 **Applies To:** Microsoft Azure BizTalk Services (MABS) and BizTalk Server 2013

 **Summary:** The Manufacturing, Supply Chain, and Information Services (MSCIS) group is a Global Supply Chain Management group at Microsoft. Every year, Microsoft launches new products. MSCIS is responsible for bringing these new products to market. To support these products, new partners are added to the Supply Chain, including Supplier, Manufacturer, Distributor, Retailer, Service Center, Carrier, and so on.

 The number of partner transactions increases yearly. During high load, there are issues related to throughput. While the Supply Chain BizTalk hub processes more transactions (increased volume), the end system or partner system is not able to keep up.

 The current challenge is to prepare the business-to-business (B2B) systems for peak sales. As part of Technology Adoption Program (TAP), MSCIS is exploring Platform as a Service (PaaS) using Microsoft Azure BizTalk Services (MABS). MABS provides key capabilities that can solve the scale situation. MSCIS created a Proof of Concept (POC) involving a hybrid solution that uses Microsoft Azure BizTalk Services (MABS) and BizTalk Server 2013. The requirement is to provide flawless execution from end-to-end, including the ability to scale up for peak sales and scale down for normal sales.

 This white paper discusses the solutions tested using Microsoft Azure BizTalk Services (MABS) and BizTalk Server 2013.
