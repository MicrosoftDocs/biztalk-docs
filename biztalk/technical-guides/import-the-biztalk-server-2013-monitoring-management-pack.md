    2.  In the Administrator pane, click **Agent Managed**.

    3.  Double-click an agent in the list.

    4.  On the Security tab, select **Allow this agent to act as a proxy and discover managed objects on other computers**.

    5.  Repeat steps 3 through 4 for each agent that is installed on a BizTalk Server.
