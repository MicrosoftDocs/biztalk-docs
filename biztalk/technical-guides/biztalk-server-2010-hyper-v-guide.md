# BizTalk Server 2010 Hyper-V Guide

The purpose of this guide is to provide practical guidance for using Microsoft BizTalk Server with Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsWinSvr2k8R2](../includes/btswinsvr2k8r2-md.md)] Hyper-V. The emphasis is on [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], but the performance evaluation methods and performance testing scenarios are useful for analyzing the performance of virtualized server applications in general. This guidance will be of interest to both the IT Pro and Developer communities.

Server virtualization offers companies the opportunity to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine. This capability enables the consolidation of underutilized servers onto a smaller number of fully utilized machines. By implementing virtualization, companies can minimize operational and capital expenditure costs associated with deploying and operating the servers required for enterprise applications.

 The potential costs savings has prompted IT departments to evaluate new and existing applications to identify candidates suitable for server virtualization. Most such evaluations seek to discover the total cost of virtualization. The total cost of virtualization is the sum of monetary costs for hardware and IT operations, and the performance cost of virtualization as compared to the performance attainable in a physical environment. This guide focuses exclusively on the performance aspect of virtualization.

 Beginning with Windows Server 2008, server virtualization using Hyper-V technology has been an integral part of the operating system. [!INCLUDE[btsWinSvr2k8R2](../includes/btswinsvr2k8r2-md.md)] Hyper-V provides a reliable and optimized virtualization solution enabling organizations to improve server utilization and reduce costs. With the addition of new features such as live migration functionality, expanded processor and memory support for host systems, support for dynamic virtual machine storage, it allows organizations to consolidate workloads onto a single physical server and is a good solution for organizations who are consolidating servers as well as for development and test environments.

 BizTalk Server takes advantage of the latest virtualization improvements included as part of [!INCLUDE[btsWinSvr2k8R2](../includes/btswinsvr2k8r2-md.md)] Hyper-V, which can lead to reduced costs through production server consolidation and business continuity management, plus the creation of a more dynamic IT infrastructure. The Clustering capability allows BizTalk Server to be deployed in multi-site clustering environments without additional software or hardware. Hyper-V provides support to run several instances of BizTalk Server on virtualized instances of [!INCLUDE[btsWinSvr2k8R2](../includes/btswinsvr2k8r2-md.md)]. Server Virtualization enables BizTalk customers to minimize the hardware footprint of a BizTalk deployment by consolidating underutilized resources in a secure manner.

 A BizTalk Server deployment typically consists of a number of other components including: SQL Server, Windows Server and Internet Information Services (IIS). Hyper-V provides support for dynamic provisioning through System Center Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) which makes provisioning on demand a realistic scenario.

 [!INCLUDE[btsWinSvr2k8R2](../includes/btswinsvr2k8r2-md.md)] provides the Hyper-V technology to accommodate server consolidation through virtualization of multiple operating system instances onto a single physical server. Hyper-V is provided as a core part of [!INCLUDE[btsWinSvr2k8R2](../includes/btswinsvr2k8r2-md.md)] or as a stand-alone product to make it as easy as possible for customers to embrace virtualization in their organization. There are several key scenarios for implementing Hyper-V:

- **Server Consolidation** – Minimize server footprint, operational and capital expenditure (TCO) associated with running applications by consolidating multiple physical servers onto one box.

- **Testing and Development** – Using virtual machines, developers and architects can quickly provision new machines to try out new technology and scenarios in a safe environment that accurately reflects the characteristics of a physical environment. Virtualization enables new machines to be provisioned running on a wide platform of operating systems without new hardware being required. This provides a great platform for testing and development environments.

- **Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery**: Hyper-V includes powerful business continuity and disaster recovery features such as live backup and quick migration, which enables businesses to meet their service level agreements.

  > For information about how to use the Hyper-V Live Migration Feature available in Windows Server 2008 R2, see [“Hyper-V: Step-by-Step Guide to Using Live Migration in Windows Server 2008 R2”](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-r2-and-2008/dd349801(v=ws.10)).

- **Dynamic Data Center**: By combining Hyper-V with the Microsoft System Center suite of tools, organizations can automate virtual machine configuration and monitoring. For more information, see [System Center Virtual Machine Manager](/system-center/vmm/whats-new-in-vmm).

  The information in this guide directly relates to the Server Consolidation and Testing and Development scenarios for Hyper-V. The other two scenarios are out of scope for this guide.
