# Scaling a Production BizTalk Server Environment
This section provides an overview of the lab environment that was used to perform load testing of a BizTalk Server solution, a summary of the load test results, and general observations and recommendations based upon the findings in the lab.  
  
 The information provided in these topics can and should be used as a guide for scaling your [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] environment. In addition to this guidance we recommend that you complete periodic load testing throughout the development cycle of your [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] application.
