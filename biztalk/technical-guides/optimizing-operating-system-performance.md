# Optimizing Operating System Performance
This section provides recommendations for optimizing performance of the BizTalk Server computers used in a production BizTalk Server environment. The optimizations listed in this section are applied after BizTalk Server has been installed and configured.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Some of the recommendations in this section require modifications to the Windows Server registry. Incorrect use of Registry Editor may cause problems requiring you to reinstall your operating system. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For more information about how to back up, restore, and modify the registry, see the Microsoft Knowledge Base article [Windows registry information for advanced users](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=62729) (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=62729).
