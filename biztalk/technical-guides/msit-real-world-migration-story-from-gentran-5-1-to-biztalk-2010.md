 **Applies To:** BizTalk Server 2010, Gentran Server

 **Summary:** The Microsoft IT (MSIT) integration platform uses BizTalk Server and Gentran. Until recently, Microsoft IT had a good presence of Gentran footprints. With BizTalk Server supporting cloud computing and AS2/EDI capabilities, there is an opportunity to replace Gentran with Microsoft BizTalk Server 2010.  Gentran supports Windows Server 2003 and SQL server 2005; which are in extended support that is soon ending. There is no roadmap for Gentran to support newer platforms, including Windows Server 2008/2012 and SQL Server 2008/2014.

 MSIT viewed this as an opportunity to:

- Get to the newer technology platforms

- Remove the supportability constraints

- Simplify the overall architecture of the integration platform

- Make the integration platform more cost effective and robust

  BizTalk Server 2010 is a proven integration platform, has numerous capabilities and features, and supports the new platform technologies.

  This white paper discusses the strategy and steps taken to migrate from Gentran 5.1 to BizTalk Server.
