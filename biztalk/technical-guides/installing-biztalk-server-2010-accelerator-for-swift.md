 **Installing BizTalk Server 2010 Accelerator for SWIFT**  
  
 **Writer:** Maria Quian, Microsoft Corporation  
  
 **Technical Reviewers:** Andres Naranjo, Mandi Ohlinger  
  
 **Published:** June 2012  
  
 **Applies To:** BizTalk Server 2010 Accelerator for SWIFT  
  
 **Summary:** The foundation for a successful installation of Microsoft BizTalk Server 2010 Accelerator for SWIFT (A4SWIFT) is an understanding of the A4SWIFT features and the BizTalk components on which each feature depends. Each A4SWIFT feature depends on other properly configured BizTalk components. Other considerations that affect building an A4SWIFT environment include an existing network infrastructure and an already configured BizTalk Server environment. This document will refer and use the existing documentation for building BizTalk Server environments. A4SWIFT inherits all software and hardware requirements for BizTalk Server 2010.  
  
 An installation guide is available for each A4SWIFT related component but not a single compiled document that elaborates on the installation/configuration steps. This document will bring them together and identify some of the common issues encountered during installation and configuration.
