# Log Shipping User Accounts and Roles
BizTalk Server log shipping is driven by a SQL Server Agent job to automate the process of restoring backups and logs. Incorrect permissions can cause restore operations performed by BizTalk Server log shipping to fail. The user account configured to restore databases must have access to the production database instance that hosts the BizTalk Management database. In most cases this means that the service account for the SQL Server Agent job driving the BizTalk Server log shipping job on the disaster recovery [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] instance requires a login and permissions on the production database instance that hosts the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] management database. This assumes that the SQL Server Agent service account is configured as the job owner.  

 BizTalk Server includes a SQL Server role named BTS_BACKUP_USERS so that the user account configured to restore databases does not require SQL Server System Administrators permission.  

 When configuring the user account that will perform database restore operations as part of BizTalk Server log shipping, please verify the following:  

- Configure the SQL Server Agent service to run under a domain account with a mapped user configured in [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] Management Studio (in **Security**, **Logins**) on each [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] instance that hosts [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] databases restored by the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] log shipping jobs.  

- Configure a [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] login account for this user, and assign this user to the BizTalk BTS_BACKUP_USERS SQL role on each server.  

- Assign this user to the [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] System Administrators role on the computer running [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] that houses the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] management database.  

- The account that performs backup and restore operations must have Read and Write access to the UNC share where backup files are created.
