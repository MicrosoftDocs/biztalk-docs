# Restoring the BizTalk Group
The BizTalk group is represented by the set of [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] Analysis Services databases, SSIS packages, and SQL Agent Jobs. This section describes the process for restoring the BizTalk group.  
  
 In the event that a switchover to the destination system (disaster recovery site) is required, the following steps must be completed:  
  
1. Restore [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] and Analysis Services databases.  
  
2. Restore BizTalk Server runtime servers and applications.  
  
   Upon completion of these steps, the BizTalk group has been established at the disaster recovery site, the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] runtime servers can be configured, and the applications can be deployed into the BizTalk group. The topics in this section cover the details of this process.
