# Checklist: Deploying an Application
This topic describes the steps involved in deploying a BizTalk application and its artifacts in a production environment. It demonstrates how to deploy an application in the development environment, export it into an .msi file, and then import it into the production environment from the .msi file.

 Application deployment consists of importing the application into a group and installing the application on individual servers (host instances) in the group. For more information about importing and installing applications, see [How to Import an Application from an .msi File](../technical-guides/how-to-import-an-application-from-an-msi-file.md).

 For more information about application deployment, see [The Application Deployment Process](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=154716) (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=154716).

|Import the BizTalk application into the production environment from the .msi file.

|Make any additional modifications to the BizTalk application in the production environment so it runs in that environment, such as changing port configurations.

|If you have made any additional modifications to the BizTalk application in the production environment, install the BizTalk application from the .msi file into any other computers in the production environment that will run it.<br /><br /> Also, import the application into any other BizTalk groups where you want to deploy it, and if the application includes file-based artifacts, install the application on the servers in those groups.|-   [How to Install a BizTalk Application](../core/how-to-install-a-biztalk-application.md) (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=154728).<br />-   [How to Import an Application from an .msi File](../technical-guides/how-to-import-an-application-from-an-msi-file.md)<br />-   "Importing a BizTalk Application" section of [Best Practices for Deploying an Application](./best-practices-for-deploying-an-application.md)<br />-   "Importing a BizTalk Application" section of [Known Issues with Deploying an Application](../technical-guides/known-issues-with-deploying-an-application.md)|
|Start the BizTalk application in the production environment from the BizTalk Server Administration console and verify that it is functioning correctly.|-   [How to Start and Stop a BizTalk Application](../core/how-to-start-and-stop-a-biztalk-application.md) (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=154729).<br />-   [Testing an Application](../technical-guides/testing-an-application.md)|
