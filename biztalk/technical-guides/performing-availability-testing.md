# Performing Availability Testing
You should test your system for disaster recovery to verify its ability to recover from various levels of failure, ranging from small-scale failures (such as a network card failure) to the loss of a production server. Your disaster recovery testing should include the following steps:

- **Test individual hardware component failure.**

   You should test the ability of the system to recover from an individual hardware component failure, such as a network or disk.

- **Test single BizTalk server failure.**

   In most [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] production environments, host processing is spread out among multiple computers running [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] in a single BizTalk group. What is the ability of the BizTalk group to continue host processing in the event one of the servers in the group fails?

- **Test cluster node failover.**

   If Windows Clustering is used to provide high availability for the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] databases or BizTalk Hosts, you should verify cluster node failover functionality. For more information about using Windows Clustering to provide high availability for [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], see [Checklist: Providing High Availability with Fault Tolerance or Load Balancing](../technical-guides/checklist-providing-high-availability-with-fault-tolerance-or-load-balancing.md).

- **Test recovery of BizTalk Server databases using log shipping.**

   You should verify the recovery of the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] databases. For more information about using log shipping to back up and restore [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] databases, see [What Is BizTalk Server Log Shipping?](../technical-guides/what-is-biztalk-server-log-shipping.md) in this guide or [Log Shipping](../core/log-shipping.md) (<https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=153450>).

   For a checklist of steps that you should follow to increase the availability of a [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] environment using disaster recovery, see [Checklist: Increasing Availability with Disaster Recovery](../technical-guides/checklist-increasing-availability-with-disaster-recovery.md).
