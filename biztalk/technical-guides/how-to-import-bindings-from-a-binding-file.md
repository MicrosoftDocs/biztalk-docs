# How to Import Bindings from a Binding File
You can import the bindings of a BizTalk application into another existing BizTalk application by using a binding file. You can also import all the bindings for a group into a group or the bindings of an assembly into an application.

-   For information about various considerations to keep in mind when importing bindings, see [Importing Bindings](../core/importing-bindings2.md) (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=155012).
