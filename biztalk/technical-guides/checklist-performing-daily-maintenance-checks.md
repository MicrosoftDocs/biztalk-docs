# Checklist: Performing Daily Maintenance Checks
This topic describes some of the items that you should check on a daily basis to help monitor the status of a [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] system. You must perform most of these checks consistently and archive the results over a period of time to obtain the greatest benefit. We recommend that you automate routine maintenance checks whenever possible.

|Steps|Reference|
|-----------|---------------|
|Check for failed disks in the hardware RAID (reliability check).|[Manage Disks](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc771607(v=ws.11)) (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=158666).|
|Check for messages requiring manual intervention such as suspended messages (reliability check).|For information about manually checking for suspended messages, see [Investigating Orchestration, Port, and Message Failures](../core/investigating-orchestration-port-and-message-failures.md) (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=154512).|
|Check for any errors or issues with the various databases associated with BizTalk Server, especially the MessageBox database.|Run the BizTalk MsgBoxViewer tool available from [BizTalk MsgBoxViewer - download here the latest version of the tool](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=151930) (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=151930). This tool analyzes the BizTalk MessageBox and other databases and generates an HTML report containing warnings, if any and other information related to the databases. **Tip:**  You can also save the reports for later use. These reports might be useful when troubleshooting issues with the BizTalk application. **Note:**  Use of this tool is not supported by Microsoft, and Microsoft makes no guarantees about the suitability of this programs.
