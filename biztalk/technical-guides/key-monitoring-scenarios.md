# Key Monitoring Scenarios
The [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Management Pack for Operations Manager 2007 R2/2012 includes a number of key monitoring scenarios described in the table that follows.  
  
### BizTalk Server Monitoring Scenarios  
  
|Scenario|Description|  
|--------------|-----------------|  
|Suspended Message Alerts|Monitoring and resolving issues related to suspended messages are common operational tasks in a BizTalk Server environment. The BizTalk Server Management Pack enables you to monitor and troubleshoot suspended message events in a streamlined way. Two kinds of message suspension occur in BizTalk Server when you process messages: Inbound Message Suspension and Outbound Message Suspension.<br /><br /> For inbound messages, various kinds of processing failures or lack of subscription may cause a message to be suspended. Some transports can be configured to suspend the message or not suspend the message. For outbound messages, all processing failures will always lead to message suspension.<br /><br /> For inbound messages, alert rules for suspension are written per adapter. This approach provides more flexibility in handling message suspensions on the inbound side. You can add different response actions based on the adapter, such as notification. You can additionally customize the BizTalk Server Management Pack by creating custom rules. For outbound messages, all messages are always suspended on transmission time failure of any kind.|  
|Alert Suppression Policy|Rules for suspended messages employ a different suppression policy than are generally applied for other rules. Alerts are suppressed based the Alert Name, Alert Source, and Computer and Domain.<br /><br /> For suppression based on Alert Source, the alert source for each suspended message rule also contains a parameter extracted from the suspended message event. This parameter is the URI on which the message was received or transmitted.<br /><br /> Errors that occur on the same URI are usually because of the same reason. Therefore, we recommend that you create a single alert for the same root cause even though multiple associated failure events exist. This enables you to have one alert and one root cause that makes it easier for you to correct problems when they occur. Streamlined alerts, based on URIs, reduce unnecessary alerts and facilitate efficient tracking of open issues. A new alert is created for a message suspension at a URI with no previous suspension alerts.|  
|BAM Technical Assistance Alerts|Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) Portal users, known as business users, usually understand the business level indicators and business activities. They use BAM Portal to monitor aggregate indicators, complete in-process business transactions, or search for transactions with particular properties to investigate further. However, business users often do not understand the aspects of an issue at an IT infrastructure level. During investigation of a given transaction, the BAM Portal enables business users to request technical assistance from the IT Operations staff to investigate transactions at the IT infrastructure level.<br /><br /> The BAM Portal enables this hand-off from the business user through a Technical Assistance request. Requesting technical assistance creates an entry in the Application log in Event Viewer of the computer where the BAM Portal is hosted. This event contains details about the activity on which technical assistance is requested by the user and other important information, such as the Message Instance Identifier, Service Instance Identifier, and BizTalk Server group information.<br /><br /> The BizTalk Server Management Pack contains a rule to trigger an alert on detection of a BAM Technical Assistance event. The rule that creates this alert is “Error: BAM Technical Assistance Required.” A new alert is created for each request submitted from the BAM Portal.|  
|BizTalk Message Boxes and Hosts|BizTalk Server Management Pack incorporates performance threshold rules that provide a comprehensive view of the health of the BizTalk MessageBox databases and queues. Two kinds of threshold rules are provided:<br /><br /> -   Rules that apply generically, that is, to all BizTalk Hosts, all BizTalk MessageBox databases.<br />-   Rules that are specific to a particular BizTalk Host or a MessageBox.<br /><br /> Generic rules monitor all the BizTalk Server Hosts or MessageBox databases based on a common threshold. For example, the rule “Monitor HostQ Size,” monitors the work queues of all BizTalk Server Hosts based on a common threshold. If three hosts exist, all their work queues are monitored by the same rule and alerts occur when any of the host work queues cross the common threshold.<br /><br /> BizTalk Server host-specific rules enable you to configure different thresholds for different hosts and MessageBox databases. For example, the rule "Monitor HostQ Size – BizTalkServerApplication" is a host-specific rule that monitors the work queue of the BizTalkServerApplication host. You do this by defining a specific Operations Manager provider for the particular performance counter instance and using that provider in the threshold rule.<br /><br /> Host\MessageBox-specific rules are provided as template rules to be used as a guide for creating rules that are applicable in your environment. Generic rules need to be configured with threshold values specific to your environment. BizTalk Host/MessageBox-specific rules need to be created based on the template rules and appropriate thresholds.<br /><br /> BizTalk Server incorporates self-throttling, which helps to prevent overloading based on various parameters. A temporary overload that causes throttling to occur is not an operationally significant event. Persistent throttling, however, is not expected in a stable environment and could indicate underlying problems at the infrastructure level. The BizTalk Server Management Pack provides proactive monitoring of such persistent throttling conditions with performance threshold monitors based on the following conditions:<br /><br /> -   BizTalk Server service process memory<br />-   Number of messages being processed<br />-   Number of threads in a BizTalk Server process<br />-   Size of the BizTalk database queues|  
|Orchestration Failures|Monitoring for suspended orchestrations is another common scenario. Orchestrations can fail for many reasons that include orchestration engine problems, .NET Component failures, and program logic. It is important to enable an operator to determine the source of the problem quickly and to resume suspended orchestrations when fixed.|  
|Service Monitoring|BizTalk Server requires that a number of services are running to operate correctly. The status of these services will be mapped to monitors for the classes representing the different BizTalk Services.|  
|Application Monitoring|BizTalk Server introduced the concept of an application for grouping solution artifacts. Application monitoring detects effects of a failure at the application level.|
