# Install AppFabric Connect for Services in BizTalk Server

This guide provides instructions on how to install BizTalk Server 2010 Feature Pack (October 2010). The feature pack installs BizTalk Server 2010 AppFabric Connect for Services feature that provides enhancements to the **BizTalk WCF Service Publishing Wizard** and the **WCF Adapter Service Development Wizard**. After you have installed the feature pack, you will be able to extend the reach of your on-premises BizTalk Server artifacts or LOB applications to cloud by adding a Windows Azure AppFabric Service Bus endpoint.

## Prerequisites
 BizTalk Server 2010 Feature Pack provides enhancements to the BizTalk WCF Service Publishing Wizard and the WCF Adapter Service Development Wizard. While the BizTalk WCF Service Publishing Wizard is available with BizTalk Server 2010 Developer Tools, WCF Adapter Service Development Wizard is available with BizTalk Adapter Pack 2010. So, before you install the feature pack, you must have either BizTalk Server 2010 Developer Tools or BizTalk Adapter Pack 2010 or both installed. If you have only one of these installed, only the wizard relevant to the parent product installation will be updated as part of the feature pack installation.

 Other than this, there are some prerequisites for using these wizards. The complete list of prerequisites for each wizard is listed in the topics describing how to use the wizards. The links to the topics are provided under [Using AppFabric Connect for Services](../technical-guides/installing-appfabric-connect-for-services.md#BKMK_Using).
