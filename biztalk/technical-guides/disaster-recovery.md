# Disaster Recovery
Disaster recovery procedures improve system availability by employing steps to resume operation of a failed system. Disaster recovery differs from fault tolerance in that disaster recovery typically requires manual intervention to restore the failed system whereas a fault-tolerant design can continue to operate without manual intervention if the system encounters a failure condition.
