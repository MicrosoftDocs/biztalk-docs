# Prepare the Disaster Recovery Site
BizTalk Server log shipping has two supported scenarios. One is where log shipping for all databases on all production instances of [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] is applied to a single disaster recovery instance of [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)]. The other scenario is where log shipping for the databases for each production instance of [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] is applied to a corresponding instance of [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] at the disaster recovery site. Note that it is fully supported to have the same number of [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] database instances in the disaster recovery site as there is in production but on fewer physical servers. This section provides guidance on these preparations.
