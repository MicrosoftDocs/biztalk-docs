| **advanced programmable interrupt controller (APIC)** | A controller that receives interrupts from various sources and sends them to a processor core for handling. In a multiprocessor system, which can be either a VM or a physical computer, the APIC sends and receive interprocessor interrupt messages to and from other logical processors on the system bus. For more information about the advanced programmable interrupt controller see chapter 8 of the [Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual Volume 3A: System Programming Guide, Part 1](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=148923) (<http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=148923>). |

This usage will be corrected in a future edition of this guide.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

|                  **emulated device**                  |                                                                                                                                             A virtualized device that mimics an actual physical hardware device so that guests can use the typical drivers for that hardware device. Emulated devices are less efficient than synthetic devices, but emulated devices provide support for “unenlightened” operating systems that do not have integration components installed.                                                                                                                                             |
|                   **enlightenment**                   |                                                                    An optimization to a guest operating system to make it aware of VM environments and tune its behavior for VMs. Enlightenments help to reduce the cost of certain operating system functions such as memory management. Enlightenments are accessed through the hypercall interface. Enlightened I/O can utilize the VMBus directly, bypassing any device emulation layer. An operating system that takes advantage of all possible enlightenments is said to be “fully enlightened.”                                                                    |

Guests can be a full-featured operating system or a small, special-purpose kernel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

The Hyper-V virtualization platform allows multiple isolated operating systems to share a single hardware platform.                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Its primary job is to provide isolated execution environments called partitions. The hypervisor controls and arbitrates access to the underlying hardware.                                                                                                                                                                                  |

A logical processor can be a core or a hyper-thread. There can be one or more logical processors per core (more than one if hyper-threading is enabled) and one or more cores per processor socket.                                                                                                                                                                            |

The data and commands are “passed through” to the physical disk (through the root partition’s native storage stack) with no intervening processing by the virtual stack.                                                                                                                                                                                  |

It hosts the virtualization stack and creates and manages the child partitions. The root partition is also known as the parent partition.                                                                                                                                                                      |

Drivers for synthetic devices are included with the integration components (enlightenments) for the guest operating system. The synthetic device drivers use  the VMBus to communicate with the virtualized device software in the root partition.                                                                                                           |
