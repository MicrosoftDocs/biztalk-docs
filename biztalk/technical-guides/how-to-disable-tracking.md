# How to Disable Tracking
This topic describes how to disable tracking using the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console. You can configure various tracking options during runtime for orchestrations, send ports, receive ports, and pipelines using the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console. You can change the tracking options for an item at any time, without interrupting the business process.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform the procedure in this topic, you must be logged on with an account that is a member of the BizTalk Server Administrators group. For more detailed information about permissions, see [Permissions for Managing an Application](../technical-guides/permissions-for-managing-an-application.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you only want to view the tracking options, you can be logged on as a member of [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Operators group.

    -   Clear the **Select all message properties** check box if you do not want to use all the listed properties.  
  
    -   Under **Properties list**, clear the check box of each property that you do not want to use.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You should select only the options that you need, because tracking messages creates performance and storage overhead for your system.  
  
### To disable tracking for a pipeline  
  
1.  Click **Start**, click **Programs**, click **Microsoft** [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3ui](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3ui-md.md)], and then click **BizTalk Server Administration**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you set tracking options on pipelines, you will also set the tracking options globally for every port that uses the pipeline. This, in turn, may result in far more data being tracked than you intended, which will slow system performance. Instead, you can set tracking options on send ports and receive ports.  
  
2.  In the console tree, expand [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3ui](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3ui-md.md)] **Administration**, expand the BizTalk group, expand **Applications**, and then expand the application containing the pipeline for which you want to configure tracking.  
  
3.  Do one of the following:  
  
    -   To disable tracking for one of the default BizTalk pipelines, expand \<All Artifacts\>.  
  
    -   To disable tracking for a custom pipeline that has been deployed into a BizTalk application, expand the application containing the pipeline.  
  
4.  Click the **Pipelines** folder, right-click the pipeline, and then click **Tracking**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  To disable tracking for multiple pipelines at once, hold down the Shift key, click each pipeline to configure, right-click one of the pipelines, and then click **Tracking**.  
  
5.  Disable tracking options as described in the following table, and then click **OK**.  
  
    |Use this|To do this|  
    |--------------|----------------|  
    |**Port start and end events**|Clear this check box to disable tracking only when an instance starts and ends. Details include item name, assembly, and other metadata.|  
    |**Message send and receive events**|Clear this check box to disable the tracking of message send and receive events. This check box is available only if **Port start and end events** is selected.|  
    |**Message before pipeline processing**|Clear this check box to disable saving and tracking of the message bodies received by the pipeline, which holds metadata such as URLs and promoted properties. If this is a receive pipeline, the message body is the raw message as submitted to the pipeline by the transport component. Depending on the application, the message might be encrypted, signed, or encoded. When using a [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] map, if this is a receive pipeline, tracking takes place after the inbound map is processed.<br /><br /> This check box is available only if **Message send and receive events** is selected.|  
    |**Message after pipeline processing**|Clear this check box to disable saving and tracking of the message bodies sent by the pipeline, which holds metadata such as URLs and promoted properties. If this is a receive pipeline, the message body is the processed message to be submitted to the MessageBox database, which may be XML depending on your application. When using a [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] map, if this is a send pipeline, tracking takes place before the outbound map is processed.<br /><br /> This check box is available only if **Message send and receive events** is selected.|
