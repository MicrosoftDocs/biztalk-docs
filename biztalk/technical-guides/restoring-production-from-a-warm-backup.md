# Restoring Production from a Warm Backup
If the source system becomes unreliable, it is possible to restore the databases from the destination to the source. Perform the following procedure to restore databases from the destination to the source.  
  
### To restore the databases from the destination to the source follow these steps  
  
1. Disable all backup jobs on the source (production) [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] instance(s).  
  
2. Wait for all restore jobs to complete on the destination disaster recovery (DR) [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] instance(s).  
  
3. Disable all restore jobs on the destination (DR) [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] instance(s).  
  
4. Restore all databases with STOPATMARK on the destination (DR) [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] instance(s).  
  
5. Stop all [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] services on all BizTalk servers.  
  
6. Drop all [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)]-related databases on the source (production) [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] instance(s).  
  
7. Back up (full) all databases on the destination (DR) [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] instance(s).  
  
8. Restore (full) all [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] databases backed up in step 7 to the source (production) [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] instance(s).  
  
9. Restart all BizTalk servers including the master secret server.  
  
10. Drop all [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)]-related databases on the destination (DR) [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] instance(s).  
  
11. Enable backup jobs on the source [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] instance(s).  
  
12. Enable restore jobs on the destination (DR) [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] instance(s).
