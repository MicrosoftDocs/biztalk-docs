# Tools for Testing
The table below lists tools that you can use to perform the testing associated with operational readiness of [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)].

| Testing  |  Tool  |  Use   |
|---|---|---|
| **Unit and Functional Testing** |   Microsoft Visual Studio  |   Used for unit testing .NET code. For more information about the testing functionality that is available with Visual Studio, see [Testing the Application](/azure/devops/test/overview).  |
|  |   BizUnit  |  A framework designed for automated testing of BizTalk solutions. **Note:**  Use of this tool is not supported by Microsoft, and Microsoft makes no guarantees about the suitability of this programs. Use of this program is entirely at your own risk. <br /><br /> For more information about BizUnit, see [BizUnit - Framework for Automated Testing of Distributed Systems](https://github.com/BizUnit/BizUnit).  |
|   |   NUnit   |   Used for unit testing .NET code. **Note:**  Use of this tool is not supported by Microsoft, and Microsoft makes no guarantees about the suitability of this programs.

|    **Code Coverage Testing**    |   Visual Studio 2010 Code Coverage  |   Used to ensure that all execution paths through your application are adequately exercised, and to identify dead functions or classes in your code. In general, code that is unreachable or never executed should be removed. For more information about the code coverage feature of Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 see [Using Code Coverage to Determine How Much Code Is Being Tested](/visualstudio/test/using-code-coverage-to-determine-how-much-code-is-being-tested?viewFallbackFrom=vs-2015).  |
|     **Performance Testing**     |   Performance Analysis of Logs (PAL) Tool  |  Tool for analyzing performance counter log files.<br /><br /> For more information about the Performance Analysis of Logs (PAL) tool, see [Performance Analysis of Logs (PAL) Tool](https://github.com/clinthuffman/PAL).     |
|  |   Microsoft BizTalk LoadGen 2007 tool  |   Load generation tool used to run performance and stress tests against [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)].<br /><br /> Download [LoadGen](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=14925).    |
|   |   Visual Studio 2010 load testing   |   Available with Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate edition, allows you to simulate load from up to 250 users by default, and over 250 users using Visual Studio Load Test Virtual User Pack. For more information about performing load testing using Visual Studio see [Testing Application Performance and Stress](/previous-versions/dd293540(v=vs.140)).   |
|   | BizTalk Server Orchestration Profiler |   Used to view orchestration tracking data for a specified period of time; helpful for determining where performance bottlenecks exist in orchestrations. **Note:**  Use of this tool is not supported by Microsoft, and Microsoft makes no guarantees about the suitability of this programs.
