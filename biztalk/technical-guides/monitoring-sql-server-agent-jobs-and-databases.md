# Monitoring SQL Server Agent Jobs and Databases
[!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] includes multiple [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] Agent jobs that perform important functions to keep your servers operational and healthy. You should monitor the health of these jobs and ensure that they are running without errors. The Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] Management Pack contains rules for monitoring items such as SQL databases and [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] Agent jobs. You should configure the [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] Management Pack for comprehensive monitoring of all [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] databases and [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] Agent jobs.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] management pack includes two disabled rules for monitoring the health of two of the most important BizTalk [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] Agent jobs:  
  
- Critical Error: A BizTalk SQL Server Agent job failed - Backup BizTalk Server  
  
- Critical Error: A BizTalk SQL Server Agent job failed â€“ Tracked Message Copy  
  
  To monitor all BizTalk Server [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] Agent jobs from within the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] management pack, you must enable these rules and create additional rules for other jobs that you want to monitor using the following process.  
  
- In the Operations Manager Administrator console, create a copy of either of the two preceding rules in the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Core Rule group, and rename the rule appropriately.  
  
- In the criteria section for the rule, change the wildcard comparison for Parameter 1 appropriately.  
  
- In some cases, job names are dependent on database names that the user creates, for example, the name of the MessageBox database.  
  
- Your rule can be targeted either towards a job associated with a single MessageBox or all MessageBoxes.
