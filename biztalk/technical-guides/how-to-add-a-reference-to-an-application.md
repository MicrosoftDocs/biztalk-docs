# How to Add a Reference to an Application
This topic provides information about using the BizTalk Server Administration console to add a reference from one application to another. You add a reference when you want to use an artifact in the current application that already exists in another application in the same BizTalk group. If you want to use the EDI-specific schemas, pipelines, and orchestrations (deployed in the BizTalk EDI Application) from another application such as BizTalk Application 1, you must add a reference to the BizTalk EDI Application. You should not add custom artifacts to the BizTalk EDI Application.

 For information about:

- Adding a reference to another application, see [How to Add a Reference to Another Application](../core/how-to-add-a-reference-to-another-application.md) (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=155011).

- Adding a reference to the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] EDI application, see [How to Add a Reference to the BizTalk Server EDI Application](/previous-versions/) (<https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=155026>).
