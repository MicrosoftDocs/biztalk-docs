# Update References to the BAM Archive Database Name
If you backed up your BAM Archive databases, in the event of a system or data failure you can restore that backup to a different computer, and you can rename the backup.  
  
 To restore the BAM Archive databases, perform the steps in [How to Restore Databases in the Backup BizTalk Server Job](../technical-guides/how-to-restore-databases-in-the-backup-biztalk-server-job.md). In addition, you must update the BAM SSIS packages with the new server name and database name.
