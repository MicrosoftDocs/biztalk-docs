# Routine Maintenance Checklists
This section lists the maintenance checks that should be performed on a [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] system on a routine basis as part of a preventive maintenance program. Performing these checks will help you determine whether there are reliability, administration, security, or performance issues with the system.  
  
 The topics in this section provide links to monitoring and maintenance topics, both inside and outside this document, for the maintenance checks.
