# Checklist: Planning for Operations in a Secure Environment

Running [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] in a secure environment requires additional steps for deployment and configuration. While default operating system installations need not take these into account, but scenarios where restrictive security policies have been applied, you should take into account information in this section. The level of restriction applied onto servers may vary but information below should cover most cases and would be a good starting point.

- [Security Considerations for Computers Running SQL Server](#security-considerations-for-computers-running-sql-server)

- [Additional Security Considerations](#additional-security-considerations)

## Security Considerations for Computers Running BizTalk Server

The following information suggests the security-related settings on computers running [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)].

### User Rights Assignment
 
To start the User Rights Assignment MMC Snap-in, click **Start**, click **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Local Security Policy**. In the **Local Security Policy** MMC snap-in, expand **Security Settings**, expand **Local Policies**, and then click **User Rights Assignment**.

|Policy setting|Values|Reference and details|
|--------------------|------------|---------------------------|
|Log on as a service|BizTalk Application Users|Required to run BizTalk Host Instances. For more information about different user accounts, see [Windows Groups and User Accounts in BizTalk Server](../core/windows-groups-and-user-accounts-in-biztalk-server.md). |
