# Install BizTalk Server 2013 and 2013 R2
Lists the steps to install [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)].  

## Before you get started

- **Account names** – Use the default account names whenever possible. The [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] setup automatically enters the default accounts. If there are multiple [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] groups within the Domain, change the account names to avoid conflicts. If you change the names, [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] supports only \<*NetBIOS domain name*\>\\<*user*\> for service accounts and Windows groups.  

- **Account names with BAM Management Web Service** – [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] does not support built-in accounts or accounts without passwords for the BAM Management Web Service User. The web service accesses the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] database and these accounts may suggest a security threat.  

  > [!NOTE]
  >  Configuring [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] with these typs of accounts may succeed, but the BAM Management Web Service fails. Built-in accounts or accounts without passwords can be used for the BAM Application pool.  

- **BizTalk Assembly Viewer** – Not supported on a 64-bit platform.  

- **Install and Uninstall** – Uninstalling [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] requires manually deleting the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] databases. If you are installing [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] as a developer or evaluator, use a virtual machine. If you need to reinstall, you can easily roll back the virtual machine without having to uninstall and delete the databases.  

- **32-bit and 64-bit computers** – There are few differences when installing [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] on 32-bit or 64-bit computer. The installation and configuration covers 32-bit and 64-bit computers. Any differences are noted.  

- **Workgroups** - Installing and configuring [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] in the workgroup environment on a single computer is supported. SQL Server and [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] features and components are installed and configured on the same computer.  

- **Terminal Server** – Installing [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] using Terminal Server running in application mode is not supported. See [KB 832027](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/832027).  

- **BAM Portal**  - If the BAM portal is configured on a website used by applications that are running .NET Framework 2.0, then create a new website for the BAM portal:  

   [Create an IIS 7 web site](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc772350\(WS.10\).aspx)  

   [Create an IIS 8 web site](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh831515.aspx)  

   After creating the new website:  

  1. Open **[!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Configuration**.  

  2. Configure the BAM portal and select the new website from the **BAM Portal Web Site** list.  

- **Community Additions**: Read:

7. Accept the default installation location, or select **Browse** to enter another location to install [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)]. Select **Next**.  

8. If your computer is missing a prerequisite component, such as ADOMD.NET, Setup can install the redistributable prerequisites. You can either:  

   -   Select **Automatically install the redistributable prerequisites from the web**  

        OR  

   -   Select **Automatically install the redistributable prerequisites from a CAB file** if you have downloaded the CAB file. If you select this, you can then browse to the location of the CAB file.  

9. In **Summary**, verify that the components are correct. To enable auto-logon after a system reboot, select **Set**, and enter your logon information. Auto-logon is enabled only for reboots during setup, and is disabled when setup is complete.  

10. Select **Install** to start the installation process.  

11. In **Microsoft Update Setup**, choose your preference, and select **Next**.  

12. In **Installation Completed**, uncheck **Launch [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Configuration**, and then select **Finish**.  

## Additional  

- When you installed SQL Server, SQL Server setup granted your logged-on account System Administrator rights. Since these rights are also required for installing [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], you must do one of the following:  

  -   Use the same account you used when you installed SQL Server.  

  -   Give the logged on account System Administrator rights.  

- After you download the self-extracting EXE for [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], the installation guide is opened. The Setup.exe for [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] is at the same location as the installation guide.  

- Instead of installing [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] on a physical computer, you can o configure a [!INCLUDE[winazure](../includes/winazure-md.md)] virtual machine with a [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] image. See [Configuring BizTalk Server on an Azure VM](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/jj248689.aspx).  

- For the steps to install [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] using a command prompt, see [Appendix A: Silent Installation](../install-and-config-guides/appendix-a-silent-installation.md).
