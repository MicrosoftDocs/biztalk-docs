# BizTalk Server 2020: What's New, and Installation

## Get started with BizTalk Server 2020

This release builds on the world's leading integration broker with full support of new features introduced in the BizTalk 2016 Feature Packs, updated platform support, and new features. Support for the latest Microsoft platform makes this the safest BizTalk Server release, and enables a seamless hybrid integration. Several features in this release are running successfully in production environments with enterprise customers.

Traditionally, integration has been either on-premises system-to-system EAI (Enterprise Application Integration), or business-to-business (B2B). Many companies want to integrate with systems beyond the corporate firewall. These systems are often SaaS-based, API-centric providers handling everything from sales leads to invoicing, email, and social media. Microsoft BizTalk Server 2020 allows customers to integrate disparate applications and heterogeneous data to deliver a variety of solutions, including payment processing, supply chain management, business-to-business EDI, real-time decision making, and reporting. This release allows customers to achieve true hybrid connectivity by connecting on-premises systems to SaaS applications through Azure connectivity.

Starting with this release, BizTalk Server aims for a more open and collaborative story.
