# Prepare Your Computer for Installation
This topic lists the steps to prepare your computer by installing and configuring all software prerequisites, and then creating accounts and setting permissions.

> [!TIP]
> An integration MVP prepared a very detailed step-by-step guide to install the prerequisites, and BizTalk Server:  [BizTalk 2013 Installation and Configuration part 1](https://sandroaspbiztalkblog.wordpress.com/2013/05/05/biztalk-2013-installation-and-configuration-important-considerations-before-set-up-the-server-part-1/).
>
> Some steps are not recommended by Microsoft, such as disabling User Access Control (UAC) or Windows Firewall.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Complete these tasks in the order listed.

##  <a name="BKMK_InstUpdates"></a> Install Windows Updates

- **Windows 7**: Click Start. In the **Search** text box, type **Windows Update**.

- **Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2**: Click the Windows button on the keyboard and type **Windows Update**. From the search results, click **Windows Update**.

  After installing updates, you may need to restart the computer.

##  <a name="BKMK_IIS"></a> Enable Internet Information Services
 Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) provides a Web application infrastructure for many BizTalk Server features, including:

-   HTTP adapter

-   SOAP adapter

-   Windows SharePoint Services adapter

-   Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption

-   BAM Portal

#### Install IIS

For the specific install steps, see:

[Install IIS (Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012)](/iis/get-started/whats-new-in-iis-8/installing-iis-8-on-windows-server-2012)

[Install IIS (Windows 7 and Windows Vista)](/iis/install/installing-iis-7/installing-iis-on-windows-vista-and-windows-7)


When you install IIS, in addition to the default checked options, also check the following:

- **Web Management Tools**: Also check:

    - IIS 6 Management Compatibility:

        - IIS 6 Management Console

        - IIS Metabase and IIS 6 configuration compatibility

    - IIS Management Console

- **World Wide Web Services**: Expand **Security** and also select:

    - Basic Authentication

    - Windows Authentication

Also consider the following:

- **.Net Framework 3.5 Features**: .NET Framework 4.5 and .NET Framework 3.5 can be used to develop .Net applications involving the BizTalk Adapter Pack. Typically, **.NET Framework 4.5 Features** is already installed. If you will use .NET Framework 3.5 to create applications on this computer, then **.Net Framework 3.5 Features** can also be installed.

- **Message Queuing**: If you are using the MSMQ adapter, you can create a local MSMQ store by checking **Message Queuing**.

- **SMTP Server**: If you are using the SMTP adapter, you can create a local SMTP Server by checking **SMTP Server**.

- **Windows Identity Foundation 3.5**: Windows Identity Foundation (WIF) is required by the SharePoint adapter when using the CSOM installation option. [Appendix B: Install the Microsoft SharePoint Adapter](../install-and-config-guides/appendix-b-install-the-microsoft-sharepoint-adapter.md) describes the CSOM installation option for the SharePoint adapter.


##  <a name="BKMK_XLS"></a> Install Microsoft Office Excel

1. Run the Microsoft Office setup.

2. When you reach the **Type of Installation** screen, select **Custom Install**, and then select **Next**.

3. On the **Custom Setup** screen, select **Excel**, and then select **Next**.

4. Select **Install**.

5. In **Setup Completed**, select **Finish**.

   **Additional**

-   BizTalk Server supports only 32-bit version of Microsoft Office.

-   Microsoft Office Excel is required by Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) in BizTalk Server. The BAM Office Excel Workbook defines the business processes you want to monitor. You also use the BAM Excel Workbook to define the way business users see the data collected by BAM.

-   To successfully load BAM.xla into Excel, install **Visual Basic for Applications** under **Office Shared Features**. Otherwise, you may get error “This workbook has lost its VBA project, ActiveX controls and any other programmability-related features.”

##  <a name="BKMK_VS"></a> Install Visual Studio

1. Run the Visual Studio setup as Administrator.

2. Accept the license agreement and click **Next**.

3. In **Optional features to install**, select the options you need and then select **Install**. BizTalk Server does not require any of the optional features.

4. On the **Finish** page, close the window or click **Launch** to open Visual Studio.

   **Additional**

-   If you install Visual Studio before installing BizTalk Server, and then upgrade to Visual Studio Team Explorer, you may need to repair your BizTalk Server installation from the **Control Panel** / **Programs** option.

-   Visual Studio automatically installs Microsoft SQL Server Express; which is not used by BizTalk Server. As a best practice, uninstall Microsoft SQL Server Express.

-   The BizTalk Server development tools are based on Visual Studio. At a minimum, you must install the Microsoft Visual C#® .NET component of Visual Studio before you install the BizTalk Server**Developer Tools and SDK**.

-   Visual Studio is *not* required if you are installing BizTalk Server on a production computer (runtime only), on which no application development or debugging is required.

-   The BizTalk Server runtime requires .NET Framework 4.5. The .NET Framework 3.0 is required if the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) adapter or WCF Interceptor is installed.

##  <a name="BKMK_SQL"></a> Install SQL Server
 Install [SQL Server 2008 R2](/sql/sql-server/sql-server-2008-r2-sp2-release-notes)

 Install [SQL Server 2012](/sql/sql-server/sql-server-2012-release-notes)

 Install [SQL Server 2014](/sql/sql-server/sql-server-2014-release-notes)

 When you install SQL Server, select the following features:

- Database Engine Services

  -   SQL Server Replication

  -   Full-Text Search

- Analysis Services

- Reporting Services

- Shared Features

  -   SQL Server Data Tools (SQL Server 2014 / SQL Server 2012) or Business Intelligence Development Studio (SQL Server 2008 R2)

       [Download SQL Server 2014 Data Tools](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=42313)

  -   Client Tools Connectivity

  -   Integration Services

  -   Management Tools - Basic

      -   Management Tools - Complete

  **Additional**

- BizTalk Server supports all case-sensitive and case-insensitive SQL Server collations except for binary collations. Binary collations are not supported.

- For optimal performance, Microsoft recommends using the Enterprise Edition of SQL Server. 

- Service packs and Windows Updates are supported and should be installed.

- When BizTalk Server and SQL Server are on separate computers, Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MS DTC) handles the transactions between the computers. The SQL Server AlwaysOn feature does not support MSDTC transactions. The SQL Server AlwaysOn feature is not supported.

##  <a name="BKMK_MQSeries"></a> Install MQSeries Prerequisites
 **MQSeries adapter**: Automatically installed with the BizTalk Server installation.

 **MQSeries Client (MQSC) adapter**:

1. Run the Host Integration Server (HIS) installation

2. In component installation, expand **BizTalk Adapters**.

3. Select **BizTalk Adapter for WebSphere MQ (Client-Based)**.

   **Supported IBM WebSphere MQ versions**:

> [!NOTE]
>  If a specific WebSphere MQ version is not listed, like MQ 5.x, then it is not supported with this BizTalk Server version.

 **Additional**

- As a best practice, always install the latest WebSphere MQ fix pack. See [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27006037](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27006037).

- If IBM WebSphere MQ is installed on a non-Windows computer, install the **MQSAgent COM+ application** (MQSConfigWiz.exe) and **MQSeries Server for Windows** on the same computer. If IBM WebSphere MQ is installed on a Windows computer, then the **MQSAgent COM+ application** and **MQSeries Server for Windows** program are not used or needed.

   **MQSConfigWiz.exe** is included in the BizTalk Server installation files.

   **MQSeries Server for Windows** is not a Microsoft program and must be obtained with your IBM WebSphere MQ program.

- [MQSeries Adapter](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/aa547973\(v=BTS.80\).aspx) provides more information on the MQSeries adapter, including configuring the different components. [BizTalk Server: MQSeries and MQSeries Client (MQSC) adapters](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/18316.biztalk-server-mqseries-and-mqseries-client-mqsc-adapters.aspx) provides additional details on the MQSeries and MQSC adapters.

- IBM WebSphere is not a Microsoft product and is not supported by Microsoft. Microsoft makes no guarantees about the suitability of this program. For more information about IBM WebSphere MQ, including download instructions, see www.ibm.com.

##  <a name="BKMK_BAMAlerts"></a> BAM Alerts
 BAM Alerts with SQL Server 2012 and newer versions use Database Mail in SQL Server. BAM Alerts with SQL Server 2008 R2 and older versions use SQL Notification Services. Before installing or configuring BAM Alerts, you must configure the Notification Services or Database Mail in SQL Server.

###  <a name="BKMK_DBMail"></a> BAM Alerts using SQL Server 2012/2014
 Configure [SQL Server Database Mail](/sql/relational-databases/database-mail/database-mail).

 **Additional**

-   Database Mail uses an SMTP server to send the BAM Alerts. SMTP Server can be installed locally on the BizTalk Server or on another IIS server. [Appendix D: Create the SMTP Server](../install-and-config-guides/appendix-d-create-the-smtp-server.md) lists the steps to install and configure a SMTP Server.
