# Hardware and Software Requirements for BizTalk Server 2020

## Hardware requirements

The following table lists the minimum hardware requirements for your BizTalk Server computer. In a production environment, the volume of traffic may require greater hardware requirements for your servers.

- **Computer and processor**: A computer with an Intel Pentium-compatible CPU that is:
  - 1.4 GHz or higher

  Hyper-threading and multi-core processors are supported.

  The 64-bit versions of BizTalk Server require a 64-bit operating system running on an x64-based system. Computers based on CPUs that are compatible with the AMD64 (x86-64) and Extended Memory 64-bit Technology (EM64T) processor architecture are considered x64-based systems.

  BizTalk Server is not supported on Itanium-based systems.

- **Memory**: 4 GB or more
- **Hard disk**: 10 GB of available hard disk space for a complete installation, including the operating system and all prerequisite software. The hard disk must be NTFS formatted.

> [!TIP]
> The hardware requirements listed are the minimum. Every environment is different and there's a very good chance that your environment may need more depending on your throughput requirement and load. See [Recommendations for Installing, Sizing, Deploying, and Maintaining a BizTalk Server Solution](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/666.recommendations-for-installing-sizing-deploying-and-maintaining-a-biztalk-server-solution.aspx). Also refer to Windows System requirements for [Windows Server 2016](/windows-server/get-started/system-requirements) and [Windows Server 2019](/windows-server/get-started-19/sys-reqs-19).

## Software requirements & supported versions

When applying a cumulative update, some of the required software versions may change. To see the software versions that are updated, read the KB article for the cumulative update. For a list of cumulative updates, go to [Service Pack and cumulative update list for BizTalk Server](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/service-pack-and-cumulative-update-list-for-biztalk-server-108e5e94-4558-8b57-d5fb-45984506d56f).
