# Securing Your BizTalk Server Deployment
The topics in this section provide the links about configuring firewall ports, Internet protocol security (IPSec), and secure sockets layer (SSL) security after you have installed and configured BizTalk.

- For more information about how to implement SSL in a Web server, see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=193059](/iis/manage/configuring-security/how-to-set-up-ssl-on-iis).

- For more information about how to enable encryption between SQL Server and its clients such as processing servers and administration clients, see [Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)](/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/transparent-data-encryption).

- For more information about how to configure identity management for your on-premises servers, see [Identity Manager](/microsoft-identity-manager/).

  In addition to the topics in this section, you should review the following information:

- For conceptual information about planning and maintaining a secure deployment, see [Planning for Security](../core/planning-for-security.md).

- For information about configuring access for administrators and system users, see [Managing BizTalk Server Security](../core/managing-biztalk-server-security.md).

- For more information about security features in BizTalk Server, see [Secure and protect your BizTalk messages](../core/secure-and-protect-your-biztalk-messages.md).

- For more information about how to implement secure messages, see [Implementing Message Security](../core/implementing-message-security.md).
