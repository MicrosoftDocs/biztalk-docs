# Hardware and Software Requirements for BizTalk Server 2016

## Hardware requirements

The following table lists the minimum hardware requirements for your BizTalk Server computer. In a production environment, the volume of traffic may require greater hardware requirements for your servers.

| Resource |Minimum Requirement |
| --- | --- |
|Computer and processor | A computer with an Intel Pentium-compatible CPU that is: <ul><li>1 GHz or higher for single processors</li><li>900 MHz or higher for double processors</li><li>700 MHz or higher for quad processors</li></ul> **NOTE**: Hyper-threading and dual-core processors are supported.<br/><br/>The 64-bit versions of BizTalk Server require a 64-bit operating system running on an x64-based system. Computers based on CPUs that are compatible with the AMD64 (x86-64) and Extended Memory 64-bit Technology (EM64T) processor architecture are considered x64-based systems.<br/><br/>BizTalk Server is not supported on Itanium-based systems. |
|Memory | 2 GB or more|
|Hard disk |10 GB of available hard disk space for a complete installation, including the operating system and all prerequisite software. The hard disk must be NTFS formatted.|

> [!TIP]
> The hardware requirements listed are the minimum. Every environment is different and there's a very good chance that your environment may need more.

Only SQL Server 2016 AlwaysOn AG supports MSDTC, which is required by BizTalk. BizTalk Server 2016 CU5 or later is also recommended for SQL AlwaysOn AG <br>- BAM real-time aggregation (RTA) is not supported in SQL Server Standard Edition. To use BAM RTA, install SQL Server Enterprise Edition. <br>- Using SQL Server Express Edition is not recommended. The Express edition doesn't include certain features needed by BizTalk Server. <br>- BizTalk Server supports all case-sensitive and case-insensitive SQL Server collations except for binary collations.

## Service Pack and Cumulative Update Support

All service packs, cumulative updates, security updates, and hotfixes are supported on a BizTalk Server. It is strongly encouraged to install the latest update for Windows, SQL Server, Visual Studio, and any program installed. Service Packs for Microsoft products are supported based on the baseline support for that product. Refer to [Support Lifecycle Index](/lifecycle/) for BizTalk Server, SQL Server, Visual Studio, and other Microsoft programs.
