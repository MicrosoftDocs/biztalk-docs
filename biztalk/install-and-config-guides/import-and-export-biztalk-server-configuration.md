# Import and Export BizTalk Server Configuration
The BizTalk Server Configuration provides a high-level analysis on the configuration state of the features you have installed on the local machine. The tool allows you to configure and unconfigure features, configure security settings, and import and export configurations.  
  
## Prerequisites to use the BizTalk Server configuration  
   
-   The account you are signed in as must be a member of the local administrators group, and have System Administrator rights on SQL Server.  
  
-   The default accounts generated by BizTalk Server and listed in the BizTalk Server Configuration are local groups. In a multiserver environment, replace these local groups with domain groups.  
  
-   The account you are signed in as must be a member of the OLAP Administrators group on the OLAP computer, if configuring.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If you change the group membership of the current signed-in user, and the group is also a member of the domain, be sure sign out, and then sign back in after the changes are finished. If you don't sign out/sign back in, you may be denied access as new group membership is not reflected by the current login.  
  
## Apply the configuration  
  
1.  In the **BizTalk Server Configuration**, click **Apply Configuration**.  
  
2.  On the **Summary** screen, review the configuration, and then click **Next**.  
  
3.  On the **Completion** screen, click **Finish**.  
  
## Import configuration

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you import a configuration file, confirm that the configuration file does not configure a component that has not been installed on the BizTalk Server you are configuring. Attempting to configure a component that does not exist on the BizTalk Server may lead to a deadlock condition. In this situation, unconfigure components that depend on the component that the configuration file is attempting to configure. However, attempting to unconfigure dependent components may require that the missing component be present and configured. To resolve this problem, you must either edit the configuration file to remove references to uninstalled components, or apply the configuration file to a compatible installation of BizTalk Server.  
> 
>  Passwords and Backup file locations are not saved in the configuration file you are importing unless you have manually edited the file. If features are already configured, they are not imported.  
  
  
1.  In the **BizTalk Server Configuration**, click **Import Configuration**.  
  
2.  In the **Open** dialog box, select the configuration file you want to import, and then click **Open**.

4.  On the **Summary** screen, review the configuration, and then click **Next**.  
  
5.  On the **Completion** screen, click **Finish**.
