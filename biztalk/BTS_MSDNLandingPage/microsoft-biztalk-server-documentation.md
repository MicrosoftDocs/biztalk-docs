# Microsoft BizTalk Server Documentation
Microsoft BizTalk Server unites enterprise application integration (EAI) and business-to-business (B2B) integration. Use these to address all of your integration challenges from the enterprise to the Internet.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] provides a powerful web-based development and execution environment that integrates loosely coupled, long-running business processes, both within and between businesses. It handles transactions that run as long as weeks or months, not just minutes or hours. Features include the ability to design and use XLANG schedules, integrate existing applications, define document specifications and specification transformations, and monitor and log run-time activity.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] a standard gateway for sending and receiving documents across the internet, as well as providing a range of services that ensure data integrity, delivery, security, and support for the BizTalk Framework and other key document formats.  
  
## What's changed in your documentation  
As you may know, the core of [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] continues to provide a system built upon [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[btsDotNetFramework](../includes/btsdotnetframework-md.md)], orchestration and business logic, [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerAdminConsoleui](../includes/btsbiztalkserveradminconsoleui-md.md)], adapters, and more. In this aspect, we continue to use the same BizTalk databases, provide guidance on high availability and large messages, show you how to manage and monitor your solutions, and more. This documentation is considered the "core" documentation, and applies to:

* [!INCLUDE[bts2016](../includes/bts2016-md.md)]  
* [!INCLUDE[bts2013r2](../includes/bts2013r2-md.md)]
* [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] 2013

  
 When something has changed, like changes in the SFTP adapter or closer integration with [!INCLUDE[winazure](../includes/winazure-md.md)], we'll tell you. For example, we state something like *starting with [!INCLUDE[bts2016](../includes/bts2016-md.md)]...*. We also created a separate **BizTalk Technical Guides** section, which includes white papers on [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], and integration with [!INCLUDE[winazure](../includes/winazure-md.md)]. We hope these changes make it easier to navigate.  
  
 We continue to include the main documentation links for [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] 2010 and earlier versions.
