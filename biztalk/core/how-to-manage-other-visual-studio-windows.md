# How to Manage Other Visual Studio Windows
Certain operations in BizTalk Editor use other Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] windows, namely the Output window and the Task List window. These windows are used to display output from operations, such as generating sample instance messages and validating schemas and instances. This topic provides step-by-step instructions about managing these windows.  
  
### To open the Output window  
  
- In [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)], click on the **View** menu, and then click **Output**.  
  
  > [!NOTE]
  >  If you want to view the file corresponding to a line in the Output window, double-click that line.  
  
### To open the Task List window  
  
- In [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)], click on the **View** menu, and then click **Task List**.  
  
  > [!NOTE]
  >  If you want to view the node in a BizTalk schema that corresponds to a task line in the Task List window, double-click that task line.  
  
  By default, the Output window and the Task List window share the same section of the [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] shell. If both windows are open at the same time, they are displayed with named tabs that allow you to switch back and forth between them.
