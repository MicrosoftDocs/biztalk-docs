# Structure of a Binding File
The structure of binding files exported from the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console adheres to a schema that is used to describe all binding files.  
  
 This topic should be used as a reference when manually modifying binding files that were exported with the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console.
