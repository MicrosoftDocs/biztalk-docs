# Publish BizTalk SOAP endpoints in API Management

Expose your BizTalk SOAP endpoints as services within Azure API Management. 

**Starting with [!INCLUDE[bts2016_md](../includes/bts2016-md.md)] Feature Pack 1**, you can expose a SOAP endpoint through API Management from BizTalk. You can do this using  API Management in the Azure portal. 

**Starting with [!INCLUDE[bts2016_md](../includes/bts2016-md.md)] Feature Pack 2**, you can expose a WCF-BasicHTTP receive location as an endpoint within Azure API Management using BizTalk Administration. 

> [!TIP]
> [What is API Management?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-key-concepts) is a great resource to understand and learn more about this Azure service.

## Prerequisites
* Configure and set up [Azure API Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-get-started)
* Create a [virtual network](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/api-management-using-with-vnet) between your BizTalk computer and the API Management instance
* Install [Feature Pack 2](https://aka.ms/bts2016fp2) on the BizTalk Server

## Create using API Management in Azure portal 
1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open up your API management, and select **APIs**:

	![select API for BizTalk](../core/media/select-api-for-biztalk.png)
	
2. Select **WSDL**:

	![select wsdl biztalk api](../core/media/select-wsdl-biztalk-api.png)
	
3. Configure your WSDL properties: 

    1. **WSDL specification** : Enter the full URI to your BizTalk SOAP endpoint. For example, enter something like `http://10.0.31.22/RestEndPoint/OrderIncome.svc?wsdl` or `http://biztalkfp1.westus.cloudapp.azure.com/RestEndPoint/OrderIncome.svc?wsdl`.  

    2. **SOAP pass-through** or **SOAP to REST** : Select your preference: 
        * **SOAP to REST**: Create REST-based HTTP APIs from an existing SOAP-based web service
        * **SOAP pass-through**: Acts as a proxy for the SOAP API 

    3. Enter your preferred **Display Name**, **Name**, **Description**, **API Url suffix**, **Products**, and **Version**.

    When finished, your WSDL configuration looks something like the following: 

	![create API from WSDL BizTalk](../core/media/create-api-from-wsdl-biztalk.png)

4. Select **Create**.

## Create using the BizTalk Administration

> [!NOTE] 
> This feature is supported with WCF-BasicHTTP receive locations. 

1. In the BizTalk Administration Console, right-click your WCF-BasicHTTP receive location, and select **Publish to API Management**:  

    ![publish menu option](../core/media/publish-to-api-management-option.png)
 
2. Configure your API management properties: 

    1. **Sign-in** to your Azure subscription, select the **Subscription** and **Resource Group** that has your API management service, and then select your service.

    2. The **WSDL specification link** is automatically populated with your WSDL file. Replace **localhost** with the DNS name or IP address of the BizTalk Server. 

    3. Select **SOAP pass-through** or **SOAP to REST**:  
        * **SOAP to REST**: Create REST-based HTTP APIs from an existing SOAP-based web services
        * **SOAP pass-through**: Acts as a proxy for the SOAP API 

        The API can be published both ways by changing the **API URL suffix**, and then publishing again using a different API type.

    4. The **API name** is automatically populated with the receive location name.

    5. Select an **API URL suffix** that is to be used by consumers of the API. 

    When finished, your properties look similar to the following:  
    ![publish to API window](../core/media/api-management-publish-window.png)


3. Select **Publish**. When successful, the receive location is displayed as a service in API Management in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). 

## Do more
Azure API Management is a powerful service that is used by a lot of Azure services, including Logic Apps. API Management includes many features, including rate limits and quotas, who has access to your APIs, caching, and more. See [What is API Management?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-key-concepts) to get started.
