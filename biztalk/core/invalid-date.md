## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that the receive pipeline could not process the incoming interchange or the send pipeline could not process the outgoing interchange because a date value in a data element did not conform to the data type specified by the EDI schema or the date value in the GS04 field header in an X12 interchange did not conform to the service schema (X12ServiceSchema in BaseArtifacts.dll). For X12, the service schema defines a date in the GS04 field as of the X12_DT data type and between six and eight characters in length.  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, make sure that the time value in a data element conforms to the data type specified by the EDI schema or the date value in the GS04 header of an X12 interchange conforms to the service schema, and then have the interchange resent.
