# Complex Global Type Derivation
There are two types of inheritance in XSD: extension and restriction. BizTalk Editor provides access to this XSD functionality by using the following two **Record** node properties:  
  
-   **Base Data Type**. This property provides the list of all global complex types and simple types available for use as a base data type. The complex global types can be in the same schema or in any imported schema.  
  
-   **Derived By**. This property is used to choose between deriving by extension or by restriction. This property is automatically set to **Extension** when you set the **Base Data Type** property to any type in the list. If you set this property to **(Default)**, any type in the **Base Data Type** property is removed, disabling inheritance for the node.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The **Content Type** property is also set automatically to **ComplexContent** when derivation by extension or restriction is being used.  
  
 This section explains complex type derivation by using the extension and restriction mechanisms in greater detail.
