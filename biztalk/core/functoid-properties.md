# Functoid Properties

## Overview
Functoids have properties that are available for examination and modification in the [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] Properties window. Several functoid properties are only available for particular functoids and are disabled for other functoids. One functoid property, **Input Parameters**, is especially important to almost all functoids, and will probably be the most frequently used. For more information about the **Input Parameters** property, see [Functoid Input Parameters](../core/functoid-input-parameters.md).  
  
 All functoid properties are categorized as **General** properties. For a complete listing of functoid properties, see the **General Functoid Properties** [!INCLUDE[ui-guidance-developers-reference](../includes/ui-guidance-developers-reference.md)].
