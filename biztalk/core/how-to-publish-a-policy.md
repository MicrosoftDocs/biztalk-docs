# How to Publish a Policy
This topic describes how to use the BizTalk Server Administration console to publish a policy in a BizTalk group. Publishing a policy makes it available to add to a BizTalk application, as described in [How to Add a Policy to an Application](../core/how-to-add-a-policy-to-an-application.md).  
  
 Before you can publish a policy, it must exist in the Rule Engine database for the BizTalk group. There are three ways to import a policy into the Rule Engine database:  
  
-   You can import an application that contains a policy. When you do this, the policy is automatically imported into the Rule Engine database.  
  
-   You can explicitly import a policy into the Rule Engine database by using the administration console or BTSTask, as described in [How to Import a Policy](../core/how-to-import-a-policy.md).  
  
-   You can add a policy to the Rule Engine database by using the Rule Engine Deployment Wizard, as described in [How to Deploy and Undeploy Policies and Vocabularies](../core/how-to-deploy-and-undeploy-policies-and-vocabularies.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  While a published policy can be overwritten by another policy that you import, should you specify this option, a published vocabulary can never be overwritten. To update a published vocabulary, you must remove it from the Rule Engine database and then import the new version.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform the procedure in this topic, you must be logged on with an account that is a member of the BizTalk Server Administrators group. For more detailed information on permissions, see [Permissions Required for Deploying and Managing a BizTalk Application](../core/permissions-required-for-deploying-and-managing-a-biztalk-application.md).  
  
### To publish a policy  
  
1.  Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerStartMenuItemui](../includes/btsbiztalkserverstartmenuitemui-md.md)], and then click **BizTalk Server Administration**.  
  
2.  In the console tree, expand [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerAdminConsoleui](../includes/btsbiztalkserveradminconsoleui-md.md)], expand the BizTalk group containing the policy to publish, expand **Applications**, and then expand **\<All Artifacts\>**.  
  
3.  Click **Policies**, right-click the policy, and then click **Publish**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  In order to publish a policy, any assemblies that are referenced by the policy must be installed in the Global Assembly Cache (GAC) of the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] computer before you open **BizTalk Server Administration**. When **BizTalk Server Administration** is opened, it maintains a cache of the assemblies that are installed into the GAC. This cache is not updated until **BizTalk Server Administration** is closed and reopened. If you attempt to publish a policy and publication fails because a referenced assembly is not installed in the GAC you must close **BizTalk Server Administration**, install the referenced assembly into the GAC, open **BizTalk Server Administration**, and then publish the policy.
