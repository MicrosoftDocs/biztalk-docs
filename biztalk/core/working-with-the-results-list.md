# Working with the Results List
When you run a query in the Group Hub page, it generates a **Query results** list containing the search results, such as relevant messages, pipelines, and assemblies.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  To sort the Results list, click any column heading. Each time you click, it will switch between ascending or descending alphabetical or numerical display of the column values.
