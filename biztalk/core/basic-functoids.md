# Basic Functoids
Any functoid not in the **Advanced** category is considered a basic functoid. Basic functoids are generally easy to use, having few and, often, straightforward input parameters to be configured. This section provides conceptual information about the basic functoids, organized by category.  
  
 For step-by-step instructions about how to add a basic functoid to a BizTalk map, see [How to Add Basic Functoids to a Map](../core/how-to-add-basic-functoids-to-a-map.md).  
  
 For reference information about all functoids, including basic functoids, see the **Functoid Reference** [!INCLUDE[ui-guidance-developers-reference](../includes/ui-guidance-developers-reference.md)].
