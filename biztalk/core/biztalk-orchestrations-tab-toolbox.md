# BizTalk Orchestrations Tab, Toolbox
When you open a project that uses Orchestration Designer (a [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] orchestration), the Toolbox also displays the **BizTalk Orchestrations** tab. The tools on this tab, called *shapes*, are visible and available for use when the **BizTalk Orchestrations** tab is expanded.  
  
 To use an orchestration on the BizTalk **Orchestrations** tab, drag it onto the design surface of the active BizTalk orchestration. You can drag **Port** shapes and **Role Link** shapes onto either the left Port Surface or the right Port Surface. Onto the central Process Area you can drag all other shapesâ€”shapes that describe the process flow of the orchestration.  
  
 For more information about using the Toolbox and **Toolbox** tabs, see "Managing Tabs and Items in the Toolbox" in the [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] documentation.
