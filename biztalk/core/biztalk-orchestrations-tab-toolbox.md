# BizTalk Orchestrations Tab, Toolbox
When you open a project that uses Orchestration Designer (a [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] orchestration), the Toolbox also displays the **BizTalk Orchestrations** tab. The tools on this tab, called *shapes*, are visible and available for use when the **BizTalk Orchestrations** tab is expanded.  
  
 To use an orchestration on the BizTalk **Orchestrations** tab, drag it onto the design surface of the active BizTalk orchestration. You can drag **Port** shapes and **Role Link** shapes onto either the left Port Surface or the right Port Surface. Onto the central Process Area you can drag all other shapes—shapes that describe the process flow of the orchestration.  
  
 For more information about using the Toolbox and **Toolbox** tabs, see "Managing Tabs and Items in the Toolbox" in the [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] documentation.
