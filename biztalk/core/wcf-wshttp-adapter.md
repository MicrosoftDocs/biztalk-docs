# WCF-WSHttp Adapter
[!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../includes/btsconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] uses the WCF-WSHttp adapter when receiving and sending WCF service requests through the [WSHttpBinding](/dotnet/api/system.servicemodel.wshttpbinding). The WCF-WSHttp adapter enables you to publish orchestrations and schemas as WCF services and to consume external WCF services with the **WSHttpBinding**.
