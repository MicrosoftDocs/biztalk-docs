# Appendix C: Using Component Interfaces
The topics in this section describe how to create new component interfaces—and how to modify existing component interfaces—for use with Microsoft BizTalk Adapter for PeopleSoft Enterprise. They also describe how to apply security to those component interfaces and how to test them.  
  
 You can do the following:  
  
- Use component interfaces supplied by PeopleSoft with your application.  
  
   Component interfaces also are known as Enterprise Integration Points (EIP).  
  
- Modify an existing component interface.  
  
- Create a new component interface.  
  
  Before using your component interface, you must apply and test security.
