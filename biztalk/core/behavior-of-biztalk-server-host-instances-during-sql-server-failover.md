# Behavior of BizTalk Server Host Instances during SQL Server Failover
[!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] databases housed on a clustered instance of Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] are temporarily unavailable if the clustered instance of [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] experiences a failover. This section documents the behavior of the host instances associated with [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] when the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] databases are unavailable.  
  
## Behavior of In-Process Host Instances during SQL Server Failover  
 If the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] databases are unavailable, then an in-process instance of a [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] host will be recycled until the connection to the [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] is restored. Once the connection to the [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] databases is restored, document processing resumes normally.  
  
## Behavior of Isolated Host Instances During SQL Server Failover  
 If the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] databases are unavailable, then an isolated instance of a [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] host will pause and an error similar to the following will be generated in the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Application log:  
  
```  
All receive locations are being temporarily disabled because either   
the MessageBox or Configuration database is not available.   
When these databases become available, the receive locations will be automatically enabled.  
```  
  
 Once the connection to the [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] databases is restored an informational message similar to the following is written to the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Application log and document processing resumes normally:  
  
```  
All receive locations are being enabled because both the MessageBox and Configuration databases are back online.  
```
