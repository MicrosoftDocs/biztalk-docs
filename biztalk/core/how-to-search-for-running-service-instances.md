# How to Search for Running Service Instances
You can use the **Query** tab in the BizTalk Server Administration Console to search for a specific dehydrated, active, in breakpoint, scheduled, and retrying service instance.  

## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure, you must be logged on as a member of the BizTalk Server Operators group.  

### To search for running service instances  

1. Click **Start**, click **Programs**, click [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerStartMenuItemui](../includes/btsbiztalkserverstartmenuitemui-md.md)], and then click **BizTalk Server Administration**.  

2. In the console tree, expand [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerAdminConsoleui](../includes/btsbiztalkserveradminconsoleui-md.md)], and then click the BizTalk group.  

3. In the details pane, click the **New Query** tab.  

4. In the **Query Expression** group, in the **Value** column, select **Running Service Instances** from the drop-down list box.  

5. In the **Field Name** column, in the empty drop-down list box next to the asterisk (`\`), select one or more of the following:  


   |          Item          |                                                             Description                                                             |

   |  **Application Name**  |                                                   The BizTalk Server application.                                                   |
   |   **Creation Time**    |                             Find running service instances created before or after the specified date.                              |
   |  **Group Results By**  |  You can group results by application, host name, pending operation type, service class, service instance status, or service name.  |
   |     **Host Name**      |                                                    The name of the BizTalk Host.                                                    |
   |  **Instance Status**   |             You can search for active instances, dehydrated instances, ready to run instances, and scheduled instances.             |

   | **Pending Operations** |                      You can search for running service instances that are pending suspension or termination.                       |
   |   **Service Class**    | You can search for isolated adapters; messaging; messaging, and isolated adapters; MSMQT; Orchestration; or Routing Failure Report. |

   |  **Service Type ID**   |                                        You can group or filter messages by service type ID.                                         |
