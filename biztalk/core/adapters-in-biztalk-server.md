# Adapters in BizTalk Server
One of the primary design goals of [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] is to facilitate the exchange of business documents between trading partners. To help meet this goal, [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] includes several adapters that provide connectivity between BizTalk Server and trading partners using commonly recognized data protocols and document formats. This topic discusses what an adapter is and why you use an adapter.

## What Is an Adapter?
 An adapter is a software component that enables you to easily send messages out of or receive messages into BizTalk Server with a delivery mechanism that conforms to a commonly recognized standard, such as SMTP, POP3, FTP, or Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ). As Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] has evolved, the need for adapters that quickly enable connectivity with commonly used applications and technologies has increased.

 [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] includes the following adapters, which are referred to as the "native" or "integrated" adapters: FILE, FTP, HTTP, MQSeries, MSMQ, POP3, SMTP, SOAP, Windows Sharepoint Services, and the seven WCF adapters (WCF-WSHttp, WCF-BasicHttp, WCF-NetTcp, WCF-NetMsmq, WCF-NetNamedPipe, WCF-Custom, and WCF-CustomIsolated). Native adapters are installed with [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)]. You can also create custom adapters for your specific solutions by using the BizTalk Adapter Framework.

 Each of the native adapters is associated with a receive location designed to listen for messages from a certain transport at a certain address. After the message is received by the receive location, it is passed to the adapter. The adapter attaches the data stream to the message (typically in the body part of the message), adds any metadata pertaining to the endpoint that the data was received from, and then submits that message into the BizTalk Messaging Engine.

 By default, when you run the BizTalk Configuration Wizard, the wizard installs the native adapters and creates an adapter handler with a default configuration for each one.

 Using the BizTalk Server Administration console, you can modify the default configuration for the adapter handlers as well as add, remove, and modify send ports and receive locations for the adapters. For more information about these processes, see the appropriate topics in See Also.

## Why Use an Adapter?
 Using adapters greatly simplifies the transfer of messages into or out of BizTalk Server. If your existing infrastructure uses any of the transports for which there is a corresponding BizTalk adapter, then the process of sending messages to or receiving messages from BizTalk Server is as simple as configuring the appropriate adapter to send or receive messages with the corresponding transport mechanism.

## Functionality support in built-in adapters
 The following table lists the primary benefit of each native adapter and whether the adapter provides the following features:

-   **Transaction support** : The ability to send and receive documents under the context of a distributed transaction coordinator (DTC) transaction. This functionality is required for maintaining ordered message delivery and to guarantee that documents are not duplicated or lost.

-   **Two-way communication support (Request/Response or Solicit/Response)** : The ability to send a document and process a response message from the destination or to receive a document and send a response message to the source.

-   **In-order receive support** : The ability to publish received documents to the BizTalk MessageBox database in the exact order that the documents were received.

-   **SSO enabled** : The ability to use SSO authentication when sending or receiving documents with the adapter.

-   **Hosting process** : The process in which the adapter executes. *BizTalk IP* executes within the BTSNTSvc.exe process, while *IIS OOP* run outside the BizTalk Server process in the Internet Information Server (IIS) process.
