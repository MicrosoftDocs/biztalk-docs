# How to Validate Schemas in Visual Studio
After you have constructed a schema, you can check your work by validating the schema itself in isolation.  
  
 This topic provides step-by-step instructions for this validation task.  
  
### To validate a schema in isolation  
  
1.  In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the schema that you want to validate, and then click **Validate Schema**.  
  
2.  In the Output window, view the results. Success and error messages are displayed in this window.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If the Output window did not open and display information about whether the schema validation succeeded or failed, you can open it manually. For more information about managing this window, see [Managing Other Visual Studio Windows](../core/how-to-manage-other-visual-studio-windows.md).
