# Manage BizTalk Server Performance Settings
  
 The [!INCLUDE[btsSettingsDashboard](../includes/btssettingsdashboard-md.md)] in BizTalk Server collates the performance settings, and provides a central console to manage these settings. This helps to:  
  
-   Improve the discoverability of the properties that can be set
  
-   Reduce the time-to-solution because all settings are now accessible in a single place and can be exported/imported easily
  
-   Offers a holistic view of level of performance tuning done on a given BizTalk deployment
  
## Why use it?  
 The [!INCLUDE[btsSettingsDashboard](../includes/btssettingsdashboard-md.md)] is targeted towards IT administrators who need to extensively tweak [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] settings for performance optimization.  
  
 You can use the [!INCLUDE[btsSettingsDashboard](../includes/btssettingsdashboard-md.md)] to modify settings for the BizTalk Group, and all the BizTalk Hosts and BizTalk Host Instances in that Group.  
  
 To know more about the group, host, and host instance settings, see [How to Modify Group Settings](../core/how-to-modify-group-settings.md), [How to Modify Host Settings](../core/how-to-modify-host-settings.md), and [How to Modify Host Instance Settings](../core/how-to-modify-host-instance-settings.md).  
  
## Prerequisites 
 You can launch the [!INCLUDE[btsSettingsDashboard](../includes/btssettingsdashboard-md.md)] from the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console. For information on how to manage [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] performance settings using the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console, see [Using the BizTalk Server Administration Console](../core/using-the-biztalk-server-administration-console.md).  
  
## Where Do I Start?  
 You can access the [!INCLUDE[btsSettingsDashboard](../includes/btssettingsdashboard-md.md)] in any of the following ways:  
  
- Start the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console, right-click **BizTalk Group** in the console tree, and then select **Settings**.  
  
- Right click any host under the **Platform Settings** node in MMC and click on **Settings**. This launches [!INCLUDE[btsSettingsDashboard](../includes/btssettingsdashboard-md.md)] and you can modify the settings related to that host.  
  
- Right click any host instance under the **Platform Settings** node in MMC and click on **Settings**. This launches [!INCLUDE[btsSettingsDashboard](../includes/btssettingsdashboard-md.md)] and you can modify the settings related to that host instance.  
  
## Export and import settings  
 The [!INCLUDE[btsSettingsDashboard](../includes/btssettingsdashboard-md.md)] can be used to export settings from a [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] environment and import it into another [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] environment, thereby reducing the overall time-to-solution. This is especially useful in scenarios where the administrators try to tune [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] performance in a test environment, and upon achieving the desired results, they can import the settings into a production environment.  
  
 For information about how to import/export using the [!INCLUDE[btsSettingsDashboard](../includes/btssettingsdashboard-md.md)] user interface, see [Import or export BizTalk Settings Using Settings Dashboard](how-to-import-biztalk-settings-using-settings-dashboard.md).
  
## Scripting support
 The [!INCLUDE[btsSettingsDashboard](../includes/btssettingsdashboard-md.md)] not only provides a central user interface to manage BizTalk settings but also ensures that all settings and the import/export tasks are accessible via APIs and command-line options. This enables BizTalk Server administrators to automate tasks related to BizTalk Server settings. As part of the scripting support:  
  
- All group settings can be accessed and modified via the WMI Class: `MSBTS_GroupSetting`  
  
- All host settings can be accessed and modified via the WMI Class: `MSBTS_HostSetting`  
  
- All host instance settings can be accessed and modified via the WMI Class: `MSBTS_HostInstanceSetting`  
  
- Import and export operations can be accessed through **BTSTask.exe** commands: `ExportSettings` and `ImportSettings`  
  
  For details about how to import/export using the BTSTask.exe command-line utility, see [Import or export BizTalk Settings Using BTSTask](how-to-import-biztalk-settings-using-btstask.md).
