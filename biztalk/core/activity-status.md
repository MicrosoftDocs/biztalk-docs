# Activity Status
The Activity Status area of the results details allows you to view all of the details for the results item on a single page.  
  
 The activity status area contains two subareas; milestones and data.  
  
## Milestones  
 The Milestones area displays all the milestones defined for the selected activity. The milestones data displays the date and time that the milestone was reached. Some milestones are mutually exclusive; such as order approved and denied milestones. In the case of mutually exclusive milestones, one will show the date and time data for the milestone and the other will be blank, indicating that there is no data for that milestone.  
  
## Data  
 The Data area displays all the data items defined for the activity. The data items are displayed in alphabetical order.
