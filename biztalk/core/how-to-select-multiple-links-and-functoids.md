# How to Select Multiple Links and Functoids
When you want to perform a similar operation on a group of functoids and/or links in a map, you can select that group of functoids and/or links all at the same time. This topic provides information about how to perform this operation.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 These instructions require that BizTalk Mapper is running.  
  
## Why do you need to bulk-select links/functoids?  
 You can bulk-select links and/or functoids to do any of the following:  
  
-   Copy/cut and paste the selection in the same grid page or another grid page in the same map.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  For information on how to copy, cut, and paste links and functoids, see [How to Copy, Cut, and Paste Links and Functoids](../core/how-to-copy-cut-and-paste-links-and-functoids.md).  
  
-   Move the selection between grid pages  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  For information on how to move a relationship from one grid page to another, see [How to Move a Relationship Between Grid Pages](../core/how-to-move-a-relationship-between-grid-pages.md).  
  
-   Edit the common properties of functoids and links in the selection  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  For information on how to set comments and labels for functoids and links, see [How to Label a Link](../core/how-to-label-a-link.md) or [How to Label and Comment a Functoid](../core/how-to-label-and-comment-a-functoid.md).
