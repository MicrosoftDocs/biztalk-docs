2.  In the expanded adapter list, click **POP3**, in the right pane, right-click the receive handler that you want to configure, and then click **Properties**.  
  
3.  In the **Adapter Handler Properties** dialog box, on the **General** tab, in the **Host Name** list, select the host with which the receive handler will be associated.
