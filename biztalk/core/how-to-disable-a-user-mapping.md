# How to Disable a User Mapping
You can disable a user mapping when you want to turn off all operations associated with a given mapping. You must disable a user mapping before you can remove it.  
  
 When you disable a user mapping, it will appear as (D) *\<domain\>\\<username\>* when you list the user mappings.  
  
### To disable a user mapping using the administration utility  
  
1.  On the **Start** menu, click **Run**, and then type **cmd**.  
  
2.  At the command line, go to the Enterprise Single Sign-On installation directory. The default installation directory is *\<drive\>*:\Program Files\Common Files\Enterprise Single Sign-On.  
  
3.  Type **ssomanage –disablemapping *\<domain\>*\\*\<username\> \<application name\>***, where *\<domain\>* is the Windows domain for the user account, and *\<username\>* is the Windows user name for which you want to disable the credentials, and *\<application name\>* is the name of the affiliate application you want to remove the user mapping for.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  On a system that supports User Account Control (UAC), you may need to run the tool with Administrative privileges.  
  
### To disable a user mapping using the client utility  
  
1.  On the **Start** menu, click **Run**, and then type **cmd**.  
  
2.  At the command line, go to the Enterprise Single Sign-On installation directory. The default installation directory is *\<drive\>*:\Program Files\Common Files\Enterprise Single Sign-On.  
  
3.  Type **ssoclient –disablemapping *\<application name\>***, where *\<application name\>* is the name of the affiliate application you want to remove the user mapping for.
