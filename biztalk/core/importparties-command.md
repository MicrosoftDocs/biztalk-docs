# ImportParties Command
Imports the business-to-business parties and agreements from a source XML binding
  file in the configuration database, without importing any of the application
  artifacts. For more information, see **Remarks** in this topic.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This command is new starting with **[!INCLUDE[bts2016_md](../includes/bts2016-md.md)]**, and any newer versions.
> 
> [!NOTE]
>  Binding files generated in [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] do not have an application specified. They are imported into the default application.
