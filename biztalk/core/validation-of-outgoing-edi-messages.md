# Validation of Outgoing EDI Messages
When the EDI send pipeline processes a message to be sent, it performs a series of validations on the envelope and message data. Some of these processes are always performed; some are performed only if you enable them. These validations include the following:  
  
-   Schema validation of the transaction-set data elements against the message schema. This is always performed.  
  
-   Cross-field validation on transaction set data elements (X12-encoded messages only). This is performed if it is enabled in the message schema.  
  
-   EDI validation performed on transaction-set data elements. This is performed if enabled in agreement properties.  
  
-   Extended validation performed on transaction-set data elements. This is performed if enabled in agreement properties.  
  
-   Validation of the transaction sets within a single group based on the transaction set â€“ group mapping, according to X12 standards. This is performed only when the **Inbound batch processing option** property is set to **Preserve Interchange - suspend Interchange on Error** or **Preserve Interchange - suspend Transaction Sets on Error**.
