# Developing Custom Adapters
To exchange messages with external systems, applications, and entities, [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] uses the concept of an adapter. Adapters are COM or [!INCLUDE[btsDotNetFramework](../includes/btsdotnetframework-md.md)] components that transfer messages to and from business end. points (such as file systems, databases, and custom business applications) by using various communication protocols. [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] provides native adapters that support various protocols. These include:

- A File adapter that supports sending and receiving messages from a File location

- Adapters for EDI, FTP, HTTP, MSMQ, SMTP, POP3, and SOAP protocols

- An adapter for [!INCLUDE[btsWinSharePointSvcsNoVersion](../includes/btswinsharepointsvcsnoversion-md.md)]

  In some cases [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] may need to transport messages to a specific custom application or use a protocol for which a native adapter does not exist. Third-party companies have written adapters to support additional protocols. You may want to determine if there is an adapter for your protocol before deciding to write a custom adapter. For a list of adapters and associated vendors see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=47140](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=47140). If you are unable to locate an adapter to support your communication requirements, you can develop your own custom adapter.

  Writing a custom adapter can be a challenging exercise. To simplify this process Microsoft has developed a foundation called the Adapter Framework. You can use this framework as a basis for your development along with sample adapter source code in the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] SDK.

  The topics in this section present custom adapter development tips and recommendations.
