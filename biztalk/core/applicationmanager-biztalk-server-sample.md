# ApplicationManager (BizTalk Server Sample)
The ApplicationManager sample demonstrates how to start or stop a  BizTalk application by using the administration objects.  
  
## Prerequisites  
  
-   You must have [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] administrative privileges to use the administrative objects in this sample.  
  
-   The Windows PowerShell script requires the Windows PowerShell execution policy to allow script execution. For more information see: [Examining the Execution Policy](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=128930).  
  
## What This Sample Does  
 This sample demonstrates using the **BtsCatalogExplorer** and **Application** classes from the **Microsoft.BizTalk.ExplorerOM** namespace to start and stop a deployed  BizTalk application. The sample is written in Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsVCSharp](../includes/btsvcsharp-md.md)]. A Windows PowerShell example script is also included in this topic. The sample demonstrates the following operations:  
  
-   Connecting to the BizTalk Management database by using the **BtsCatalogExplorer** class.  
  
-   Finding an application instance from  **BtsCatalogExplorer** based on application name.  
  
-   Submitting a start or stop command for the application.  
  
## Where To Find This Sample  
 The sample is located in the following SDK location:  
  
 \<*Samples Path*\>\Admin\ExplorerOM\ApplicationManager  
  
 The following table shows the files in this sample and describes their purpose.  
  
|File(s)|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|Program.cs|[!INCLUDE[btsVCSharp](../includes/btsvcsharp-md.md)] source file for operations demonstrated in this sample.|  
|ApplicationManager.sln,ApplicationManager.csproj,ApplicationManager.suo|Solution and project files for the sample.|  
  
## Building and Running This Sample  
  
#### To build this sample  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)], open the solution file ApplicationManager.sln.  
  
2.  On the **Build** menu, click **Build Solution**.  
  
#### To run this sample  
  
1.  Open a command window and navigate to the following folder:  
  
     \<*Samples Path*\>\Admin\ExplorerOM\ApplicationManager\bin\Debug  
  
2.  Run the file ApplicationManager.exe providing the following two ordered command-line arguments:  
  
    -   **\<start&#124;stop\>** First argument is the operation to be performed on the deployed application.  
  
    -   **\<ApplicationName\>** Second argument is the name of the deployed application.  
  
     For example:  
  
    ```  
    ApplicationManager.exe stop MyBizTalkApp  
    ```  
  
     Running the sample with insufficient command-line parameters displays the usage syntax. For example:  
  
    ```  
    Usage:  
  
    ApplicationManager <start|stop> <Application Name>  
  
     Where:  
      <Application Name> = The name of the application that needs to be changed  
  
    Example: ApplicationManager start Application1  
    ```  
  
## Windows PowerShell Script Example  
 The following Windows PowerShell script fragment can be used to demonstrate the same features of the **ExplorerOM** classes:  
  
```  
#=== Make sure the ExplorerOM assembly is loaded ===#  
  
[void] [System.reflection.Assembly]::LoadWithPartialName("Microsoft.BizTalk.ExplorerOM")  
  
#=== Connect the BizTalk Management database ===#  
  
$Catalog = New-Object Microsoft.BizTalk.ExplorerOM.BtsCatalogExplorer  
$Catalog.ConnectionString = "SERVER=.;DATABASE=BizTalkMgmtDb;Integrated Security=SSPI"  
  
#=== Loop through applications in the catalog trying to find a name match ===#  
  
foreach($app in $Catalog.Applications)  
{  
    if ($($app.Name) -ieq $args[1])  
    {  
  
        #=== The first command-line argument should be "start" or "stop" ===#  
  
        if ($args[0] -ieq "start")  
        {  
            Write-Host `r`nIssuing start command to $app.Name...`r`n  
            $app.Start([Microsoft.BizTalk.ExplorerOM.ApplicationStartOption] "StartAll")  
            $Catalog.SaveChanges()  
        }  
  
        if ($args[0] -ieq "stop")  
        {  
            Write-Host `r`nIssuing stop command to $app.Name...`r`n  
            $app.Stop([Microsoft.BizTalk.ExplorerOM.ApplicationStopOption] "StopAll")  
            $Catalog.SaveChanges()  
        }  
  
    }  
}  
```  
  
 The script expects the same command-line arguments as the [!INCLUDE[btsVCSharp](../includes/btsvcsharp-md.md)] sample. Here is an example of running the Windows PowerShell script to start a deployed BizTalk application:  
  
```  
PS C:\> .\ApplicationManager.ps1 start MyBizTalkApp  
  
Issuing start command to MyBizTalkApp ...  
```
