# Flat File Assembler Pipeline Component
A Flat File Assembler combines individual documents into a batch and optionally adds a header or trailer (or both) to it. For more information about flat files, see [Flat File Messages with Delimited Records](../core/flat-file-messages-with-delimited-records.md). Also see [Flat File Messages with Positional Records](../core/flat-file-messages-with-positional-records.md).  
  
 The Flat File Assembler pipeline component does not validate the incoming XML message. To ensure XML validation, include the XML Validator component in the Pre-Assemble stage of the send pipeline.  
  
 The Flat File Assembler pipeline component only supports conversions supported by the Microsoft .NET Framework. Any additional conversion can be done by writing to a custom text writer.  
  
 For information about configuring the Flat File Assembler pipeline component, see [How to Configure the Flat File Assembler Pipeline Component](../core/how-to-configure-the-flat-file-assembler-pipeline-component.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  In [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], you cannot assemble messages into one interchange.
