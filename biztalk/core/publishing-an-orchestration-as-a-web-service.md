# Publishing an Orchestration as a Web Service
You use the BizTalk Web Services Publishing Wizard to publish an orchestration as a Web service. The wizard creates a Web service based on an orchestration in a BizTalk assembly. Using the wizard, you select orchestrations and receive ports to publish Web services. You can define target namespaces, SOAP header requirements, and locations for the Web service project the wizard generates.  
  
 Before you run the wizard, you must compile your BizTalk assemblies that contain the orchestrations and schemas that you intend to publish as a Web service.  
  
 Prior to running the BizTalk Web Services Publishing Wizard, you must enable Web services. For more information about enabling Web services for your system, see [Enabling Web Services](../core/enabling-web-services.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You must install [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] before you can publish an orchestration as a Web service. You don't need to install Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)].
