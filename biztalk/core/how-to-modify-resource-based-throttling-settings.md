# How to Modify Resource Based Throttling Settings
Using the Settings Dashboard, you can modify the resource based throttling configuration settings of a given host, across the BizTalk Group. These settings apply to all host instances assigned to the given host. This topic provides the step-by-step procedure to modify these settings.  

 To manage the usage of system resources (such as threads, memory, and database size) by a host instance process, [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] utilizes an adjustable throttling mechanism that governs the flow and processing of messages through a host instance. The [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] host throttling mechanism helps to ensure that the system operates at an optimal and sustainable level by:  

-   Moderating the workload of the host instance.  

-   Preventing the resource contention that can lower the overall performance of the host instance process or other system processes.  

-   Detecting when the available resources are being underutilized.  

## Prerequisites  
 To perform this operation, you must be logged on as a member of the BizTalk Server Administrators group.  

### To modify the resource based throttling settings of a host  

1. In the **BizTalk Server Administration Console**, expand [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerAdminConsoleui](../includes/btsbiztalkserveradminconsoleui-md.md)], right-click **BizTalk Group**, and then click **Settings**.  

2. In the **BizTalk Settings Dashboard** dialog box, on the **Hosts** tab, click the **Resource Based Throttling** tab.  

3. Do the following, and then click **Apply** to apply the modifications and proceed to another tab. Else, click **OK** to apply the modifications and exit the Settings Dashboard.

This does not include the messages retrieved from database but still waiting for delivery in the in-memory queue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                   1 – Maximum value of type Integer                                    |     1000      |                                                 -                                                 |
   | **Internal message queue size** |                                                Indicate the size of the in-memory queue. This queue serves as a temporary placeholder for delivering messages.<br /><br /> Setting a large value for this parameter may improve low-latency scenarios to some extent since more messages will be proactively retrieved from the MessageBox database for processing. Since the messages in this queue consume memory, setting this parameter to a smaller value may be desirable for scenarios involving large messages in order to avoid memory based throttling of the process. **Note:**  If you modify this value, the host needs to be restarted for the change to take effect.                                                |                                   1 – Maximum value of type Integer                                    |      100      |                                                 -                                                 |
   |     **Message count in DB**     |                                                                                                                              Indicate the total number of messages published by the host instance to the work, state, and suspended queues of the subscribing hosts.<br /><br /> The **Message count in DB** setting also indirectly defines the threshold for a throttling condition based on the number of messages in the spool table or tracking table. If the number of messages in the spool table or tracking table exceeds 10 times this value then a throttling condition will be triggered.                                                                                                                              |                                   1 – Maximum value of type Integer                                    |     50000     |                                                 -                                                 |
