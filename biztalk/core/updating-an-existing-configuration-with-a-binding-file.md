# Updating an Existing Configuration with a Binding File
Information in a binding file supersedes existing configuration information. If the name of an artifact in a binding file matches the name of an artifact in your existing configuration, the artifact in the binding file will update the artifact in your existing configuration when you import the binding file.  
  
 When updating existing artifacts with binding file artifacts, certain rules are followed. This topic discusses the rules that are followed when updating artifacts in an existing configuration with artifacts in a binding file.  
  
 This section assumes that valid values are present in the binding file when the file is imported and does not discuss any scenario where a binding file contains invalid values.  
  
## Rules followed by BizTalk Server when updating a configuration with a binding file  
 BizTalk Server follows certain rules when updating existing artifacts with matching artifacts in a binding file. In general, the following rules are applied:  
  
- Text boxes and check boxes that are exposed when configuring an artifact via the BizTalk Server user interface (such as the BizTalk Server Administration console or BizTalk Explorer), must either be set to a specific value or be empty. Values supplied for artifacts in a binding file will set the user interface value for the updated item accordingly.  
  
- Drop-down boxes that are exposed when configuring an artifact via the BizTalk Server user interface must either be set to a specific value or be set to "None". Values supplied for artifacts in a binding file will set the user interface value for the updated item accordingly.  
  
- Datagrid views that are exposed when configuring an artifact via the BizTalk Server user interface are updated with lists from the corresponding item in the binding file. The list associated with a datagrid view is always overwritten by the list in the binding file unless the datagrid view list is tied to a port or a receive location. In this case the list in the binding file is merged with the existing datagrid view list.  
  
- Artifacts in the binding file are identified by a primary key value. The value associated with the primary key for an artifact can never be set to null in the user interface and so all artifacts in a binding file must have their primary key value set. If the value associated with the primary key for an artifact in the binding file matches the value associated with the primary key for an existing configuration artifact then these artifacts are considered to be identical or matching. If the binding file artifact and the existing artifact are identical then the existing artifact is updated with the binding file artifact as described in the table below. If an artifact in the binding file contains a unique primary key value then a new artifact is created in the BizTalk Server configuration when the binding file is imported.  
  
  The following table describes expected behavior if you are updating existing configuration artifacts with matching artifacts by importing a binding file.

## Unbinding behavior when updating existing artifacts with matching artifacts in a binding file  
 Binding file artifacts are typically configured to reference other artifacts, for example a receive port is typically configured to reference a receive location. In this scenario, the receive port is the parent artifact and the receive location is the child artifact. The receive port is **explicitly** configured to reference the receive location and the receive location then **implicitly** references the receive port. If incompletely configured parent artifacts in a binding file exist, for example a receive port that is not configured with a receive location, then they will be incompletely configured after the binding file is imported regardless of their state in the existing configuration. So for example, if you have an existing receive port myRP configured with receive location myRL and the identical receive port myRP in the binding file is **not** configured with receive location myRL, then the binding file entry takes precedence. For this example receive port myRP will not be configured with a receive location after importing the binding file so you will have effectively **unbound** myRL from myRP.  
  
 This rule only applies when importing artifacts that make explicit references and not when importing artifacts with implicit references. So if you imported a map that implicitly references (is explicitly referenced by) 10 other artifacts you would not have to be concerned that the map would be un-bound from the implicitly referenced artifacts.
