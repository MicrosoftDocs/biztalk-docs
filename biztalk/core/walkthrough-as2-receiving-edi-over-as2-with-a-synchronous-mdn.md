# Walkthrough (AS2): Receiving EDI over AS2 with a Synchronous MDN
This walkthrough provides a set of step-by-step procedures that creates a solution for receiving EDI messages over AS2 transport, returning synchronous MDNs.  

## Prerequisites  
 The following are prerequisites for performing the procedures in this topic:  

- You must be logged on as a member of the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administrators or [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] B2B Operators group.  

- The computer that runs the walkthrough must have Internet Information Services (IIS) 7 installed.  

- If the computer that runs the walkthrough is installed with a 64-bit version of Windows, you must ensure that the BizTalk hosts are marked as 32-bit only. You must also ensure IIS has the Enable 32-Bit Application Setting for the Application Pools set to **True**. For more information, see [Tutorial 3: AS2 Tutorial](../core/tutorial-3-as2-tutorial.md).  

## How the Solution Receives an EDI/AS2 Message and Returns a Synchronous MDN  
 The solution does the following:  

1. Receives an AS2 message containing an EDI interchange over HTTP from the trading partner Fabrikam, and decode the interchange from EDIINT/AS2.  

   > [!NOTE]
   >  The events in this list may not occur in the order shown.  

2. Returns a synchronous MDN to the trading partner using the request-response receive port.  

3. Converts the EDI format of the interchange to internal XML format, and drops it in the MessageBox.  

4. A FILE send port with a PassThruTransmit pipeline picks up the message XML file.  

5. The send port sends the EDI interchange XML file to a folder at the Contoso party.  

   The following figure shows the architecture for this solution.  

   ![AS2 receiving with a synchronous MDN](../core/media/4ff20070-1c36-42e5-af14-832771d63b88.gif "4ff20070-1c36-42e5-af14-832771d63b88")  

## The Functionality in this Solution  
 The following applies to the functionality of this walkthrough:  

-   An EDI acknowledgment is not generated. Generating an EDI acknowledgment is demonstrated in [Walkthrough (X12): Receiving EDI Interchanges and Sending Back an Acknowledgement](../core/walkthrough-x12--receive-edi-interchanges-and-send-back-an-acknowledgement.md). Sending an EDI acknowledgment over AS2 transport is described in [Walkthrough (AS2): Sending EDI over AS2 with a Synchronous MDN](../core/walkthrough-as2-sending-edi-over-as2-with-a-synchronous-mdn.md).  

-   The solution is designed for interchanges using X12 encoding, not EDIFACT encoding.  

    > [!NOTE]
    >  The configuration used for EDIFACT encoding is closely parallel to that used for X12 encoding.  

-   EDI type and extended validation will be performed on the incoming interchange.  

-   AS2 and EDI reporting will be enabled, and transaction sets will be saved for viewing from the interchange status report.  

-   This solution does not configure signing, compression, encryption, or message storage in the non-repudiation database. For procedures on configuring those properties, see [Configuring AS2 Properties](../core/configuring-as2-properties.md).  

## Configuring and Testing the Walkthrough  
 The procedures required for this solution include the following:  

- Build and deploy a BizTalk project with the required message schema, making the schema available for use by [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] in processing the received interchange.  

- Enable the BTS ISAPI filter used in receiving the AS2 message.  

- Create a Contoso virtual directory that receives the AS2 message from Fabrikam, as configured in the receive location.  

- Specify that the Contoso virtual directory is not managed by Windows SharePoint Services.  

- Create a static two-way HTTP receive port for [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] to receive the AS2 message containing the EDI interchange from the trading partner, and send the MDN response. Configure the receive pipeline to be the AS2EDIReceive pipeline and the send pipeline to be the AS2Send pipeline.  

- Create a static one-way FILE send port to route the EDI payload (in XML format) to a local folder. Create the local folder.  

- Create a party (trading partner) for both Fabrikam and Contoso.  

- Create a business profile each for both the trading parties.  

- Create an AS2 agreement between the business profiles for Fabrikam and Contoso. The AS2 agreement would contain properties to send an AS2 message, and receive a synchronous MDN in return.  

- Create an X12 agreement between the business profiles for Fabrikam and Contoso to receive X12 messages.  

- Test the solution by using the HTTP Sender utility that is shipped as part of the AS2 tutorial files. This utility sends a test AS2 message containing an EDI interchange over AS2 transport (X12_00401_864-Sync.edi, also shipped with the AS2 tutorial). You must modify both the HTTP Sender and the test message from the versions that are in the tutorial. These changes are described in the relevant sections below.  

### Configuring the Walkthrough

7.  Perform the following tasks on the **Fabrikam->Contoso** tab.  

    1.  On the **Identifiers** page, enter values for **AS2-From** and **AS2-To**. For **AS2-From**, enter `Fabrikam`. For **AS2- To**, enter `Contoso`.  

8.  Perform the following tasks on the **Contoso->Fabrikam** tab.  

    > [!NOTE]
    >  In this walkthrough, we specify the required value in the tab so that an agreement can be successfully created. To successfully create an agreement, both one-way agreement tabs must have values defined for **AS2_From** and **AS2-To**.  

    1.  On the **Identifiers** page, enter values for **AS2-From** and **AS2-To**. For **AS2-From**, enter `Contoso`. For **AS2- To**, enter `Fabrikam`.  

9. Click **Apply**.  

10. Click **OK**. The newly added agreement is listed in the **Agreements** section of the **Parties and Business Profiles** pane. The newly added agreement is enabled by default.  

#### Create an X12 agreement between the two business profiles  

1. Right-click **Fabrikam_Profile**, point to **New**, and then click **Agreement**.  

2. In the **General Properties** page, for the **Name** text box, enter a name for the agreement.  

3. From the **Protocol** drop-down list, select **X12**.  

4. In the **Second Partner** section, from the **Name** drop-down list, select **Contoso**.  

5. In the **Second Partner** section, from the **Profile** drop-down list, select **Contoso_Profile**.  

    You will notice that two new tabs get added next to the **General** tab. Each tab is for configuring a one-way X12 agreement.  

6. In the **General** tab, on the **General Properties** page, in the **Common Host Settings** section, select **Turn ON reporting**, and then select **Store message payload for reporting**.  

7. Perform the following tasks on the **Fabrikam->Contoso** tab.  

   1. On the **Identifiers** page under the **Interchange Settings** section, enter values for the qualifier and identifier fields (**ISA5**, **ISA6**, **ISA7**, and **ISA8**) that correspond to the values for those header fields in your test message.  

      > [!NOTE]
      >  [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] requires the qualifier and identifier fields for sender and receiver in order to perform agreement resolution. It will match the values of **ISA5**, **ISA6**, **ISA7**, and **ISA8** in the interchange header with those in the properties of an agreement. [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] will also resolve the agreement by matching the sender qualifier and identifier (without the receiver qualifier and identifier). If [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] cannot resolve the agreement, it will use the fallback agreement properties.  
      > 
      > [!NOTE]
      >  For this walkthrough, set **ISA5** to **ZZ**, **ISA6** to **7654321**, **ISA7** to **ZZ**, and **ISA8** to **1234567**.  

   2. On the **Validation** page under the **Interchange Settings** section, make sure **Check for duplicate ISA13** option is unchecked.  

      > [!NOTE]
      >  Clearing the **Check for duplicate ISA13** property enables you to receive multiple instances of the same message.  

   3. If you are using one of the standard schemas shipped with [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], on the **Local Host Settings** page under the **Transaction Set Settings** section, select the namespace for the schema to be used to process the incoming interchange.  


      |       Use this       |                           To do this                            |
      |----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
      |     **Default**      |                Select the checkbox in the column                |
      | **Target Namespace** | Select `http://schemas.microsoft.com/BizTalk/EDI/X12/2006`. |

      > [!NOTE]
      >  Setting the properties enables [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] to determine the schema to be used in processing the incoming 850 interchange. If an interchange has the values of GS02 and ST01 that are entered on a line of the grid, then the target namespace for the same line will be used to determine the schema to be used.  

8. Perform the following tasks on the **Contoso->Fabrikam** tab.  

   > [!NOTE]
   >  In this walkthrough, we specify the required value in the tab so that an agreement can be successfully created. To successfully create an agreement, both one-way agreement tabs must have values defined for **ISA5**, **ISA6**, **ISA7**, and **ISA8**.  

   1.  On the **Identifiers** page under the **Interchange Settings** section, enter values for the qualifier and identifier fields (**ISA5**, **ISA6**, **ISA7**, and **ISA8**) that correspond to the values for those header fields in your test message.  

       > [!NOTE]
       >  For this walkthrough, set **ISA5** to **ZZ**, **ISA6** to **1234567**, **ISA7** to **ZZ**, and **ISA8** to **7654321**.  

9. Click **Apply**.  

10. Click **OK**. The newly added agreement is listed in the **Agreements** section of the **Parties and Business Profiles** pane. The newly added agreement is enabled by default.  

### Testing the Walkthrough  
 This section provides information on how to test the walkthrough.  

#### Test the solution  

1. In [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)], open the Sender.csproj project in the [!INCLUDE[btsBiztalkServerPath](../includes/btsbiztalkserverpath-md.md)]SDK\AS2 Tutorial\Sender folder.  

2. In HttpSender.cs, comment out the following line (immediately below the //Request Asynchronous MDN comment line):  

   ```  
   Stream sr = new FileStream(getBizTalkInstallPath() + @"SDK\AS2 Tutorial\X12_00401_864.edi", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read);  
   ```  

3. Uncomment out the following line (immediately below the //Request Synchronous MDN comment line):  

   ```  
   Stream sr = new FileStream(getBizTalkInstallPath() + @"SDK\AS2 Tutorial\X12_00401_864-Sync.edi", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read);  
   ```  

4. Build this project.  

5. In Windows Explorer, move to [!INCLUDE[btsBiztalkServerPath](../includes/btsbiztalkserverpath-md.md)]SDK\AS2 Tutorial. Open X12_00401_864-Sync.edi in Notepad. Delete the line defining the Disposition-Notification-Options header, and then save the file.  

6. Open a command window. Move to [!INCLUDE[btsBiztalkServerPath](../includes/btsbiztalkserverpath-md.md)]SDK\AS2 Tutorial\Sender\bin\debug. Run **Sender.exe**.  

   > [!NOTE]
   >  Running Sender.exe in this instance posts the message X12_00401_864-sync.edi to the Contoso virtual directory (the BTS HTTP receive location).  

7. Verify that an MDN is displayed in the command window. Verify that in the MDN AS2-From is Contoso and AS2-To is Fabrikam.  

   > [!NOTE]
   >  Sender.exe displays the MDN in the command window.  

8. Open the Contoso local folder that you create to send the EDI payload to (**\EDI_to_Contoso**). Verify that there is a .XML file in the folder. Open the XML file and verify that it contains an 864 transaction set.  

9. Open the test message X12_00401_864-Sync.edi in Notepad, and verify that the transaction set in the output message in the **\EDI_to_Contoso** local folder corresponds to the transaction set in the X12_00401_864-Sync.edi input message.
