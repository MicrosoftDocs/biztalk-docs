# Links To and From the Any Element and anyAttribute Nodes
You must use the **Mass Copy** functoid to map elements containing **any** or **anyAttribute** nodes. BizTalk mapper does not support direct linking between **any** or **anyAttribute** nodes. The **any** and **anyAttribute** nodes, in combination with the **Mass Copy** functoid, are most commonly used to map sections of HTML documents.
