|  Message Text   | Cannot merge operation "{0}" due to communication pattern conflict.  All operations must be one-way or request-response |
  
### Explanation  
 This error indicates [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] is attempting to merge ports with port types that have different communication patterns.  
  
### User Action  
 Using the Port Configuration Wizard, ensure that all the ports that are being merged have the same communication direction, either one-way or request-response.  
  
 For additional information on port configuration, see [How to Run the Port Configuration Wizard](../core/how-to-run-the-port-configuration-wizard.md).
 
## Port types that have a combination of one-way and request-response operations are not allowed

|  Message Text   | Port types that have a combination of one-way and request-response operations are not allowed. Correct service description "{0}" port type "{1}" and rerun the wizard |
  
### Explanation  
 This error indicates the service trying to be consumed has operations that are both one-way and two-way (or request-response).  
  
### User Action  
 Correct the service with the appropriate operations (either one-way or request-response but not both) and try to consume (if you own the WCF services that you are trying to consume). Otherwise, contact the service provider.
