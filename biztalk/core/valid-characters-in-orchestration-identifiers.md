# Valid Characters in Orchestration Identifiers
Orchestration identifiers, such as item, variable and type names, have a few restrictions:  
  
-   The first character of any identifier must be either a letter or the underscore character (_).  
  
-   All subsequent characters must be letters, digits, connecting characters, combining characters, or formatting characters.  
  
-   Most punctuation characters are not allowed in orchestration identifiers.
