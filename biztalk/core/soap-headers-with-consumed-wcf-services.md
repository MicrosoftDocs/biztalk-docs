# SOAP Headers with Consumed WCF Services
To send a message to a WCF service with the custom SOAP headers, these headers must be set in your orchestrations (in the Expression shape, for example) and pipeline components (in code) as the context property **OutboundCustomHeaders**. This context property is in the target namespace **http://schemas.microsoft.com/BizTalk/2006/01/Adapters/WCF-properties**, and contains string representations of the custom SOAP headers.  
  
 The data in the following XML outgoing message shows an example of the string representation of custom SOAP headers for the **OutboundCustomHeaders** property:  
  
```  
<headers>  
<Origination xmlns="http://SOAPHeaderSchemas.OrigDestSOAPHeader">Home</Origination>  
<Destination xmlns="http://SOAPHeaderSchemas.OrigDestSOAPHeader">Work</Destination>  
</headers>  
```  
  
 Inbound SOAP headers also contain string representations of the SOAP headers. The values are similar to creating a request SOAP header.
