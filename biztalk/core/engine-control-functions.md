# Engine Control Functions
This section explains the behaviors associated with several Business Rule engine control functions that allow an application or policy to control the facts in the rule engine's working memory. The presence of facts in the working memory drives the conditions that are evaluated and the actions that are executed.  
  
 This section examines the **Assert**, **Retract**, **RetractByType**, **Reassert**, and **Update** functions for different facts: .NET objects, **TypedXmlDocument**, **DataConnection**, and **TypedDataTable**.
