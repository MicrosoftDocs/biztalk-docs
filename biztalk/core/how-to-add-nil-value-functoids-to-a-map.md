# How to Add Nil Value Functoids to a Map
The **Nil Value** functoid sets the value of the destination node to **Nil**.  

 For conceptual information about the **Nil Value** functoid, see [Nil Value Functoid](../core/nil-value-functoid.md).  

## Add the Nil Value functoid to a map and configure it  

1. With the [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] Toolbox active, click the **Advanced Functoids** tab to select that category of functoids. The list of advanced functoids in the chosen category appears.  

2. Drag the **Nil Value** functoid (![Nil Value functoid](../core/media/advanced-nil-value-functoid.gif "advanced_nil_value_functoid")) from the Toolbox to the appropriate location on a grid page.  

   > [!NOTE]
   >  The functoid will be placed on the displayed grid page. If you want to put the functoid onto a different grid page, you need to display that other grid page first.  
   >
   >  If you are constructing a map that uses more than one functoid, you need to consider their relative left-to-right placement. Functoids are executed from left to right. The output of a functoid can only be input to another functoid that is farther to the right.  

3. The **Nil Value** functoid can have zero to one input parameters. If there is no input parameter for this functoid, the target node is set to **Nil**. To establish the input parameter for the **Nil Value** functoid, create an input link by dragging the output from some other **Logical** functoid or from a variable Boolean field in the input instance message.  

4. To use the output parameter from the **Nil Value** functoid, create an output link by dragging the **Nil Value** functoid to a record or field in the destination schema.  

   > [!NOTE]
   >  As with other functoids, the output of the **Nil Value** functoid can be used as input to another functoid.
