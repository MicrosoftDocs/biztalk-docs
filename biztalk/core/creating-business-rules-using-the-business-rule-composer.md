# Creating Business Rules Using the Business Rule Composer
The Business Rule Composer allows you to create business policies with one or more business rules, and it allows you to deploy these policies. It also allows you to browse for facts (XML, database, and .NET), and use the facts in business rules. In addition, it allows you to create business vocabularies based on facts, and to use the vocabularies in business rules.  
  
 This section provides task-specific information about using the Business Rule Composer to create business rules.
