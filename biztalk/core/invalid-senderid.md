## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that the receive pipeline could not process the incoming interchange because the Sender ID in the ISA06 field or the Sender Identification in the UNB2.1 field did not conform to the data type and number of digits established by the service schema (X12ServiceSchema or the EdifactServiceSchema in BaseArtifacts.dll).  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, make sure that the ISA06 field is of the X12_AN data type and is 15 characters long (with or without trailing spaces) or that the UNB2.1 field is of the EDIFACT_AN data type and is between 1 and 35 characters. Have the interchange resent.
