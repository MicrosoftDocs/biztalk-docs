# Verifying the Deployment Setup
Before you use the BizTalk Server to import a binding file, you must verify the following:  
  
-   The CLASSPATH is pointing to a specific location for the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne-specific files. Verify that the location of these files is the same on the new computer, or edit the binding file.  
  
-   The folders for the responses exist and are identical on the new computer, or edit the binding file.  
  
-   JD Edwards EnterpriseOne system passwords, if present in the configuration, are saved as ***** in the binding file. For more information see [Deployment Limitations](../core/deployment-limitations4.md).
