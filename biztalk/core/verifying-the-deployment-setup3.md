# Verifying the Deployment Setup
Before you use the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] to import a binding file, you must verify that the folders for the responses exist and that they are identical on the new computer, or you must edit the binding file.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  When importing an .msi file in [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] application containing binding information for any of the Enterprise adapters, you may receive an import error message. A supported hotfix is available from Microsoft along with a full description of the error at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=196087](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=196087).
