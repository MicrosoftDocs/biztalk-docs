# Viewing Tracked Message and Instance Data
You can use historical and tracked data to help troubleshoot your BizTalk Server applications. For example, system administrators can use historical and tracked data to:  
  
-   View tracked message events, message properties, and message bodies at various stages in a message’s flow. This data can be used for troubleshooting or auditing purposes.  
  
-   Replay the execution of a specific orchestration instance.  
  
-   Track rule firing events to reconstruct the sequence of events at a later point in time.  
  
-   Query for messages by specifying criteria such as message schema and message property/value pairs. Having thus located the message, users can determine the point in the message flow to which the message has progressed. Advanced users can also create custom SQL Server queries for messages.  
  
-   Search for archived data in an archived database.
