# Error - Generic Generate XML Instance
**Error Code**  
  
 btm1038  
  
 **Explanation**  
  
 BizTalk Mapper was not able to generate an XML instance message file for the source schema of the map. This suggests that there is a problem with the source schema associated with the map.  
  
 **User Action**  
  
 Use BizTalk Editor to open the source schema associated with the map and begin investigating whether there are problems with the source schema. Also, the **Validate Schema** and **Generate Instance** commands, available when you right-click a schema in Solution Explorer, are useful for finding schema errors.
