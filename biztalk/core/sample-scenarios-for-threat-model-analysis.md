# Sample Scenarios for Threat Model Analysis
This section provides the steps and results of a threat model analysis (TMA) for each usage scenario for the sample architecture identified in [Sample Architectures for Small & Medium-Sized Companies](../core/sample-architectures-for-small-medium-sized-companies.md). The purpose of this section is to show you the steps of a TMA. This helps you understand how a TMA works, and describes for you the potential threats we identified for the sample architecture and how we recommend that you reduce their effect.  
  
 We categorize the usage scenarios based on the different adapters you can use with Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], and the use of Enterprise Single-Sign On.  
  
 For each scenario, we followed these steps to complete the Threat Model Analysis:  
  
- Collect background information  
  
- Create and analyze the threat model  
  
- Review threats  
  
- Identify mitigation techniques and technologies  
  
  For more information Threat Model Analysis, see [Threat Model Analysis](../core/threat-model-analysis.md).
