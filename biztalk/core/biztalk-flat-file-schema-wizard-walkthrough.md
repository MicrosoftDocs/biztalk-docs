# BizTalk Flat File Schema Wizard Walkthrough
The following walkthrough shows you how to create flat file schema from flat file document instances using the BizTalk Flat File Schema Wizard.  
  
 To create flat file schema from an interchange instance, you first create the document schema by following the steps described in the walkthrough but only selecting in the part which describes the individual document structure from the interchange instance in the Select Document Data screen instead of selecting the entire interchange instance. Then, you define the envelope schema. For more information about defining an envelope schema and configuring pipeline component for use with document schema and envelope schema, see [Envelope Schemas](../core/envelope-schemas.md) and [How to Configure the XML Assembler Pipeline Component](../core/how-to-configure-the-xml-assembler-pipeline-component.md).
