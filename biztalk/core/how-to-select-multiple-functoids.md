# How to Select Multiple Functoids
When dealing with large maps, you may want to perform operations on multiple functoids at the same time. In such cases, you can select all of the functoids of interest and then perform the operation. This is useful, for example, when you want to move a set of connected functoids, and their connecting links, from one grid page to another.  
  
### To select multiple functoids at the same time  
  
1.  In BizTalk Mapper, in a grid page, click the first functoid to select it. The functoid is highlighted.  
  
2.  In BizTalk Mapper, in the same grid page, hold down the CTRL or the SHIFT key, and then click another functoid to select it as well. This functoid is highlighted too.  
  
3.  Repeat step 2 as required to select all of the functoids of interest.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Multiple selection in a grid page work for functoids and links simultaneously, which is required when moving a set of connected functoids and their connecting links from one grid page to another.
