# Walkthrough: Deploying the Policy
This walkthrough provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the **ProcessPurchaseOrder** policy in the following three ways:  
  
-   Exporting and importing the policy by using the Business Rules Engine Deployment Wizard.  
  
-   Exporting the policy to an XML file and importing the policy from an XML file by using the BizTalk Server Administration console.  
  
-   Exporting the policy as part of an MSI file and importing the MSI file by using BizTalk Server Administration console.

2.  Click **Next**.  
  
3.  On the **Deployment Task** page, select **Export Policy/Vocabulary to file from database**, and then click **Next**.  
  
4.  On the **Policy Store** page, click **Next**.  
  
5.  On the **Export Policy/Vocabulary** page, click **Vocabulary**.  
  
6.  Select **POVocabulary.1.0** from the drop-down list for **Policy/Vocabulary**, type or browse to specify the XML output file name as **C:\BRE-walkthroughs\POVocabulary10.xml**, and then click **Next**.  
  
7.  On the **Ready** page, click **Next**.  
  
8.  On the **Exporting Policy/Vocabulary** page, click **Next.**  
  
9. Select **Run this wizard again**, and then click **Finish**.  
  
     Because you selected **Run this wizard again**, the first screen of the wizard appears again.

13. Click **Finish**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  You need to export both version 1.0 and version 1.1 of **POVocabulary** because **ProcessPurchaseOrder** 1.3 depends on both versions of **POVocabulary**. The **Maximum number of items allowed** definition is used from version 1.1 of the vocabulary. The **Requested Quantity** and **Request Status** definitions are used from version 1.0.

## Comments  
  
-   It is **very important** to remember that when you remove a policy from an application, you do not just remove the association between the application and the policy; you also delete the policy and its associated vocabulary from the rule engine database.  
  
-   When you start an application, by default, it deploys the policies automatically. Similarly, when you stop an application and select **Full Stop - Terminate Instances**, the associated policies are undeployed automatically. When you select **Partial Stop - Suspend running instances**, the associated policies are not undeployed automatically.  
  
-   You should refresh the views in Business Rule Composer and BizTalk Server Administration console to make sure you are looking at the latest information before performing any operation.  
  
-   If you create a new version of the policy whose earlier version is associated with a BizTalk application, you should manually add the new version of the policy to the application. You should not remove the old version of the policy unless you really want to delete it from the rule engine database.  
  
-   You can merge two or more BRL (Business Rule Language XML file) files into a single BRL file before importing. The following code shows three BRL files. The first BRL file contains the **POVocabulary** vocabulary. The second BRL file contains the **ProcessPurchaseOrder** policy. The third BRL file contains both the **POVocabulary** vocabulary and the **ProcessPurchaseOrder** policy. The third BRE file is created by performing the following steps:  
  
    1.  Create a new file using any file editor and save it as an XML file (for example: POPolicyVocabulary.xml).  
  
    2.  Copy the entire XML content from the first BRL file containing the vocabulary.  
  
    3.  Copy the ruleset block (starts with the \<ruleset\> tag and ends with the \</ruleset\> tag) from the second BRL file.  
  
    4.  Save the new file. You can import this single XML file to create the **POVocabulary** vocabulary and the **ProcessPurchaseOrder** policy.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  It does not matter in which order the vocabulary and ruleset nodes are listed in the merged BRL file. You can have the ruleset node ahead of the vocabulary node.
