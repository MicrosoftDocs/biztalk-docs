# How to Use the Call Rules Shape
In Orchestration Designer, you can use the **Call Rules** shape to call a business policy.  
  
### To configure the Call Rules shape  
  
1.  From the Toolbox, in the **BizTalk Orchestrations** tab, drag the **Call Rules** shape onto a connecting line on the Orchestration Design Surface.  
  
     —Or—  
  
     Right-click the connecting line or the shape placeholder where you want to add the shape, point to **Insert Shape** on the context menu, and then click **Call Rules**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  In [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)], you do not need to have an atomic scope to insert a **Call Rules** shape. You can drag a **Call Rules** shape into the Orchestration Design Surface from the Toolbox. However, in [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)], the **Call Rules** menu item is disabled in the context menu if you try to insert a **Call Rules** shape inside an orchestration that does not have an atomic scope. This is a limitation with the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] product.  
  
2.  In Orchestration Designer, select the **Call Rules** shape.  
  
3.  Double-click the shape to display the **CallRules policy configuration** dialog box.  
  
4.  In the **Select the business policy you wish to call** drop-down list, select the policy you need.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Call Rules configuration will look at the latest saved version of a policy when determining the types used in the policy. At run time, the latest deployed version of the policy will be used.  
  
5.  In the **Specify policy parameters** list box, select a variable from the **Parameter Name** property.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  The **Call Rules** shape is essentially reconstructing the message, as if using a **Construct** shape, which in turn may cause context properties of the message to be lost.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  You can specify a message or a .NET variable as a parameter to a BRE policy. To pass a **TypedXmlDocument** fact, specify the corresponding message declared in the orchestration as a parameter. To pass a .NET fact, specify a .NET variable declared in the orchestration as a parameter. To pass a database fact, specify a .NET variable of type **DataConnection** or **TypedDataTable** as a parameter to the policy.
