# How to install the Certificates for Digital Signatures
The following procedure lists the high-level steps that you have to follow to install the certificates for receiving and sending signed messages.  
  
-   To install the certificates in the certificates store to receive signed messages  
  
-   To install the signing certificates for sending signed messages in the certificates store  
  
-   To configure the BizTalk Group for sending signed messages  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can use one certificate for both signing and decryption operations, or you can use one certificate for each function.  
> 
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  You can only specify one signing certificate with which [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] signs all outbound messages. In other words, you cannot use different signing certificates depending on who you are sending the message to.  
  
### To install the certificates in the certificates store to receive signed messages  
  
1. Partner A requests a private-public key pair for digital signatures from the certification authority (CA).  
  
2. Partner A sends you its public key for digital signatures.  
  
3. In [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], log on to the server that has a host instance running a handler that will receive messages from Partner A. Install the Partner A public key certificate to verify their signature in the Other People store. The following figure shows the certificate store where you install the certificate.  
  
    ![Certificates required to receive secure messages](../core/media/bpi-sp-msgsec-certmgmt-certstores-receive.gif "BPI_SP_MSGSEC_CertMgmt_CertStores_Receive")  
  
4. In Partner A, install the Partner A private key certificate for signing messages in the appropriate store. (If Partner A is using [!INCLUDE[btsWin2kSvr](../includes/btswin2ksvr-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[btsWinSvr2k3](../includes/btswinsvr2k3-md.md)], or [!INCLUDE[btsWinSvr2k8](../includes/btswinsvr2k8-md.md)], install the private key in the personal store for the account that will sign messages sent to [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)].)  
  
### To install the signing certificates for sending signed messages in the certificates store  
  
1. An administrator in your organization requests a private-public key pair for digital signatures from the CA for [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] to use.  
  
2. The administrator sends Partner A (and all other partners) the public key for digital signatures.  
  
3. In [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], log on as service account for the host instance running the handler that will send messages to Partner A. Install the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] private key certificate for signing messages in the personal store for the service account. The following figure shows the certificate store where you install the certificate.  
  
    ![Certificates required to send secure messages](../core/media/bpi-sp-msgsec-certmgmt-certstores-send.gif "BPI_SP_MSGSEC_CertMgmt_CertStores_Send")  
  
4. In Partner A, install the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] public key certificate for verifying its digital signature in the appropriate store. (If Partner A is using [!INCLUDE[btsWin2kSvr](../includes/btswin2ksvr-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[btsWinSvr2k3](../includes/btswinsvr2k3-md.md)], or [!INCLUDE[btsWinSvr2k8](../includes/btswinsvr2k8-md.md)], install the public key in the Other people store.)  
  
### To configure the BizTalk Group for sending signed messages  
  
1. Click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerStartMenuItemui](../includes/btsbiztalkserverstartmenuitemui-md.md)], and then click **BizTalk Server Administration**.  
  
2. Right-click **BizTalk Group**, and then click **Properties**.  
  
3. On the **Group Properties** dialog box, click **Certificate**, click **Browse**.  
  
4. On the **Select Certificate** dialog box, select the signing certificate that you installed, and then close all of the dialog boxes.  
  
## Next Steps  
 You create a pipeline to receive signed messages in [How to Configure BizTalk Server for Receiving Signed Messages](../core/how-to-configure-biztalk-server-for-receiving-signed-messages.md).  
  
 You create a pipeline to send signed messages in [How to Configure BizTalk Server for Sending Signed Messages](../core/how-to-configure-biztalk-server-for-sending-signed-messages.md).
