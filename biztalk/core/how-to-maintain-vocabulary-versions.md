# How to Maintain Vocabulary Versions
When you have added vocabulary definitions to a version of your vocabulary, you can save the version to the rule store for further development, or you can publish the version to create a well-defined, immutable set of data-bound terms that are available to users to add to rules as they develop their policies. Note that fact that existing rules will still point to the old versions.  
  
 This topic contains procedures for the following tasks:  
  
-   To save a vocabulary version  
  
-   To publish a vocabulary version  
  
-   To create an updated version of a vocabulary
