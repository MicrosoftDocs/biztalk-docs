# Interceptor Operations
This section contains information about common interceptor configuration file operations. These operations are available to Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) and Windows Communication Framework (WCF) interceptors and to any other interceptors built on top of the Common Interceptor Framework. Both the WF and WCF interceptors extend the common functionality provided by these operators by defining additional, domain-specific operations for retrieving and manipulating interceptor data.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Operation names are case sensitive.
