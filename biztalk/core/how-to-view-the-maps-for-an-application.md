# How to View the Maps for an Application
This topic describes how to use the BizTalk Server Administration console to view the maps contained in a BizTalk application.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform the procedure in this topic, you must be logged on with an account that is a member of the BizTalk Server Administrators group or BizTalk Server Operators group. For more detailed information on permissions, see [Permissions Required for Deploying and Managing a BizTalk Application](../core/permissions-required-for-deploying-and-managing-a-biztalk-application.md).  
  
### To view the maps for an application  
  
1. Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerStartMenuItemui](../includes/btsbiztalkserverstartmenuitemui-md.md)], and then click **BizTalk Server Administration**.  
  
2. In the console tree, expand **BizTalk Server Administration**, expand the BizTalk group containing the application whose maps you want to view, and then expand the application.
