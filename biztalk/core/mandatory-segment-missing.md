|Message Text|Mandatory Segment Missing|  
  
## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that the receive pipeline could not process the incoming X12 interchange because the interchange did not contain a segment that is required by the message schema (for which minOccurs is greater than 0).  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, make sure that the interchange contains all segments required by the message schema, and then have the message resent.
