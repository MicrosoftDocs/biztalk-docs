# How to Control the Size of the Results List
On the **Group Hub** page of the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console, the Query results pane contains so many columns of information that you need to scroll to view them. You can add or remove columns in the pane to display only the information that you need. To add or remove columns, right-click any part of the Query results pane and click **Add/Remove Columns** on the context menu.  

## Prerequisites  
 You must be logged on as a member of the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administrators group to perform this procedure.  

### To add or remove columns in the results list  

1. Right-click any cell in the **Query results** list, and then click **Add/Remove Columns** on the context menu.  

   > [!NOTE]
   >  Items that are already present in the results list appear on the right side under **Displayed Columns**. Items that are not present in the results list appear on the left side under **Available Columns**.  

2. To add a column, select one of the items from **Available Columns** and click **Add** to move that column to the list of **Displayed Columns**.  

3. To remove a column, select one of the items from **Displayed Columns** and click **Remove** to move that column to the list of **Available Columns**.  

   You can control the number of results that the query returns by using the filters that are provided when you create or run a query.  

## Columns in the Query Results List  
 The query results are displayed in the Query results pane at the bottom of the view that originated the query. You cannot directly access the results list. The context menu shows all of the actions you can perform on the selected record within the currently active view. For example, if the record contains a Service Instance ID, then service-related actions appear. If there is a Message ID, then message-related actions appear.  

 Because you might not need all the information contained in this complete list, you can select only those columns you want to view, or you can replace columns that you removed. When you sort the results list by time, the instances sort up to milliseconds, even if no milliseconds appear on the list. When you reuse a saved query the results show only the columns selected each time the query is run.  

 The following table shows a complete list of the items that appear in the results list.
