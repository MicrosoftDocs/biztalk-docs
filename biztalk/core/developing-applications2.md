# Developing Applications
This section contains information for developers who want to create BizTalk Server applications and work with BizTalk Adapter for JD Edwards EnterpriseOne. Once these applications are created, they are usually managed by an administrator using information found in the [Administering BizTalk Adapter for JD Edwards EnterpriseOne](../core/administering-biztalk-adapter-for-jd-edwards-enterpriseone.md) section.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You must use the BizTalk Server File adapter for JD Edward systems installed on the Microsoft Windows platform and the JD Edwards receive for systems that are installed on IBM AS400 systems.
