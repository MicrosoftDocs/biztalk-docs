# Create your application artifacts

This section contains information for developers who want to create BizTalk Server applications and work with BizTalk Adapter for JD Edwards EnterpriseOne. Once these applications are created, then you can [add exception handling](../core/using-biztalk-server-exception-handling3.md) to your orchestration.
