# How to Configure Authentication Options for a Receive Port
This topic describes how to use the BizTalk Server Administration console to configure message authentication options for a receive port. These options take effect when party resolution authentication is configured. The options are:  
  
-   **No authentication.** If this option is selected, the receive port will pass the message through without checking for message credentials.  
  
-   **Drop messages if authentication fails.** If this option is selected, the receive port will check message credentials using Party resolution and discard the message if authentication fails.  
  
-   **Keep messages if authentication fails.** If this option is selected, the receive port will check message credentials using Party resolution and keep the message in the suspended queue if authentication fails.  
  
 For instructions on creating and configuring a party, see [How to Create a Party](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/f6feca1d-bc83-4fb6-981d-26c9e0d53044). For more information about party resolution authentication, see [Authenticating the Sender of a Message](../core/authenticating-the-sender-of-a-message.md) and [Inbound Message Authentication](../core/inbound-message-authentication.md).
