# BAM Interceptor Error Messages
When using the WF or WCF BAM interceptors, you may experience issues ranging from an invalid interceptor configuration file to runtime issues extracting context properties or trying to track events from the reply of a one-way WCF operation.  
  
 The following table contains a list of each of the possible BAM interceptor errors you may encounter while deploying your solution with bm.exe or while your BAM-interceptor-enabled application is running. Each error includes the cause and one or more potential resolutions.  
  
|Event log ID|Error message|Cause|Resolution|
