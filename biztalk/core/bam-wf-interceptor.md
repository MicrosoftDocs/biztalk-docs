# BAM WF Interceptor
The BAM WF interceptor provides comprehensive support for tracking data within your WF application.  
  
 You can use the BAM WF interceptor to:  
  
-   Transparently deliver workflow application data to BAM without having to recompile your WF application.  
  
-   Target specific activities within a workflow to selectively deliver workflow application data to BAM.  
  
-   Honor the transactional semantics of the workflow. Data will be delivered to BAM only if the owning transaction commits.
