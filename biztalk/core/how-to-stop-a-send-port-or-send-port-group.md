# How to Stop a Send Port or Send Port Group
This topic describes how to use the BizTalk Server Administration console to stop a send port or send port group. When you stop a send port or send port group, it no longer processes messages. BizTalk Server suspends all activation messages to a stopped send port or send port group. Stopping a send port group does not affect the state of any send ports that it contains.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  By default, starting a BizTalk application starts all of the artifacts that it contains. For more information, see [How to Start and Stop a BizTalk Application](../core/how-to-start-and-stop-a-biztalk-application.md).  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform the procedure in this topic, you must be logged on with an account that is a member of the BizTalk Server Operators group or the BizTalk Server Administrators group. For more detailed information on permissions, see [Permissions Required for Deploying and Managing a BizTalk Application](../core/permissions-required-for-deploying-and-managing-a-biztalk-application.md).  
  
### To stop a send port or send port group  
  
1. Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerStartMenuItemui](../includes/btsbiztalkserverstartmenuitemui-md.md)], and then click **BizTalk Server Administration**.  
  
2. In the console tree, expand **BizTalk Server Administration**, expand the BizTalk group, expand **Applications**, and then expand the application containing the send port or send port group that you want to stop.  
  
3. Click **Send Ports** or **Send Port Groups**, right-click the send port or send port, and then click **Stop**.
