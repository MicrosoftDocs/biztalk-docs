## Explanation  
 This Warning event indicates that SSO was unable to create a replay and\or progress file when connection to the SSO database was lost.  

 Replay files are used by password sync when the ENTSSO server cannot contact the SSO database. A progress file indicates how far through SSO was able to read the replay file in-case contact with the SSO database is again lost.  

## User Action  
 To resolve this error, do the following:  

- Check System and Application event logs for associated events.
