# Configure SharePoint Services Receive Location
This topic lists the steps to create a [!INCLUDE[btsWinSharePointSvcsNoVersion](../includes/btswinsharepointsvcsnoversion-md.md)] receive location.  

## Create a Receive Location  
 When creating a receive location, the receive location uses the default Receive Handler associated with Transport Type. When using the [!INCLUDE[btsWinSharePointSvcsNoVersion](../includes/btswinsharepointsvcsnoversion-md.md)] adapter, the default Receive Handler is **BizTalkServerApplication**. For the steps to add a new Receive Handler, go to [How to Create an Adapter Handler](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=263646).  

 Create the Receive Location:  

1. In the **BizTalk Server Administration** console, expand **BizTalk Group [*GroupName*]**, expand **Applications**, and then expand the application to contain the receive location.  

2. Create a **One-way Receive Port**. [How to Create a Receive Port](../core/how-to-create-a-receive-port.md) lists the steps.  

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   >  A **Request Response Receive Location** is not configurable with the [!INCLUDE[btsWinSharePointSvcsNoVersion](../includes/btswinsharepointsvcsnoversion-md.md)] adapter.  

    Additional Receive Port configuration options include:  

    [How to Add a Receive Location to a Receive Port](../core/how-to-add-a-receive-location-to-a-receive-port.md): A receive location is added in the next step.  

    [How to Configure Inbound Maps for a Receive Port](../core/how-to-configure-inbound-maps-for-a-receive-port.md)  

    [How to Configure Tracking for a Receive Port](../core/how-to-configure-tracking-for-a-receive-port.md)  

3. Click **OK** to save the settings.  

4. Right-click **Receive Locations**, click **New**, and then click **One-way Receive Location**.  

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   >  A **Request Response Receive Location** is not configurable with the [!INCLUDE[btsWinSharePointSvcsNoVersion](../includes/btswinsharepointsvcsnoversion-md.md)] adapter.  

5. Select the receive port and then click **OK**.  

6. In  **Properties**, enter the **Name** and **pipeline** properties. In the **Type** drop-down list, click **Windows SharePoint Services** and select the **Receive Handler** property.  

7. Click **Configure**. In  **Properties**, configure the following:
