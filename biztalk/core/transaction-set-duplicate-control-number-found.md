## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that the receive pipeline could not process the incoming X12 interchange because the transaction set control number for a transaction set in a group of that interchange was the same as the control number for another transaction set in that group.  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, do one of the following:  
  
-   Change the transaction set control numbers of transaction sets in incoming interchange so there are no duplicate control numbers for transaction sets in a group.  
  
-   Disable the check for duplicate transaction set control numbers as follows:  
  
    1.  Open the BizTalk Server Administration Console.  
  
    2.  Open the EDI Properties dialog box for the party that sent the interchange.  
  
    3.  For X12 interchanges, clear the "Check for duplicate ST2 (Transaction set control number) in group" in the X12 Interchange Processing Properties Page of the EDI Properties dialog box.  
  
    4.  For EDIFACT interchanges, clear the "Check for duplicate UNH1 (Transaction set reference number) in group" property in the EDIFACT Interchange Processing Properties Page of the EDI Properties dialog box.
