# Related Documents
The Related Documents area of the query results detail displays a list of documents that are reference documents that relate to the activity. The documents can be of any type, including a CAD image, a .WAV file, or a purchase order. For example, a Purchase Order activity will typically have a Purchase Order as a base document type. The list will contain a link to the purchase order.  
  
## Adding document references  
 The list of related documents is generated in one of two ways:  
  
-   When you develop your tracking profile you include a Document Reference URL node in the activity tree and then map it from a source containing a reference pointer to the physical document.  
  
-   Your integration developer programmatically populates the list by calling your custom application.  
  
 Defining the document reference using either of these methods adds a row in the \<activityname\>_References table with the document location.  
  
 If neither of these tasks has been performed, the **Related Document** area is blank.
