# Root Nodes
In BizTalk Editor, child nodes of the **Schema** node are known as **Root** nodes. **Root** nodes are a special type of **Record** node, and have a few more properties than regular **Record** nodes. The **Root** node represents the type of document described by the schema, and can be renamed as appropriate. For example, you can rename the **Root** node so that it describes the type of message that the schema represents, such as purchaseOrder, orderAcknowledgment, or shipNotice.  

 When you create a new XML schema in BizTalk Editor, the **Schema** node and one **Root** node are created automatically. You can create additional **Root** nodes as children of the **Schema** node; this enables you to create a library of schemas within a single XML Schema definition (XSD) language representation. For example, you can create a library of schemas to describe the various schemas of messages related to sending purchase orders, naming the various root nodes purchaseOrder, orderAcknowledgment, and shipNotice.  

## XSD representation  
 The following example shows the lines in the XSD representation of the schema that correspond to the **Root** node in the tree view of the schema.  

```  
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16" ?>  
<xs:schema xmlns="http://BizTalk_Server_Project1.Schema2"  
    xmlns:b="http://schemas.microsoft.com/BizTalk/2003"  
    targetNamespace="http://BizTalk_Server_Project1.Schema2"  
    xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">  
    <xs:element name="Root">  
        <xs:complexType />   
    </xs:element>  
</xs:schema>  
```  

 **Root** nodes in BizTalk Editor represent the main element in a corresponding XML instance of the message in question. For example, if the **Root** node of a particular schema is renamed to purchaseOrder, the corresponding XSD representation has the following high-level structure.  

```  
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16" ?>  
<xs:schema xmlns="http://BizTalk_Server_Project1.Schema2"  
    xmlns:b="http://schemas.microsoft.com/BizTalk/2003"  
    targetNamespace="http://BizTalk_Server_Project1.Schema2"  
    xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">  
    <xs:element name="">  
        <xs:complexType>   
            ...  
        </xs:complexType>   
    </xs:element>  
</xs:schema>  
```  

 A corresponding XML instance message must have the following basic structure.  

```  
<?xml version="1.0"?>  
<purchaseOrder ...>  
    ...  
</purchaseOrder>  
```  

> [!NOTE]
>  Root nodes may not have **Field** attributes. **Field** attributes attached to the **Root** node are not saved with the schema.
