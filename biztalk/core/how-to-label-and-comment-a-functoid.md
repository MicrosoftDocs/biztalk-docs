# How to Label and Comment a Functoid
Labels and comments are helpful to document the purpose of a functoid or a link in a map. You can use the **Label** property to provide a name for a functoid. The **Comments** property enables you to provide additional information about the functoid, typically relevant information about the operation being performed by it.  
  
 The following figure shows the label and comments for a functoid. The functoid adds two inputs (Field1 and Field3) from the source schema and outputs the result to Field4 in the target schema. In this example, the functoid label is “Add Field1 and Field3” and the comment is “The addition is an output to Field4”.

 Because a functoid can be a part of very complex mapping, it is important to label it properly and also to provide relevant comments. You can label both functoids and links. For information on how to label a link, see [How to Label a Link](../core/how-to-label-a-link.md).  
  
 You can label and comment a functoid in the following ways:  
  
-   By using the **Configure \<Functoid\> Functoid** dialog box.  
  
-   By using the **Properties** window.
