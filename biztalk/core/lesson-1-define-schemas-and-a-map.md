# Lesson 1: Define Schemas and a Map
In this lesson, you create and build the first project in the enterprise application integration (EAI) solution. The project contains two message schemas, and a map.  
  
 In the EAI solution, a warehouse system sends a request message for inventory replenishment to [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] for processing. In this lesson, you create the following items:  
  
- The EAI solution, to hold the project.  
  
- The project, to hold the schemas and the map.  
  
- The schema, for the message the warehouse sends to [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] to request inventory replenishment.  
  
- The schema, for the message that the warehouse is expecting when a request is rejected.  
  
- A map, for reformatting a request message to create a request decline message.  
  
  Finally you build the project before starting [Lesson 2: Define the Business Process](../core/lesson-2-define-the-business-process.md). In Lesson 2, you create the business process that routes the messages and evaluates the contents of the inventory replenishment request message against approval criteria.
