## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that the receive pipeline could not process the incoming interchange because the Receiver ID in the ISA08 field or the Recipient Identification in the UNB3.1 field did not conform to the data type and number of digits established by the service schema (X12ServiceSchema or the EdifactServiceSchema in BaseArtifacts.dll).  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, make sure that the ISA08 field is of the X12_AN data type and is 15 characters long (with or without trailing spaces) or that the UNB3.1 field is of the EDIFACT_AN data type and is between 1 and 35 characters. Have the interchange resent.
