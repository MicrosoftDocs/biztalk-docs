# Using Policy Explorer
You can use the Policy Explorer to manage policies and rules in the rule store. You can create, modify, and delete policies and rules, and you can test, publish, deploy, and undeploy policies.  
  
 The following table describes the commands within the Policy Explorer that can be used in the process of developing new policies and rules.
