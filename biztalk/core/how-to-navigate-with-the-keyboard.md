# How to Navigate with the Keyboard
You can navigate through the design surface by using your keyboard instead of your mouse. The following table shows the keys that you can use.  
  
|Key|Effect|  
|---------|------------|  
|DOWN ARROW|Moves the cursor to the next connecting line or shape below, including **Start** and **End** shapes.|  
|UP ARROW|Moves the cursor to the previous connecting line or shape above, including **Start** and **End** shapes.|  
|PAGE UP|Changes the cursor focus to the previous starting shape of a stage. This has the effect of scrolling up the page so that the earlier parts of the pipeline are shown.|  
|PAGE DOWN|Changes the cursor focus to the next starting shape of a stage. This has the effect of scrolling down the page so that the next parts of the pipeline are shown.|  
|HOME|Changes focus to the **Start** shape of the pipeline.|  
|END|Changes focus to the **End** shape of the pipeline.|
