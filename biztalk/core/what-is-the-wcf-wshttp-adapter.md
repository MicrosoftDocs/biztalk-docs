# What Is the WCF-WSHttp Adapter?
You can use the WCF-WSHttp adapter to do cross-computer communication with services and clients that can understand the next-generation Web service standards, using either the HTTP or HTTPS transport with text or Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism (MTOM) encoding. The WCF-WSHttp adapter provides full access to the SOAP security, reliability, and transaction features.  
  
 The following table summarizes the characteristics of the WCF-WSHttp adapter.  
  
|Description|Characteristic|  
|-----------------|--------------------|  
|Interoperability level|WS-Profile|  
|Message encoding|Text or MTOM|  
|Boundary|Cross-computer|  
|Transport protocol|HTTP or HTTPS|  
|Security mode|None, Message, Transport, and TransportWithMessageCredential.|  
|Client authentication mechanism|Transport Security and Message Security|  
|Support for WS-ReliableMessaging|No|  
|Support for WS-AtomicTransaction|Yes|  
|Support for one-way messaging|Yes|  
|Support for two-way messaging|Yes|  
|Host type for receive adapter|Isolated|  
|Host type for send adapter|In-process|  
  
 The WCF-WSHttp adapter consists of two adaptersâ€”a receive adapter and a send adapter.  
  
 **WCF-WSHttp Receive Adapter**  
  
 You use the WCF-WSHttp receive adapter to receive WCF service requests through the HTTP or HTTPS protocol. A receive location that uses the WCF-WSHttp receive adapter can be configured as one-way or request-response (two-way).  
  
 **WCF-WSHttp Send Adapter**  
  
 You use the WCF-WSHttp send adapter to call a WCF service through the typeless contract by using the HTTP or HTTPS protocol.  
  
 For more information about WCF receive and send adapters, see [What Are the WCF Adapters?](../core/what-are-the-wcf-adapters.md).
