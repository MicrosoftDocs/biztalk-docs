|Symbolic Name|X12Ta1InvalidAuthorizationValueDescription|  
|Message Text|Invalid Authorization Value|  
  
## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that the receive pipeline could not process the incoming interchange because the value of the Authorization Information in ISA02 did not conform to the data type specified by the schema (X12_AN), or did not have the number of digits required by the schema (10). The schema is the X12ServiceSchema in BaseArtifacts.dll.  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, make sure that the value in the ISA02 header conforms to the X12:AN data type and has 10 digits (with trailing spaces), and then have the interchange resent.
