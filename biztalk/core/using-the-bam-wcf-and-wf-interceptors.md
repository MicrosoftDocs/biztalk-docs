# Using the BAM WCF and WF Interceptors
BAM interceptors extend the BAM interceptor functionality for [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] into Windows Workflow Foundation (WF), Windows Communication Framework (WCF), and other runtime environments. By using a BAM interceptor, you can track your business processes without recompiling your WF or WCF solution — integration is done through a configuration file using XML and a series of elements that map application events to BAM activities and define the data, correlation ID, continuation token and other required and optional artifacts.
