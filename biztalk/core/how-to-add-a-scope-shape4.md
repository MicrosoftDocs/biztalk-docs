# How to Add a Scope Shape
Follow these steps to add a **Scope** shape.  
  
### To add a scope shape  
  
1.  Right-click the arrow below the **ReceiveFromIn** port, point to **Insert Shape**, and then click **Scope**.  
  
     In the Scope shape, you set operations that might have a fault.  
  
     For example, add a send, a receive and a send port in an SQLExecute orchestration. In this example, you send a message to SERVER. SERVER gives a response. It runs the rest of the orchestration and returns information back to the OutFile port.  
  
2.  In the Scope shape, set the **Transaction** to **None**.  
  
3.  Right-click inside the Scope shape and select **New Exception Handler**.  
  
     This creates the **Catch Exception** block. If an exception occurs from the back-end, it is caught inside the **Catch Exception** block.  
  
4.  In the **Catch Exception** block, you must add the logic.  
    The most important logic that you must set is the type of error message that you expect to receive.
