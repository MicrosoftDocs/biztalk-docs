# Troubleshooting SharePoint Services Adapter
This topic focuses on troubleshooting the [!INCLUDE[btsWinSharePointSvcsNoVersion](../includes/btswinsharepointsvcsnoversion-md.md)] (WSS) adapter.

## Installation
 When using the [!INCLUDE[btsWinSharePointSvcsNoVersion](../includes/btswinsharepointsvcsnoversion-md.md)] (WSS) adapter, there are two options:

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| **Use Client OM** set to **Yes** |  **Recommended**. When set to Yes, the [!INCLUDE[btsSharePointSvcsNoVersion](../includes/btssharepointsvcsnoversion-md.md)] Client Side Object Model (CSOM) is used. The adapter is installed when [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] is installed. There are no additional installation steps. **Note:**  The [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] installation also automatically installs the [SharePoint Client Object Model Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=21786)..  |
| **Use Client OM** set to **No**.  | **Deprecated**. Uses the [!INCLUDE[btsSharePointSvcsNoVersion](../includes/btssharepointsvcsnoversion-md.md)] Service Side Object Model (SSOM).<br /><br /> A web service is installed on the [!INCLUDE[btsSharePointSvcsNoVersion](../includes/btssharepointsvcsnoversion-md.md)] computer, which can be on the same computer as [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] or a separate computer.<br /><br /> To install the web service, run the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] installation on the [!INCLUDE[btsSharePointSvcsNoVersion](../includes/btssharepointsvcsnoversion-md.md)] computer and check **Windows SharePoint Services Adapter**. See [Appendix B: Install the Microsoft SharePoint Adapter](../install-and-config-guides/appendix-b-install-the-microsoft-sharepoint-adapter.md) for specific installation steps. |

 **Use Client OM** set to **Yes** is recommended. When set to **Yes**, the web service is NOT installed on the SharePoint computer. If you prefer to use the web service option, you must set **Use Client OM** to **No** on the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)].

## IIS
 **BTSharePointAdapterWS.asmx web service**

 When the [!INCLUDE[btsWinSharePointSvcsNoVersion](../includes/btswinsharepointsvcsnoversion-md.md)] adapter is installed on the SharePoint computer, the BTSharePointAdapterWS.asmx web service is created in IIS on the SharePoint computer. Typically, [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] and SharePoint are installed on different computers. When SharePoint is installed, the content SQL database can be local to the SharePoint computer or on a remote [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)].

 **Application Pool uses Domain account**

 When BizTalk and SharePoint are on different computers, the IIS application pool running the BTSharePointAdapterWS.asmx web service must use a domain account. If [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], the BizTalk databases, [!INCLUDE[btsSharePointSvcsNoVersion](../includes/btssharepointsvcsnoversion-md.md)] and the [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] SharePoint databases are all installed on the same computer, then a local account can be used.

 **Double-Hop Scenario**

 When there are three computers involved ([!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[btsSharePointSvcsNoVersion](../includes/btssharepointsvcsnoversion-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)]), there is a double-hop scenario that requires Kerberos authentication. The SharePoint adapter on the BizTalk computer does a POST request to the BTSharePointAdapterWS.asmx web service on the SharePoint computer. The SharePoint computer then queries its databases on the [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] computer.

 This POST request from the BizTalk adapter must complete successfully. If you suspect an authentication failure, review the IIS logs. By default, the IIS logs are in c:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\W3SVC*x*. The POST request should display a 200 (success) status code. If a failed status code is returned, like a 401.2, followed by a 401.1, following by another 4*xx* error, then authentication may be failing.

 When Kerberos authentication is used, service principal names (SPN) are required and delegation must be enabled.

## Enable Kerberos Authentication
 In a double-hop scenario, Kerberos authentication and enabling delegation are required. Steps include:

1. Enable **Negotiate** on the IIS/SharePoint server. For more information, go to [Windows Authentication `<windowsAuthentication>`](/iis/configuration/system.webserver/security/authentication/windowsauthentication/).

2. Service Principal Names (SPNs) are required for the domain accounts executing the [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] Service and the Application Pool on the IIS/SharePoint computer. For more information about configuring Service Principal Names, go to [Service principal names (SPN)](/windows/win32/ad/service-principal-names).

    [!INCLUDE[btsWinNoVersion](../includes/btswinnoversion-md.md)] 8, [!INCLUDE[btsWinSvr2k8](../includes/btswinsvr2k8-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[btsWinSvr2k8R2](../includes/btswinsvr2k8r2-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[btsWinSrv2k12](../includes/btswinsrv2k12-md.md)]: [SetSPN](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/cc731241(v=ws.11))

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   >  SetSPN requires Domain Administrator rights and can be executed from any computer in the domain.

    To return a list of all SPNs registered to a domain account:

   ```
   setspn.exe -l Domain\UserAccount
   ```

    Create the SPNs:

   1.  Create an SPN for the FQDN of the IIS/SharePoint computer:

       ```
       setspn.exe -s http/IISSharePointComputerName.domain.com domain\IISApplicationPoolDomainAccount
       ```

   2.  Create an SPN for the NETBIOS name of the IIS/SharePoint computer:

       ```
       setspn.exe -s http/IISSharePointComputerNamedomain\IISApplicationPoolDomainAccount
       ```

   3.  Create an SPN for the FQDN of the SQL Server computer used by the IIS/SharePoint computer:

       ```
       setspn.exe -s mssqlsvc/SQLComputerName.domain.com domain\SQLServerServiceDomainAccount
       ```

   4.  Create an SPN for the FQDN and TCP Port of the SQL Server computer used by the IIS/SharePoint computer:

       ```
       setspn.exe -s mssqlsvc/SQLComputerName.domain.com:1433 domain\SQLServerServiceDomainAccount
       ```

   5.  Create an SPN for the NETBIOS name of the SQL Server computer used by the IIS/SharePoint computer:

       ```
       setspn.exe -s mssqlsvc/SQLComputerNamedomain\SQLServerServiceDomainAccount
       ```

   6.  Create an SPN for the NETBIOS name:TCP Port of the SQL Server computer used by the IIS/SharePoint computer:

       ```
       setspn.exe -s mssqlsvc/SQLComputerName:1433 domain\SQLServerServiceDomainAccount
       ```

3. On the Domain controller, go to **Active Directory Users & Computers** and do the following:

   1.  Check **Trust this computer for delegation to any service** for the following computers:

       -   SharePoint/IIS server

       -   SQL Server used by SharePoint

   2.  Check **Account is Trusted for Delegation** and uncheck **Account is sensitive and cannot be delegated** for the following domain accounts:

       -   SQL Server service domain account

       -   IIS Application Pool domain account
