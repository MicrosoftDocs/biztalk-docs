# FTP Adapter Performance Counters
Performance counters allow you to monitor specific aspects of work performed on the site or system by service. Performance counters can help you identify and troubleshoot server performance issues.  
  
 The following performance counters are accessible for each host instance under the **BizTalk:FTP Receive Adapter** and the **BizTalk:FTP Send Adapter** performance object categories:  
  
|**Category**|**Counter**|**Description**|  
|------------------|-----------------|---------------------|  
|BizTalk:FTP Receive Adapter|Bytes received|Total number of bytes received by the FTP receive adapter. The counter is incremented after a message is completely read by the FTP receive adapter from the FTP server.|  
||Bytes received/Sec|Number of bytes received by the FTP receive adapter per second. The counter applies only to messages that have been completely read by the FTP receive adapter from the FTP server.|  
||Messages received|Total number of messages received by the FTP receive adapter. The counter is incremented after a message is completely read by the FTP receive adapter from the FTP server.|  
||Messages received/Sec|Number of messages received by the FTP receive adapter per second. The counter applies only to messages that have been completely read by the FTP receive adapter from the FTP server.|  
|BizTalk:FTP Send Adapter|Bytes sent|Total number of bytes sent by the FTP send adapter. The counter is incremented only for messages that have been written to the destination FTP server.|  
||Bytes sent/Sec|Number of bytes sent by the FTP send adapter per second. The counter applies only to messages that have been written to the destination FTP server.|
