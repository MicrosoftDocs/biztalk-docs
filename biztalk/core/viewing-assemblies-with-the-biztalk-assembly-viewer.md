# Viewing Assemblies with the BizTalk Assembly Viewer
When you are developing applications or deploying assemblies, you need to see which assemblies are deployed and available to you. Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] provides a convenient tool for this purpose - BizTalk Assembly Viewer.  
  
 The BizTalk Assembly Viewer is a Windows shell extension for examining deployed BizTalk assemblies and assembly types. BizTalk Assembly Viewer enables you to:  
  
-   View a list of all BizTalk Server assemblies installed in the global assembly cache (GAC) on your local computer.  
  
-   View the types within a BizTalk Server assembly.  
  
-   View attributes of a BizTalk Server assembly, such as name, version, culture, code base, and public key token.  
  
-   View referenced assemblies for a BizTalk Server assembly.  
  
-   Add assemblies in the GAC.  
  
-   Remove assemblies from the GAC.  
  
-   View the XML code for various types including schemas, maps, orchestrations, and pipelines.  
  
-   Search for particular types across all BizTalk Server assemblies deployed on a given server.  
  
-   Search type dependencies across BizTalk Server assemblies.
