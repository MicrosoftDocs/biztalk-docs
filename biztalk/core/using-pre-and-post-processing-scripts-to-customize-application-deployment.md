# Using Pre- and Post-processing Scripts to Customize Application Deployment
The topics in this section describe how to create pre- or post-processing scripts to perform actions when an application is imported, installed, or uninstalled. Pre-processing scripts perform an action or set of actions before application import or installation starts, and after uninstallation completes. Post-processing scripts perform an action or set of actions after application import or installation completes, or before uninstallation starts.  
  
 You might, for example, want to include a pre-processing script that will run before installation to back up resource files before they are overwritten during installation. Or you might want to run a post-processing script to add a certificate to the certificate store after an application is installed.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  BizTalk Server includes sample pre- and post-processing scripts. For information about using the sample scripts, see [Template (Application Deployment Sample)](../core/template-application-deployment-sample.md).
