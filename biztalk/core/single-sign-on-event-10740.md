## Explanation  
 This Warning event indicates that the Windows Account (specified in the event message) is not valid for application update. This can occur when changing the Windows account for a Host Group application. Host Group applications are used for single sign-on from external systems to Windows systems. They can map a set of external users to a single Windows account. The Windows account they are mapped to is defined in the Application Users field of the application.  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this warning, do the following:  
  
-   Check that the Windows account your are using is valid.  
  
-   Recreate the Windows account with the correct Windows account properties.
