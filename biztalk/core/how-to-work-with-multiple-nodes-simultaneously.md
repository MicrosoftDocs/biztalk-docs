# How to Work with Multiple Nodes Simultaneously
Some operations can be performed on multiple nodes simultaneously, but the relevant nodes must all be selected. This topic provides instructions about how to work with multiple nodes simultaneously.  
  
### To select multiple nodes that are not adjacent  
  
1.  Select the first node in the set of nonadjacent nodes to be selected at the same time.  
  
2.  Press and hold CTRL and then select the remaining nodes in the set of nonadjacent nodes to be selected at the same time.  
  
     The nonadjacent nodes are all selected at the same time.  
  
### To select a range of adjacent nodes  
  
1.  Select the node at one extreme of the set of adjacent nodes to be selected at the same time.  
  
2.  Press and hold SHIFT and then select the node at the other extreme of the set of nodes to be selected at the same time.  
  
     The range of adjacent nodes defined by the nodes selected in steps 1 and 2 are all selected at the same time.  
  
### To modify property values of simultaneously selected nodes  
  
1.  Select multiple nodes, as described in the procedure "To select multiple nodes that are not adjacent". earlier in this document.  
  
2.  Modify the relevant property values in the **Properties** window.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Only properties common to all selected nodes can be changed simultaneously.
