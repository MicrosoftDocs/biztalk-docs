## Explanation  
 This Warning event indicates that SSO failed to update the Windows password in the SSO database. There are various possible causes of failure indicated in the warning message; in some cases, this warning might indicate a configuration problem, or the mapping may have been deleted while the password change was in process.  

## User Action  
 To resolve this warning, do the following:  

- Retry the password change.  

- If additional attempts continue to fail, change the password manually using the UI or command line tools.
