# How to Search for Suspended Service Instances
You can use the **Query** tab in the BizTalk Server Administration Console to search for suspended service instances. You can search for a specific subset of messages to locate a specific message associated with a service name, type, host, etc.  

> [!NOTE]
>  Terminated w/ unconsumed message instances are displayed as an error code (“Terminated with unconsumed messages”) for the pertinent suspended service instances. These instances are non-resumable.  

> [!NOTE]
>  When Grouping and Filtering by URI or error adapter name, only send and receive ports are displayed in the results. Grouping and Filtering by URI is not possible for orchestrations, which are not included in the displayed results.  

## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure, you must be logged on as a member of the BizTalk Server Operators group.  

### To search for suspended service instances  

1. Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Microsoft**[!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3ui](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3ui-md.md)], and then click **BizTalk Server Administration**.  

2. In the console tree, expand **BizTalk Server Administration**, and then click the BizTalk group.  

3. In the details pane, click the **New Query** tab.  

4. In the **Query Expression** group, in the **Value** column, select **Suspended Service Instances** from the drop-down list box.  

5. In the **Field Name** column, in the empty drop-down list box next to the asterisk (**\\***), select one or more of the following:

   |   **Creation Time**   |                                                                                                                                                                                  Find suspended service instances created before or after the specified date.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
   |   **Error Adapter**   | You can group or filter suspended service instances by adapter type. For example: FILE, FTP, HTTP, MQSeries, MSMQ, POP3, SMTP, SOAP,  or Windows SharePoint Services. **Note:**  In the query results, the adapter field is only populated when the BizTalk Server runtime runs into an error while using the specified adater. If the runtime does not find an error with the adapter, in the query results, the Error Adapter field is empty. |
   |    **Error Code**     |                                                                                                                                                 You can group or filter suspended service instances by error code to show all that service instances have been suspended with that error code.                                                                                                                                                  |
   | **Error Description** |                                                                                                                                                                            You can group or filter suspended service instances with the specified error description.                                                                                                                                                                            |
