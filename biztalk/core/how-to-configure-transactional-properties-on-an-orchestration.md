# How to Configure Transactional Properties on an Orchestration
An orchestration can be treated as an atomic transaction, a long-running transaction, or neither.  
  
### To make your orchestration an atomic transaction  
  
1.  In the Orchestration View window, select **Orchestration Properties**.  
  
2.  In the Properties window, select **Atomic** in the drop-down for the **Transaction Type** property.  
  
     **Batch**, **Compensation**, **Isolation Level**, **Retry**, **Timeout**, and **Transaction Identifier** appear as properties in the Properties window, just as they do for any scope. For more information on these properties, see [How to Configure the Scope Shape](../core/how-to-configure-the-scope-shape.md).  
  
### To make your orchestration a long-running transaction  
  
1.  In the Orchestration View window, select **Orchestration Properties**.  
  
2.  In the Properties window, select **Long Running** in the drop-down for the **Transaction Type** property.  
  
     **Compensation**, **Timeout**, and **Transaction Identifier** appear as properties in the Properties window. For more information on these properties, just as they do for any scope. For more information on these properties, see [How to Configure the Scope Shape](../core/how-to-configure-the-scope-shape.md).
