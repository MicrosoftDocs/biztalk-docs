# Single Sign-On Applications
From a programming perspective, you can write two different kinds of applications using Single Sign-On: a traditional Single Sign-On application that uses the Single Sign-On interface to interact with remote applications, and a password sync adapter that uses the Password Sync (PS) Helper interface to synchronize passwords across your enterprise.
