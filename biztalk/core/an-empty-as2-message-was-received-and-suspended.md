## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates BizTalk Server could not process the incoming AS2 message because the message does not contain a body. The body must be separated from the headers by two carriage return/line feeds.  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, do the following:  
  
-   Ensure the sending party adds a body (separated from the headers by two carriage return/line feeds) to the AS2 message before sending it.
