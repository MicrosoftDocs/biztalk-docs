# How to View the Results of an Activity Search
Users can view the results of a query by clicking the **Execute Query** button in the upper section of the content frame of the BAM portal. The results of the query are displayed in the **Results** section at the bottom of the frame.  
  
 The results of an activity search are displayed with one record per row. Each record consists of the data and milestones selected in the column chooser and are displayed in the order in which they were arranged in the **Items to show** box.  
  
 To get additional details about a returned record you can click anywhere in the row.
