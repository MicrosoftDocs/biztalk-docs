# How to View the Results of an Activity Search
Users can view the results of a query by clicking the **Execute Query** button in the upper section of the content frame of the BAM portal. The results of the query are displayed in the **Results** section at the bottom of the frame.  
  
 The results of an activity search are displayed with one record per row. Each record consists of the data and milestones selected in the column chooser and are displayed in the order in which they were arranged in the **Items to show** box.  
  
 To get additional details about a returned record you can click anywhere in the row.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 You must have a deployed activity to perform the procedures in this topic. For information about how to do this, see [How to Apply and Remove a Tracking Profile](../core/how-to-apply-and-remove-a-tracking-profile.md).

3. Click an activity associated with the view to load that activity in the content frame.  
  
4. Create an activity search or open an existing activity search. For information about creating or opening activity searches, see [How to Create a Query in Activity Search](../core/how-to-create-a-query-in-activity-search.md).

6. Scroll down to view the output of the query in the **Results** area of the content frame.
