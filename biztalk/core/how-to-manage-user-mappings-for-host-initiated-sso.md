# How to Manage User Mappings for Host Initiated SSO
Use the following procedures to create mappings, set credentials, and enable or disable mapping.  
  
### To manage user mappings for host initiated SSO using the MMC Snap-In  
  
1.  On the **Start** menu, click **All Programs**, click **Microsoft Enterprise Single Sign-On**, and then click **SSO Administration**.  
  
2.  In the scope pane of the ENTSSO MMC Snap-In, expand the **Enterprise Single Sign-On** node.  
  
3.  In the scope pane, click **Affiliate Applications**.  
  
4.  In the details pane, right-click the affiliate application, and then choose the appropriate menu item for your action.  
  
### To create mappings in host initiated SSO using the command line  
  
1.  On the **Start** menu, click **Run**.  
  
2.  In the **Run** dialog box, type **cmd**, and then click **OK**.  
  
3.  At the command line, go to the Enterprise Single Sign-On installation directory. The default is \<drive\>:\Program Files\Common Files\Enterprise Single Sign-On.

     A sample mapping file is shown below:  
  
    ```  
    <SSO>  
      <mapping>  
        <windowsDomain>DomainName</windowsDomain>  
        <windowsUserId>UserA</windowsUserId>  
        <externalApplication>SSOApplication</externalApplication>  
    <externalUserId>ExternalUserID that corresponds to UserA</externalUserId>  
      </mapping>  
    </SSO>  
  
    ```
