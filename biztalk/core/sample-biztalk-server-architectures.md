# Sample BizTalk Server Architectures
To provide the greatest possible security to your Microsoft® BizTalk® Server environment, it is recommended that you use an architecture where you distribute the BizTalk Servers based on the criticality of the data and services that they contain, and the implication if an attacker compromises the server.  
  
 This section provides information to help you derive your own secure deployment of BizTalk Server to meet the particular needs and challenges of your company and environment.
