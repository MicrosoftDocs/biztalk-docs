# How to Remove a Certificate from a Receive Location
This topic describes how to use the BizTalk Server Administration console to remove a security certificate from a receive location. When you do this, the receive location will no longer encrypt messages; messages will be sent in clear text. Removing a certificate from a receive location does not remove it from the certificate store.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform the procedure in this topic, you must be logged on with an account that is a member of the BizTalk Server Administrators group. For more detailed information on permissions, see [Permissions Required for Deploying and Managing a BizTalk Application](../core/permissions-required-for-deploying-and-managing-a-biztalk-application.md).  
  
### To remove a certificate from a receive location  
  
1. Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerStartMenuItemui](../includes/btsbiztalkserverstartmenuitemui-md.md)], and then click **BizTalk Server Administration**.  
  
2. In the console tree, expand the BizTalk group and the BizTalk application for which you want to remove a certificate from a receive location.  
  
3. Expand **Receive Locations**, right-click the receive location, click **Properties**, and then click **Certificates**.  
  
4. Click **Remove certificate**, and then click **OK**.
