# TIBCO Rendezvous Limitations
In TIBCO Rendezvous, field name uniqueness is not guaranteed. If a TIBCO Rendezvous message contains two field names that are the same, the resulting XML is not valid.  
  
 Other limitations include the following:  
  
-   Field ordering/sorting is not provided.  
  
-   According to TIBCO Rendezvous documentation, non-printable characters are not used in subject names; however, it is still possible that such characters are used. BizTalk Adapter for TIBCO Rendezvous does not support subject names containing those characters.  
  
-   Secure connection to daemons is not supported.  
  
-   Custom data types are not supported.  
  
-   Certified Messaging is not supported on the transmit side.
