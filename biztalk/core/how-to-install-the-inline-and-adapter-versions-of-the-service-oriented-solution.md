# How to Install the Inline and Adapter Versions of the Service Oriented Solution
The following steps describe how to prepare the computer for installing the inline and adapter versions of the service oriented solution, and how to install the solution on this computer.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  - The service oriented solution is located in the folder \<*BizTalk Server Installation Folder*\>\SDK\Scenarios\SO.  
>  - If you donâ€™t have a mainframe for the solution, you can modify the port binding to use the stub Web service for Pending Transactions. The Web service generates transactions locally to emulate the mainframe transactions.  
  
##  <a name="step1"></a> Prepare the computer for installing the adapter and inline versions of the Service Oriented Solution  
  
1.  If you installed Windows SharePoint Services, exclude the (root) of the Default Web Site from Windows SharePoint Services Managed Paths as follows: Click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to **Administrative Tools**, and then click **SharePoint Central Administration**.  
  
    1.  Under **Virtual Server Configuration**, select **Configure virtual server settings**.  
  
    2.  On the **Virtual Server List** page, click **Default Web Site**.  
  
    3.  On the **Virtual Server Settings** page, click **Define managed paths**.  
  
    4.  In the **Included Paths** section of the **Defined Managed Path** page, select **Root** and then click **Remove selected paths**.  
  
    5.  At a command prompt, perform an IISReset.  
  
2.  Click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to **Administrative Tools**, click **Computer Management** console, and then add the BizTalk service account to the local Administrators group.  
  
3.  Log off the computer, and then log on to the computer as the BizTalk service account.  
  
4.  At a command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER to set the %BTSSolutionsPath% environment variable. Then, exit the command prompt.  
  
    -   setx BTSSolutionsPath [!INCLUDE[btsBiztalkServerPath](../includes/btsbiztalkserverpath-md.md)]SDK\Scenarios"  
  
        > [!NOTE]
        >  If you are using a 64-bit computer, use %ProgramFiles(x86)% instead of %ProgramFiles%.  
  
        > [!NOTE]
        >  For more information about the SETX command, see the Microsoft TechNet Web site at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=67831](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=67831).  
  
##  <a name="step3"></a> Remove the stub version of the Service Oriented Solution  
  
1.  Open the **BizTalk Server Administration Console** as follows: Click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3ui](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3ui-md.md)], and then click **BizTalk Server Administration**.  
  
2.  In the **BizTalk Server Administration Console**, expand **BizTalk Server Administration**, expand **BizTalk Group**, expand **Applications**, right-click **BTSScn.SO.CustomerService**, and then click **Stop**. In the **Stop Application** dialog box, select **Full Stop - Terminate Instances**, and then click **Stop**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  You don't need to remove the stub version for installing the inline and adapter versions. If you want to put all the versions together, you should skip this step.  
  
3.  Open a command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER. This command changes the default script host to CScript.exe:  
  
    -   `cscript /H:CScript`  
  
4.  At the command prompt, change the current directory to %BTSSolutonsPath%\SO\BTSSoln\Scripts folder, type the following command, and then press ENTER:  
  
    -   `UnEnlistStub.vbs`  
  
5.  At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:  
  
    -   `UndeployStub.vbs`  
  
6.  At the command prompt, run the following command  
  
     SET PATH=%PATH%;[!INCLUDE[btsBiztalkServerPath](../includes/btsbiztalkserverpath-md.md)]Tracking"  
  
     This sets the path to find the BAM utilities.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If you are using a 64-bit computer, type `%ProgramFiles(x86)%` instead of `%ProgramFiles%`.  
  
7.  At the command prompt, change the directory to %BTSSolutionsPath%\SO\BTSSoln\BAM, and then run the following command:  
  
    -   `bm remove-all -DefinitionFile:ServiceLevelTracking.xml`  
  
8.  At the command prompt, change the directory to \<*Enterprise Single Sign-On Install Directory*\>, and then run the following command:  
  
    -   `ssomanage -tickets no no`  
  
9. At the command prompt, run the following command to delete the WoodgroveBank.CustomerService SSO Affiliated application:  
  
    -   `ssomanage -deleteapp WoodgroveBank.CustomerService`  
  
10. At the command prompt, run the following commands to delete the Web sites used by the stub version. For more information about iisvdir.vbs, see the Microsoft TechNet Web site at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=67830](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=67830).  
  
    -   `iisvdir /delete W3SVC/1/ROOT/Microsoft.Samples.BizTalk.WoodgroveBank.OrchProxy.Stub`  
  
    -   `iisvdir /delete W3SVC/1/ROOT/Microsoft.Samples.BizTalk.WoodgroveBank.StubSAP`  
  
    -   `iisvdir /delete W3SVC/1/ROOT/Microsoft.Samples.BizTalk.WoodgroveBank.StubPendingTransactions`  
  
    -   `iisvdir /delete W3SVC/1/ROOT/Microsoft.Samples.BizTalk.WoodgroveBank.StubPaymentTracker`  
  
11. Start Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager as follows: Click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to **Administration Tools**, and then click **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager**.  
  
    -   Expand the **Application Pools**, right-click the application pool you crated for the previous Web applications, click **Delete**, and then click **OK** in the confirmation dialog box.  
  
12. Click **Start**, point to **Control Panel**, click **Add or Remove Programs**, and then uninstall the IBM WebSphere MQ Client for Windows.  
  
13. Start **Visual Studio Command Prompt** and then run the following command to delete the amqmdnet.dll you installed for the stub version.  
  
    -   `gacutil /u amqmdnet`  
  
##  <a name="step5"></a> Prepare the back-end systems for the Service Oriented Solution to access  
  
1.  Install IBM WebSphere MQ for Windows Server on the local computer.  
  
    1.  Keep all the default settings. Set up the **Default Configuration** at the end of the **Prepare WebSphere MQ Wizard**. The queue manager is named as QM_\<*your computer name*\>.  
  
    2.  Install the Fix Pack 10 (CSD10). Keep all the default settings.  
  
2.  Install the MQSeries Agent.  
  
    1.  Rerun the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)] setup program.  
  
    2.  On the **Program Maintenance** page, select **Modify**, and then click **Next**.  
  
    3.  On the **Component Installation** page, expand the **Additional Software** node, and then select **MQSeries Agent**.  
  
    4.  On the **Completion** page, make sure that **Launch BizTalk MQSeries Agent Configuration Wizard** is not selected.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  The **MQSeries Agent** check box is activated only after the IBM WebSphere MQ for Windows is installed.  
  
3.  Open a **Visual Studio Command Prompt**, change the directory to the \<*IBM MQSeries Installation Directory*\>\bin folder, and then run the following command:  
  
    -   `gacutil /i amqmdnet.dll`  
  
4.  Install Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] if you want to install Microsoft Host Integration Server 2004 to access the mainframe. In the setup program, on the **Options** page, select **Visual C# .NET**, and then clear other components checkboxes. You don't need to install other components than the **Visual C# .NET**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  The TI Designer in Host Integration Server 2004 requires [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNet2003](../includes/btsvstudionet2003-md.md)].  
  
5.  Install and configure Microsoft Host Integration Server 2004 if you have a mainframe to be accessed. Keep all the default settings.  
  
#### Create the MQSeries queues  
  
1.  Open the WebSphere MQ Explorer, expand **Queue Managers**, and then expand the queue manager in which you want to create the queues. Typically, a queue manager is named as QM_\<*your computer name*\>.  
  
2.  In the WebSphere MQ Explorer, right-click **Queues**, point to **New**, click **Local Queue**, and then create the following local queues for the adapter version of the solution:  
  
    -   AdapterSOAInputQueue  
  
    -   AdapterSOAOutputQueue  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  The queues can share an MQSeries cluster, but they are not required to do so.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  MQSeries queue manager names and queue names are case sensitive.  
  
3.  Repeat the previous step to create the following local queues for the inline version:  
  
    -   InlineSOAOutputQueue  
  
    -   InlineSOAInputQueue  
  
4.  Repeat the previous step to create the following local queues for the Payment Tracker simulator. (The Payment Tracker simulator is used in both the adapter and inline versions):  
  
    -   LastPaymentsInputQueue  
  
    -   LastPaymentsOutputQueue  
  
#### Complete configuration of the MQSeries adapter  
  
1.  Click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerStartMenuItemui](../includes/btsbiztalkserverstartmenuitemui-md.md)], and then click **BizTalk MQSeries Agent Configuration Wizard**.  
  
2.  On the **Welcome** page, click **Next**.  
  
3.  On the **Application Identity** page, select **This User**, and then enter the user name and password. The COM+ application for the MQSeries Agent will run under this user account. For this walkthrough, use the same user account that the BizTalk service is using. If it is not, the user accounts for BizTalk services hosting the MQSeries Adapter must be added to the **CreatorOwner** role of the COM+ application.  
  
4.  Click **Yes** on the **MQSConfigWiz** dialog box, if prompted that the user account that you entered in the previous step has the administrative privilege.  
  
5.  On the **Name of Role** page, click **Next**.  
  
6.  On the **Creating the MQSAgent COM+ Application** page, click **Next**, and then click **Finish** on the **Completion** page.  
  
#### Configure the mainframe CICS application  
  
1.  Using Notepad, open the bizcbl.txt and its "copy book" (MainFrameProgramVTCS2Description.txt) in the %BTSSolutionsPath%\SO\MFAccess\HISTIComponent folder, and then review the contents.  
  
    -   Bizcbl.txt includes the COBOL procedure returning the randomized account statements from account number input.  
  
    -   MainFrameProgramVTCS2Descriptoin.txt contains COMMAREA which describes the input and output data information. COMMAREA is a block of contiguous memory used to pass data back and forth between called and calling programs.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  You can also use the copy book to generate the Transaction Integrator (TI) metadata file using Visual Studio with the TI Designer plug-in.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Although the following steps are crucial to the successful deployment, they are not usually performed by the BizTalk Server developer. You must rely on the mainframe personnel to properly configure the mainframe environment. The software required for this walkthrough is usually installed in the most mainframe environments. For more information about the minimum mainframe operating system environment, see the Host Integration Server documentation.  
  
2.  Copy the COBOL code to the host by method like FTP.  
  
3.  Compile the COBOL code and copy book. The following code shows a sample of Job Control Language (JCL) for the COBOL compiler.  
  
    ```  
    //COB      EXEC PGM=IGYCRCTL,  
    //            PARM=&COBPARM,  
    //            REGION=&REG  
    //STEPLIB  DD DSN=&COMPINDX..SIGYCOMP,DISP=SHR  
    //SYSLIB   DD DSN=&INDEX..SDFHCOB,DISP=SHR  
    //         DD DSN=&INDEX..SDFHMAC,DISP=SHR  
    //         DD DSN=&HLQ..&COMP..COBCOPY,DISP=SHR  
    //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=&OUTC  
    //*SYSPRINT DD DSN=&&INPUT,DISP=(,PASS),UNIT=SYSDA,  
    //*         SPACE=(TRK,(100,50)),  
    //*         DCB=(DSORG=PS,LRECL=121,BLKSIZE=2420,RECFM=FBA)  
    //SYSIN    DD DSN=&&SYSCIN,DISP=(OLD,DELETE)  
    //SYSLIN   DD DSN=&&LOADSET,  
    //            DISP=(MOD,PASS),  
    //            UNIT=&WORK,  
    //            SPACE=(80,(250,100))  
    //SYSUT1   DD UNIT=&WORK,SPACE=(460,(350,150))  
    //SYSUT2   DD UNIT=&WORK,SPACE=(460,(350,150))  
    //SYSUT3   DD UNIT=&WORK,SPACE=(460,(350,150))  
    //SYSUT4   DD UNIT=&WORK,SPACE=(460,(350,150))  
    //SYSUT5   DD UNIT=&WORK,SPACE=(460,(350,150))  
    //SYSUT6   DD UNIT=&WORK,SPACE=(460,(350,150))  
    //SYSUT7   DD UNIT=&WORK,SPACE=(460,(350,150))  
    ```  
  
4.  Link edit the compiled source to create the executable. The following code shows a sample of JCL for COBOL link edit.  
  
    ```  
    //LKED     EXEC PGM=IEWL,REGION=&REG,  
    //            PARM=&LNKPARM,COND=(5,LT,COB)  
    //SYSLIB   DD DSN=&INDEX..SDFHLOAD,DISP=SHR  
    //         DD DSN=CEE.SCEELKED,DISP=SHR  
    //         DD DSN=&TCPINDX..SEZATCP,DISP=SHR  
    //SYSLMOD  DD DSN=&LMINDX..&COMP..LOADLIB,DISP=SHR  
    //SYSUT1   DD UNIT=&WORK,  
    //            DCB=BLKSIZE=1024,  
    //            SPACE=(1024,(200,20))  
    //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=&OUTC  
    //SYSLIN   DD DSN=&&LOADSET,DISP=(OLD,DELETE)  
    //         DD DSN=&&COPYLINK,DISP=(OLD,DELETE)  
    ```  
  
5.  Configure the CICS mainframe application.  
  
    -   In this step, the mainframe systems programmer or CICS developer must install TCPIPSERVICE, Session, Connection, Transaction, and Program resource definitions.  
  
    -   You should consult with mainframe administrators to get an IP address, port number, and a Link to Program name that you can access.  
  
        > [!NOTE]
        >  This walkthrough assumes that the mainframe uses a CICS application server and that the programming model for the transaction is TCP/IP (Enhanced Listener Mode (ELM) Link).
