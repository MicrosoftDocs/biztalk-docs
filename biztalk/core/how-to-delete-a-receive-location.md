# How to Delete a Receive Location
This topic describes how to use the BizTalk Server Administration console to delete a receive location. When you delete a receive location, it is removed from the BizTalk Management database and is no longer displayed in the BizTalk Server Administration console.  
  
 When deleting a receive location, bear in mind the following important points:  
  
-   Before you can delete a receive location, it must first be disabled, as described in [How to Disable a Receive Location](../core/how-to-disable-a-receive-location.md).  
  
-   You cannot delete the primary receive location for a receive port. If you attempt this, you will receive an error message. To delete the receive location, you can either delete the receive port, which also deletes all of the receive locations that it contains, or you can make a different receive location primary and then delete the original receive location. For instructions on making a receive location the primary receive location, see [How to Edit the Properties of a Receive Location](../core/how-to-edit-the-properties-of-a-receive-location.md).  
  
-   After you delete a receive location, restart the Isolated Host Worker Processes corresponding to the deleted receive location.
