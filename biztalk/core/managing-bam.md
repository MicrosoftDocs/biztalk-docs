# Managing BAM
Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) empowers business users by providing real-time access to critical business performance indicators. Business users can use this information to improve the speed and effectiveness of business operations. BAM collects the business activity information in a real-time, transaction-consistent way regardless of the complexity of a heterogeneous environment.
