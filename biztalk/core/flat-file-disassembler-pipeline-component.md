# Flat File Disassembler Pipeline Component
The Flat File Disassembler component parses delimited and positional flat file format messages and converts them into an XML representation. The Flat File Disassembler also removes the header and trailer structures from the flat file message, and breaks the interchange within the message into individual documents. It also promotes properties from the documents and headers.  
  
 For more information about flat files, see [Flat File Messages with Positional Records](../core/flat-file-messages-with-positional-records.md). Also see [Flat File Messages with Delimited Records](../core/flat-file-messages-with-delimited-records.md).  
  
 For information about configuring the Flat File Disassembler pipeline component, see [How to Configure the Flat File Disassembler Pipeline Component](../core/how-to-configure-the-flat-file-disassembler-pipeline-component.md).
