## Explanation  
 This error indicates that the transaction was set to be enabled for a WCF request-response receive location. Transactions are not supported in BizTalk for a request-response receive location due to the message box database.  

## User Action  
 For the standard WCF adapters, go to the code configuring the request-response receive location. Ensure that the **EnableTransaction** element in the XML data for the **TransportTypeData** property of the **ITransportInfo** interface is set to **False**.  

 For the WCF-Custom adapters:  

1. Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerStartMenuItemui](../includes/btsbiztalkserverstartmenuitemui-md.md)], and click **BizTalk Server Administration**.  

2. In the Console Root, expand [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerAdminConsoleui](../includes/btsbiztalkserveradminconsoleui-md.md)], expand **BizTalk Group**, and expand **Applications**.  

3. Locate your application and then locate your transport.  

4. Right-click the transport name.  

5. Click **Properties**.  

6. In the port **Type** list, select the correct port.  

7. Click **Configure**.  

8. In the **WCF [**<em>transport type</em>**] Transport Properties** dialog box, click the **Binding** tab.  

9. Ensure that the transactionFlow property is set to **False**.
