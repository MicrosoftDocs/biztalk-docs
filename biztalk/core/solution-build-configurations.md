# Solution Build Configurations
As with other projects that you build in [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)], you can use Configuration Manager to specify solution build configurations. Solution build configurations enable you to determine which projects to include in builds of a solution and if they will be deployed. [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)] supports both **Debug** and **Release** build configurations.  
  
 A solution build configuration with a check mark in the **Build** column enables you to build a solution and to generate an assembly when you are finished. If a check mark is also present in the **Deploy** column, then the application will be deployed based on deployment settings in the Project Designer.  
  
 A complete reference to Configuration Manager and the configuration options provided by the dialog box can be found at the following reference link: [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=125365](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=125365).  
  
### To configure build properties in Configuration Manager  
  
1.  On the **Build** menu, click **Configuration Manager**.  
  
2.  In the **Configuration Manager** dialog box, select one of following to configure the build properties.  
  
    |Use this|To do this|  
    |--------------|----------------|  
    |**Configuration**|Choose from **Release** or **Debug** configurations for the project. Alternatively, create a new configuration or edit an existing one.|  
    |**Platform**|Choose a platform for the project representing the CPU architecture of the compiled assembly. Alternatively, create a new platform or edit an existing one.|  
    |**Build**|Check the box in this column for a project to have the project built or rebuilt in response to a build command for the solution.|  
    |**Deploy**|Check the box in this column to have the project deployed based on deployment settings when a build command is issued for the solution or project.|
