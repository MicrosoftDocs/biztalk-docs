# Configure send port tracking in BizTalk Server
Use the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console to configure tracking for a send port, such as options to view message bodies and promoted properties. This helps you monitor the health of your BizTalk implementation and identify any bottlenecks. The tracking settings that you configure apply to all of the instances of the send port.  
  
 For more information about the message event and service instance tracking features of [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], see [Viewing Tracked Message and Instance Data](../core/viewing-tracked-message-and-instance-data.md)  
  
## Prerequisites  
Sign in with an account that is a member of the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administrators group. For more detailed information about permissions, see [Permissions Required for Deploying and Managing a BizTalk Application](../core/permissions-required-for-deploying-and-managing-a-biztalk-application.md).  
  
## Enable tracking on a send port  
  
1.  In **BizTalk Server Administration**, expand the BizTalk group, and then expand your BizTalk application that has the send port.  
  
2.  Select **Send Ports**, right-click the send port, select **Properties**, and then select **Tracking**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  One send port can be associated with only one send pipeline. If message body tracking is disabled on the send pipeline, then nothing is tracked on the send port. In such a scenario, you can disable the "Tracking" options on that send port.  
  
3.  Use the following details to enable the tracking options you want, and then select **OK** to save your changes.
