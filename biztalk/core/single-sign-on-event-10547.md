|  Message Text   | Failed to update the credentials in the SSO database during re-encryption |

## Explanation  
 This Warning event indicates that it was not possible to update the credentials with the result of the new encryption. When the master secret is changed, either by generating a new secret or by restoring an old secret, a re-encryption is performed on the SSO database to decrypt all the secrets encrypted with the old secret, and re-encrypt them with the new secret. This event can occur if the credentials were deleted as they were in the process of being re-encrypted.  

## User Action  
 To resolve this warning, do the following:  

- Wait for another re-encryption to occur after a short delay; if that does not occur automatically, restart the SSO service which will trigger a new re-encryption if one is required.
