# Single Sign-On: Event 10547
## Details  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Product Name|Enterprise Single Sign-On|  
|Product Version|[!INCLUDE[btsSSOVersion](../includes/btsssoversion-md.md)]|  
|Event ID|10547|  
|Event Source|ENTSSO|  
|Component|CO|  
|Symbolic Name|SSO_WARN_UPDATE_FAILED|  
|Message Text|Failed to update the credentials in the SSO database during re-encryption|  
  
## Explanation  
 This Warning event indicates that it was not possible to update the credentials with the result of the new encryption. When the master secret is changed, either by generating a new secret or by restoring an old secret, a re-encryption is performed on the SSO database to decrypt all the secrets encrypted with the old secret, and re-encrypt them with the new secret. This event can occur if the credentials were deleted as they were in the process of being re-encrypted.  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this warning, do the following:  
  
-   Wait for another re-encryption to occur after a short delay; if that does not occur automatically, restart the SSO service which will trigger a new re-encryption if one is required.
