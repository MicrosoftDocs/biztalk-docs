# BizTalk Server core documentation
The [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] core documentation includes a variety of resources that can help you learn to develop, deploy, administer, and use [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)].  

> [!NOTE]
> The core documentation  applies to  [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] 2013, and newer versions, but many topics still apply to previous BizTalk versions. For these previous BizTalk versions, it may be best to use that documentation set. Use the links at [Microsoft BizTalk Server](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd547397\(BTS.10\).aspx) for previous versions.  

## Get started
**[Getting started](../core/getting-started-with-biztalk-server.md)** includes information about common tasks, the message engine, trading partner management using EDI and AS2, BizTalk Server tutorials, and topics for new  [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] users.
  
[Common Tasks and walkthroughs](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cd02757d-48c6-4ba4-b72d-02acd0b1eff1) and [Tutorials](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/1e404aca-6e25-4189-a0cc-5e9b95194b81) are also a great way to get started.

## Feature Pack 
**[Configure the feature pack](../core/configure-the-feature-pack.md)** lists the different updates available in the feature pack, including using Application Insights and Power BI for tracking data, automatic deployment with Visual Studio Team Services, and more good stuff. 
  
## Plan and architect your applications
**[Planning and architecture](../core/plan-and-architect-your-biztalk-server-solution.md)** covers architecture, performance and capacity, high availability, and security. Also read about designing, building, and running two complete model [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] solutions: a service-oriented solution, and a business process management solution.

## Business-to-business messaging
**[B2B messaging](../core/trading-partner-management-using-biztalk-server.md)** describes the building blocks for a B2B solution, how EDI and AS2 are implemented, and includes walkthroughs and tutorials to do it yourself. You can also go more in-depth using acknowledgments, batching, monitoring your solutions. 

## Secure and protect your data
**[Secure and protect](../core/secure-and-protect-your-biztalk-messages.md)** shows you how to secure messages you receive and message you send. Also read about certificates used for encryption and signing, and access control using Windows groups.

## Create maps, pipelines, and orchestrations
**[Develop your applications](../core/develop-your-biztalk-applications.md)** by using and creating schemas, maps, pipelines, orchestrations, web services, and WCF services to build your BizTalk workflows. Also learn how to deploy your projects from Visual Studio, create custom adapters and pipelines, and use the SDK samples and utilities.
  
Shortcut straight to [samples in the SDK](../core/samples-in-the-sdk.md).
  
## Administer and manage
**[Administer and complete operational tasks](../core/operational-and-administrative-tasks-in-your-biztalk-environment.md)** is geared toward BizTalk Administrators. Some tasks include using the BizTalk Administration console to monitor your instances, manage servers in your groups, manage your artifacts and binding files, including exporting and importing applications. Use this section to use the built-in adapters, implement single sign-on, and use the SQL Agent jobs to maintain your BizTalk databases.

Shortcut straight to [using adapters](../core/using-adapters.md).

## Use BAM to monitor activities
**[Use Business Activity Monitoring](../core/using-business-activity-monitoring.md)** to learn about the BAM infrastructure, including BAM definitions, using aggregations, and querying BAM data. Also learn how to add BAM activities, work with BAM APIs and XML files, use the BAM portal to create queries and set alerts, using Excel, and other management tasks.

## Troubleshoot
**[Troubleshoot](../core/troubleshooting.md)** performance, adapters, and learn about the BizTalk Server tools.

Also check out our [community resources](../core/community-resources5.md).

## Performance counters, command-line, and developer reference
 
**[Technical Reference](../core/technical-reference5.md)** describes the different performance counters, command-line reference, developer's reference, and more key reference topics.
