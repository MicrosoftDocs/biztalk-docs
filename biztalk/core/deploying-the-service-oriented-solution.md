# Deploying the Service Oriented Solution
Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an approach to building distributed systems. The service oriented solution demonstrates how several back-end systems using different protocols can be aggregated into a single service that clients can consume. This solution integrates services with an approach that guarantees delivery and performance characteristics.  
  
 The service oriented solution is modeled after a service-level agreement scenario in which BizTalk Server and the Line of Business (LOB) application servers connected to it are given three seconds to respond with a service request. One of those three seconds may be taken up by the BizTalk Server.  
  
 The topics in this section describe how to install and test the service oriented solution on a single computer and multiple production servers.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  There are three versions of the service oriented solution: adapter, inline, and stub. For more information about the differences between three versions of the service-oriented solution, see [Understanding the Service Oriented Solution](../core/understanding-the-service-oriented-solution.md).  
  
 **Reader Guidance**  
  
 This document assumes that you are familiar with BizTalk Server, Windows Server, and Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)]. It also assumes that you understand basic concepts about enterprise application integration and Web services. Additionally, we recommend that you are familiar with how to build applications by using [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] and that you are familiar with creating projects, setting references, and using the debug mode to debug and test your solution. For more information about the prerequisite skills and knowledge for IT professionals and developers, see [Prerequisite Skills and Knowledge](../core/prerequisite-skills-and-knowledge5.md).
