# Pipelines-AssemblerDisassembler (BizTalk Server Samples Folder)
Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] includes three assembler/disassembler pipeline samples in its software development kit (SDK). This section provides detailed information about the functionality that each assembler/disassembler sample demonstrates, instructions for building and running the samples, and the results you can expect.  
  
## In This Section  
  
-   [FlatFileReceive (BizTalk Server Sample)](../core/flatfilereceive-biztalk-server-sample.md). Demonstrates how to process delimited flat file messages into the equivalent XML messages using BizTalk Server pipelines.  
  
-   [EnvelopeProcessing (BizTalk Server Sample)](../core/envelopeprocessing-biztalk-server-sample.md). Demonstrates how to process flat file messages into XML messages with envelopes using BizTalk Server pipelines.  
  
-   [FlatFileSend (BizTalk Server Sample)](../core/flatfilesend-biztalk-server-sample.md). Demonstrates how to process XML messages into the equivalent positional flat file messages using BizTalk Server pipelines.
