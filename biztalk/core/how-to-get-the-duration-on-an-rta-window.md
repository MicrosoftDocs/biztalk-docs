# How to Get the Duration on an RTA Window
Administrators use the **get-rtawindow** command to get the duration for the specified real-time aggregation (RTA). The command returns the length of the duration and the units by which the duration is measured.  
  
### To get the duration on an aggregation  
  
1.  Open a command prompt as follows: Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **cmd**, and then click **OK**.  
  
2.  Navigate to the folder [!INCLUDE[btsBiztalkServerPath](../includes/btsbiztalkserverpath-md.md)]Tracking.  
  
3.  Type **bm get-rtawindow -View:\<view name\> -Activity:\<activity name\> -Rta:\<RTA name\>**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  On a system that supports User Account Control (UAC), you may need to run the tool with Administrative privileges.  
  
4.  Press **ENTER**.
