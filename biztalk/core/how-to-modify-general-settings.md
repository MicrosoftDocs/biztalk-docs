# How to Modify General Settings
Using the Settings Dashboard, you can modify the general configuration settings of a given host, across a BizTalk group. This topic provides the step-by-step procedure to perform this operation.  

## Prerequisites  
 To perform this operation, you must be logged on as a member of the BizTalk Server Administrators group.  

### To modify the general settings of a host  

1. In the **BizTalk Server Administration Console**, expand [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerAdminConsoleui](../includes/btsbiztalkserveradminconsoleui-md.md)], right-click **BizTalk Group**, and then click **Settings**.  

2. In the **BizTalk Settings Dashboard** dialog box, on the **Hosts** page, click the **General** tab.  

3. Do the following, and then click **Apply** to apply the modifications and proceed to another tab. Or click **OK** to apply the modifications and exit the Settings Dashboard.

   | **Default app-domain for isolated adapter** | Indicate whether the isolated adapter runs in the default app domain, or the domain of the caller.<br /><br /> By default all messaging engine objects are created in the domain of the caller. If the Web service is inactive for an extended period of time for any reason, IIS unloads the caller domain. When this happens, all services in the hosting process become unusable.<br /><br /> When you select the default AppDomain, the BizTalk Messaging Engine objects are created in the default AppDomain instead of in their own AppDomains. And, the default AppDomain is never unloaded.<br /><br /> This option is available only when you have created any of the host instances in the default AppDomain. |              On, Off              |      Off      |                                                     TRUE if any of the host instances for the host are set to this.

If the host contains orchestrations, no Message Agent output for the orchestration (XLANG) instances will display.<br /><br /> If the host only contains orchestrations, change the **Show performance counters for** setting to Orchestrations to display Message Agent counters for Orchestration instances. If the host only contains receive ports/send ports, keep the Messaging option to display Message Agent counters for Messaging instances.                                       |     Messaging, Orchestrations     |   Messaging   |                     If all host instances of a host have the same value, choose that value for the host.
