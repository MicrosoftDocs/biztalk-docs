## Explanation  
 This Information event indicates that the SSO service has failed to load the DLL.  

## User Action  
 To resolve this event, do one or more of the following:  

- Verify the DLL is located in the SSO installation directory, typically C:\Program Files\Common Files\Enterprise Single Sign-On. Your SSO installation directory may be different.  

- If the single DLL is missing or corrupted, attempt to replace it and then restart the service.
