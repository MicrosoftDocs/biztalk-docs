## Explanation  
 This Warning event indicates that the Password Sync notification retries have expired, and the notification has been discarded.  

 When a password change (from Windows to an external system) is delivered to a password sync adapter, the password sync adapter acknowledges that it has successfully processed the password change. If the password change does not occur within a specified amount of time, or if another problem occurs during the change, the password change is delivered to the password sync adapter again. This is done a limited number of times (max retries) and then the password change notification is discarded.  

## User Action  
 To resolve this warning, do the following:  

- Check System and Application event logs for associated events.
