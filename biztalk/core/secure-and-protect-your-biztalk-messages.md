# Secure and protect your BizTalk messages
Microsoft® BizTalk® Server provides a standard gateway for sending and receiving documents both within an intranet and through the Internet. Due to the possible business-critical nature of the messages sent to and from BizTalk Server, it is important to consider measures for securing these messages and the information they contain both as they are in transit and while BizTalk Server processes and stores them. This section provides information about the BizTalk Server security features, and how you can use them to secure your data and environment.  
  
 For more information about securing a BizTalk Server deployment, see [Designing the System Architectures for BizTalk Server](../core/designing-the-system-architectures-for-biztalk-server.md).
