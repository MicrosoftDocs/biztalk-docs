# How to Enable ASP.NET 4.0 for Published Web Services
Set the ASP.Net version in IIS.

The BizTalk Server Web Services Publishing Wizard relies on functionality provided with ASP.NET, which is included with the .NET Framework. The ASP.Net versions are included with the .NET CLR version you choose. 

This topic shows you how to change the .NET CLR version. 

## Prerequisites

IIS is included with the **Web Server (IIS)** role in the operating system. When you install this role, also select the newer version of ASP.NET. 
  
## Update an application pool

3.  Select the app pool, and open the **Basic Settings**.  
  
4. Set the **.NET CLR version** to the newer version, and select **OK** to save your changes.  

> [!NOTE]
> You can also change the version in the web.config file.
