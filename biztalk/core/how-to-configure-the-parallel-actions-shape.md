# How to Configure the Parallel Actions Shape
![](../core/media/ebiz-orch-paralactions.gif "ebiz_orch_paralactions")  
Parallel Actions shape  
  
> [!CAUTION]
>  If you place a **Terminate** shape inside a **Parallel Actions** shape, and the branch with the **Terminate** on it is run, the instance completes immediately, regardless of whether other branches have finished running. Depending on your design, results might be unpredictable in this case.  
  
## Synchronization of data access  
 It is possible that more than one branch of a **Parallel Actions** shape will attempt to access the same data. To avoid errors, place any shapes that access the data inside synchronized scopes. You can specify in the properties of a **Scope** shape that it is synchronized or not synchronized. For more information, see [Scopes](../core/scopes.md).  
  
#### To add a branch to a Parallel Actions shape  
  
1.  Right-click the **Parallel Actions** shape, and then click **New Parallel Branch**.  
  
     —Or—  
  
2.  Drag a new shape between two existing branches.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  To remove a branch from a **Parallel Actions** shape, right-click the branch you want to remove, and then click **Delete**.
