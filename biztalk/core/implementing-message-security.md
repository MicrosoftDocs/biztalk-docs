# Implementing Message Security
You can configure your Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] environment to use certificates for sending and receiving signed and encrypted messages. By using certificates for encryption and digital signatures, BizTalk Server can:  
  
-   Send and receive data that can be trusted.  
  
-   Make sure that the data it processes is secure.  
  
-   Make sure that authorized parties receive its messages.  
  
-   Make sure that it receives messages from authorized parties.  
  
 This section provides information about how to configure BizTalk Server pipelines, receive locations, ports, and the BizTalk Server environment to implement message security.  
  
 For more information about message security, see [Planning Message Security](../core/planning-message-security.md).
