# Validating a Schema (EDI)
You can validate an EDI schema at design time. To do so, you use the XML Tool extensions to [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] in the [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] environment. The validate-schema operation validates the schema based on EDI rules. You do not have to designate an input message instance to validate a schema.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 You must be logged on as a member of the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administrators group.  
  
### To validate a schema  
  
1. In [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)], open a project. To the project in Solution Explorer, add the message schema that you want to validate.  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   > 
   >  - The message schemas are located in the appropriate subfolder under the [!INCLUDE[btsBiztalkServerPath](../includes/btsbiztalkserverpath-md.md)]XSD_Schema\EDI folder.
   >  - You do not have to build the project to validate a schema.  
  
2. Right-click the schema in Solution Explorer, and then click **Validate Schema**.  
  
3. Verify that there is a message in the Output window indicating that the operation succeeded.
