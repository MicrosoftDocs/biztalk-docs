# Why Use the TPE?
Business processes such as ordering, invoicing, and inventory tracking are the fundamental actions of e-commerce. Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] enables knowledge workers to gather specific or aggregated real-time information about the state of a business process. For example, they can find out why a specific customer order was processed but not shipped, or how many units of a product were sold and shipped in the previous 48-hour period.  
  
 The TPE is a key component in the end-to-end business activity monitoring solution that Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] offers. The BAM Framework provides an easy, real-time, transaction-consistent way to monitor heterogeneous business applications, and present the data for SQL queries and aggregated reports by using online analytical processing (OLAP) technology. Knowledge workers can use this information to assess the current state of their business so that they can quickly respond to changes.
