# What Happens to Artifacts During Application Deployment
The topics in this section describe what happens to the artifacts associated with an application when you add and remove artifacts, export and import applications and artifacts, and install and uninstall applications. It covers subjects such as the following:

-   How artifacts are copied to and deleted from the local file system  
  
-   How artifacts (.NET assemblies and COM components) are added to or removed from the Windows Registry  
  
-   How artifacts (BizTalk assemblies and .NET assemblies) are installed or uninstalled in the global assembly cache  
  
-   How certificates are added to the local certificate store
