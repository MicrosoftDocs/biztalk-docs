-   How artifacts are copied to and deleted from the local file system  
  
-   How artifacts (.NET assemblies and COM components) are added to or removed from the Windows Registry  
  
-   How artifacts (BizTalk assemblies and .NET assemblies) are installed or uninstalled in the global assembly cache  
  
-   How certificates are added to the local certificate store
