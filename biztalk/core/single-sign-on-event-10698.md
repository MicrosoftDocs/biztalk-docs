## Explanation  
 This Information event indicates that SSO has deleted a replay and\or progress file.  

 Replay files are used by password sync when the ENTSSO server cannot contact the SSO database. A progress file indicates how far through SSO was able to read the replay file in-case contact with the SSO database is again lost.  

## User Action  

- No user action is necessary.
