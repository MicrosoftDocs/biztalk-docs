# Building and Running Orchestrations
After you have designed your orchestration, you can compile and run it to test it for completeness and correctness.  
  
 Once your orchestration has compiled without errors, you can deploy it in a test environment before making any necessary modifications and eventually deploying it to run in a production environment.
