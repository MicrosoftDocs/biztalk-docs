# How to Delete User Mappings
Use these commands to delete one or more user mappings, as specified in the XML file. The following is an example XML file.  
  
```  
<sso>  
<mapping>  
<windowsDomain>domain</windowsDomain>   
<windowsUserId>WindowsUserName</windowsUserId>   
<externalApplication>Application name1</externalApplication>   
<externalUserId>App1UserName</externalUserId>   
</mapping>  
<mapping>  
<windowsDomain>domain</windowsDomain>   
<windowsUserId>WindowsUserName</windowsUserId>   
<externalApplication>Application name2</externalApplication>   
<externalUserId>App2UserName</externalUserId>   
</mapping>  
</sso>  
```  
  
 If a user is not a member of the Application Users account, or does not exist in Active Directory, you should use this command to remove the user mapping from the SSO database.  
  
 If a user account is changed, you must use this command to remove the old user mapping, and then create a new user mapping for the new user account. For more information about creating a mapping, see [How to Create User Mappings](../core/how-to-create-user-mappings.md).  
  
### To delete user mappings using the administration utility  
  
1.  On the **Start** menu, click **Run**, and then type **cmd**.  
  
2.  At the command line, go to the Enterprise Single Sign-On installation directory. The default installation directory is \<*drive*\>:\Program Files\Common Files\Enterprise Single Sign-On.  
  
3.  Type **ssomanage –deletemappings *\<mappings file name\>***, where \<*mappings file name*\> is the name of the file that contains the user mapping(s) you want to delete.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  On a system that supports User Account Control (UAC), you may need to run the tool with Administrative privileges.  
  
### To delete a specific user mapping using the administration utility  
  
1.  On the **Start** menu, click **Run**, and then type **cmd**.  
  
2.  At the command line, go to the Enterprise Single Sign-On installation directory. The default installation directory is *\<drive*\>:\Program Files\Common Files\Enterprise Single Sign-On.  
  
3.  Type **ssomanage –deletemapping *\<domain\>*\\*\<username\>* *\<application name\>***, where *\<domain\>* is the Windows domain for the user account, *\<username\>* is the Windows user name, and \<*application name*\> is the specific application for which you want to remove the user mapping.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  On a system that supports User Account Control (UAC), you may need to run the tool with Administrative privileges.  
  
### To delete a user mapping using the client utility  
  
1.  On the **Start** menu, click **Run**, and then type **cmd**.  
  
2.  At the command line, go to the Enterprise Single Sign-On installation directory. The default installation directory is *\<drive*\>:\Program Files\Common Files\Enterprise Single Sign-On.  
  
3.  Type **ssoclient –deletemapping *\<application name\>***, where *\<application name\>* is the name of the affiliate application you want to remove the user mapping for.
