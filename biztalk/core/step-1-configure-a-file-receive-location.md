# Step 1: Configure a FILE Receive Location
In this topic, you configure a FILE receive location that consumes the dummy request message that you drop to a file folder to invoke the send port.  
  
> [!NOTE]

### To configure a FILE receive location  
  
1.  From BizTalk Server Administration Console, under the **BizTalk Application 1** node, right-click **Receive Ports**, point to **New**, and then click **One-way Receive Port**.
