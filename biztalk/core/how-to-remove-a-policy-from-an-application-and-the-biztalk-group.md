# How to Remove a Policy from an Application and the BizTalk Group
This topic describes how to use the BizTalk Server Administration console or the command-line to remove a policy from an application and the Rule Engine database for the BizTalk group.  
  
 Before removing a policy, bear in mind the following important points:  
  
-   You cannot remove a deployed policy. You must first undeploy the policy, as described in [How to Deploy or Undeploy a Policy](../core/how-to-deploy-or-undeploy-a-policy.md). Undeploying a policy makes it inactive so that it no longer functions in any application that uses it in the BizTalk group.  
  
-   Removing a policy deletes it from the Rule Engine database. If you want to use this policy again, you should export it to an .xml file before removing it. For instructions, see [How to Export a Policy](../core/how-to-export-a-policy.md).  
  
-   If the policy is used by other applications, it will no longer be in effect for the other applications. Verify that you no longer want to use the policy for any other applications that reference it before you remove it.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform the procedure in this topic, you must be logged on with an account that is a member of the BizTalk Server Administrators group. For more detailed information on permissions, see [Permissions Required for Deploying and Managing a BizTalk Application](../core/permissions-required-for-deploying-and-managing-a-biztalk-application.md).
