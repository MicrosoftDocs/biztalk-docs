# Managing Pipelines

## Overview
This section provides instructions on using the BizTalk Server Administration console to manage the pipelines in a BizTalk group. You can configure tracking for events and messages as well as configure pipeline properties for a specific send port or receive location.  
  
 Pipelines perform actions on incoming and outgoing messages, such as transforming them from a native format into XML, encrypting or unencrypting data, performing property promotion, and so on.  
  
 You cannot add a pipeline to an application individually; a pipeline is added to an application as follows:  
  
- When you add a BizTalk assembly containing a pipeline to the application, as described in [How to Add a BizTalk Assembly to an Application](../core/how-to-add-a-biztalk-assembly-to-an-application.md).  
  
- When you import an .msi file into an application that includes a BizTalk assembly containing a pipeline, as described in [How to Import a BizTalk Application](../core/how-to-import-a-biztalk-application.md).  
  
- When a developer deploys into an application an assembly containing a pipeline from Visual Studio, as described in [Deploying BizTalk Assemblies from Visual Studio into a BizTalk Application](../core/deploying-biztalk-assemblies-from-visual-studio-into-a-biztalk-application.md).  
  
  For background information about pipelines, see [Pipelines](../core/pipelines.md). For information about developing pipelines, see [Creating Pipelines Using Pipeline Designer](../core/creating-pipelines-using-pipeline-designer.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can use Microsoft Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Object Model to create and run scripts that automate administrative tasks. For information about using WMI, see the **WMI Class Reference** [!INCLUDE[ui-guidance-developers-reference](../includes/ui-guidance-developers-reference.md)].
