# RetractByType
The **RetractByType** function retracts all instances of a specified type in the working memory, whereas the **Retract**function retracts only specific items of a certain type. The following paragraphs describe how the **RetractByType** function works with entities of different types.  
  
## .NET Objects  
 All objects for a given class type are retracted from working memory. You simply drag the class from the .NET Classes fact pane into the **RetractByType** function.  
  
## TypedXmlDocument  
 All instances are retracted. This means that all **TypedXmlDocument**s with the same **DocumentType.Selector** are retracted. You should drag the appropriate node from the XML Schemas fact pane into the **RetractByType** function. Consistent with the **Retract** function, if you perform a **RetractByType** on the document root node, not only will all **TypedXmlDocuments** asserted with that **DocumentType** be retracted, but all child **TypedXmlDocuments** (**XmlNode**s in the tree hierarchy) associated with those parent **TypedXmlDocuments** will also be retracted.  
  
## TypedDataTable and DataConnection  
 **Retract** and **RetractByType** are equivalent for both **TypedDataTable** and **DataConnection**. Because **DataSetName.DataTableName** is a unique identifier for both types, there is only one instance in the engine at any point in time. As with **Retract**, you drag the table into the **RetractByType** function.
