# UninstallApp Command
Uninstalls a BizTalk application from the local computer and also removes the application from the list of programs in Add or Remove Programs in Control Panel. This command has the same effect as removing an application by using Add or Remove Programs. If multiple .msi files have been installed for this application, all of the items installed by all of the .msi files are uninstalled.  
  
 The application name that you specify for this command must match the name of the application as displayed in Add or Remove Programs. If you are unsure of the application name, you can use the **ListPackage** command to obtain it, as described in [ListPackage Command](../core/listpackage-command.md).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Although it is possible to uninstall an application by double-clicking the .msi file, doing this is not supported. This is because multiple .msi files can be installed for the same application, and using this method will not uninstall all of the items associated with the application.
