# Using SSO
You can use either the MMC Snap-in or the command line management utility (ssomanage) to manage the SSO system. This includes activities such as updating the SSO database, adding, deleting, and managing applications, and administering user mappings.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  On a system that supports User Account Control (UAC), you may need to run the SSO command line tools with Administrative privileges.  
  
 Only Single Sign-On Administrators can perform these tasks.
