# Creating Web Ports
Web ports are specially configured ports that you use to consume (call) Web services. A Web port can contain multiple operations that represent a mix of one-way (request only) and two-way (request-response) Web methods. Each operation in a Web port represents one method of a Web service.  
  
 You must add a Web reference before you can create a Web port.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You cannot delete, cut, copy, paste, or modify the configuration for Web port types and Web message types.
