|Message Text|The loop contains a leaf node. It can only contain other Loops or Segments|  
  
## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that the receive pipeline could not process the incoming interchange, because the interchange did not conform to the document schema. In this case, a loop contained a childless leaf node, whereas the schema specified that the loop could only contain other loops or segments.  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, have the sender of the interchange fix the loop so that it does not contain leaf nodes, and then resend the interchange.
