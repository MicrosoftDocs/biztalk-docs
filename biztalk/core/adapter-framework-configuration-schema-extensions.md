# Adapter Framework Configuration Schema Extensions
The BizTalk Adapter Framework supports the dynamic generation of user interfaces based on an XSD definition. The adapter supplies the required XSD and the Adapter Framework creates a property page that allows the user to enter values.  
  
 To create custom user interfaces, the Adapter Framework provides several extensions. To use these extensions, you must import the Adapter Framework schema (BizTalkAdapterFramework.xsd). By importing the schema, you can access and use the decorations and specialized types in the adapter configuration schema.  
  
 Use the decoration tags and built-in types discussed in this section to customize the property grid for an adapter.
