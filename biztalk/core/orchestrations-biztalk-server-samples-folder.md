# Orchestrations (BizTalk Server Samples Folder)
Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] includes several orchestration samples in its software development kit (SDK). This section provides detailed information about the functionality demonstrated by these orchestration samples, instructions for building and running the samples, and the results you can expect. The samples listed below are sorted by complexity, that is, HelloWorld is the most basic sample in the list. Samples later in the list might be based upon functionalities shown in samples earlier in the list.  
  
## In This Section  
  
-   [HelloWorld (BizTalk Server Sample)](../core/helloworld-biztalk-server-sample.md). Demonstrates how to process XML messages into related, but distinct, types of XML messages by using BizTalk orchestrations and maps.  
  
-   [MethodCall (BizTalk Server Sample)](../core/methodcall-biztalk-server-sample.md). Demonstrates how to call a .NET-based method from a BizTalk orchestration.  
  
-   [CallOrchestration (BizTalk Server Sample)](../core/callorchestration-biztalk-server-sample.md). Demonstrates how to call a BizTalk orchestration from another orchestration.  
  
-   [Compensation (BizTalk Server Sample)](../core/compensation-biztalk-server-sample.md). Demonstrates how to use the **Compensate** shape in an orchestration.  
  
-   [PartyResolution (BizTalk Server Sample)](../core/partyresolution-biztalk-server-sample.md). Demonstrates how to use BizTalk orchestrations with party resolution to route instance messages.  
  
-   [BPEL Import (BizTalk Server Sample)](../core/bpel-import-biztalk-server-sample.md). Demonstrates how to create an orchestration from a Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) description of a process and related artifacts.
