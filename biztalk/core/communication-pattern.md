# Communication Pattern
Each *port type* has a communication pattern. The communication pattern determines whether one-way or two-way (request-response) transmissions can take place on ports of the given type. For more information, see the **Port Configuration Wizard** [!INCLUDE[ui-guidance-developers-reference](../includes/ui-guidance-developers-reference.md)].
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Different ports of the same type will always have the same communication pattern, but not necessarily the same communication direction.
