# How to Show and Hide Property Schemas
This topic describes how to use the BizTalk Server Administration console to show and hide property schemas in the Schemas folder for an application. A property schema is a simple version of a BizTalk schema that plays a role in the process of copying promoted properties back and forth between the instance message and the message context. You might want to hide property schemas to simplify the schema view, so that you only see document schemas.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform the procedure in this topic, you must be logged on with an account that is a member of the BizTalk Server Administrators group or BizTalk Server Operators group. For more detailed information on permissions, see [Permissions Required for Deploying and Managing a BizTalk Application](../core/permissions-required-for-deploying-and-managing-a-biztalk-application.md).  
  
### To show or hide property schemas in the Schemas folder  
  
1. Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerStartMenuItemui](../includes/btsbiztalkserverstartmenuitemui-md.md)], and then click **BizTalk Server Administration**.  
  
2. In the console tree, expand **BizTalk Server Administration**, expand the BizTalk group containing the schemas folder in which you want to show or hide property schemas, and then expand the application containing the schemas folder.  
  
3. Right-click the **Schemas** folder, and click either **Hide Property Schemas** or **Show Property Schemas**.
