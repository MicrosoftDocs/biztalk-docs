# Guidelines for Resolving SQL Server Permissions Problems
[!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] makes extensive use of Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] databases for run-time operations and as such, it is important that the [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] permissions are set correctly. This topic provides some general guidelines for minimizing [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] permissions problems and steps that you can follow to troubleshoot [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] permissions problems that affect [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)].

## General Guidelines

- **Use domain users and groups for a multicomputer installation of BizTalk Server**

   You must use domain user groups and accounts when configuring [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] to run in a multicomputer scenario, for example, where [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] are installed on separate computers. Do not attempt to configure or run [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] in a *pass-through* authentication scenario whereby matching pairs of usernames and passwords are created on each computer to avoid using domain groups and accounts. While such a pass-through scenario may appear to function correctly in some scenarios, this will cause [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] to fail in other scenarios and is not a supported configuration.

   For more information about installing and configuring [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] in a multicomputer configuration, download the Installation Guide at [Installation Guides Related to BizTalk Server 2013](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=269582).

- **Ensure that the appropriate Windows users and groups are defined in the appropriate SQL Server roles**

   Verify correct [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] role membership as listed in the table in the topic [Windows Groups and User Accounts in BizTalk Server](../core/windows-groups-and-user-accounts-in-biztalk-server.md).

- **User SQL Server Profiler to diagnose permissions problems**

   Set up a [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] Profiler trace to monitor the **Audit Login Failed Event** to gather detailed information about permissions failures. For information about how to use [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] Profiler, see the [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] documentation.

## Known Issues

#### The SQL Server jobs that are installed with BizTalk Server fail to execute

##### Problem
 The SQL Server jobs that are installed with [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] fail and errors similar to the following are generated in the [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] Application log:

 Event Type: Warning

 Event Source: SQLSERVERAGENT

 Event Category: Job Engine

 Event ID: 208

 Date: 6/29/2008

 Time: 4:45:01 PM

 User: N/A

 Computer: *SQLServer*

 Description:

 SQL Server Scheduled Job 'Backup BizTalk Server'

 (0x4AC7C44A48541443927A56C5C6699ECF) - Status: Failed - Invoked on: 2008-6-29 13:45:01 - Message: The job failed.  The Job was invoked by Schedule 305 (MarkAndBackupLogSched). The last step to run was step 1 (BackupFull).

 **- and -**

 Event Type: Information

 Event Source: MSSQLSERVER

 Event Category: (4)

 Event ID: 17055

 Date: 6/29/2008

 Time: 4:45:01 PM

 User: N/A

 Computer: *SQLServer*

 Description:

 18456: Login failed for user 'NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM'.

##### Cause
 This error can occur if the BUILTIN\Administrators login has been removed from [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)]. If the BUILTIN\Administrators login is deleted, sqlmaint.exe will be unable to logon to [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] which will prevent SQL jobs from running.

##### Resolution
 To resolve this issue, re-create the BUILTIN\Administrators Login and add it to the db_owner role for the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] databases and the Master database.
