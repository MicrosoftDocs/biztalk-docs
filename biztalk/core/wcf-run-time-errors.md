## Explanation  
 This message provides a way for the WCF adapter to write an “informational” event log entry (the provided APIs for adapters allow the creation of warnings or errors, not information).  
  
## User Action  
 If you see this informational event in the event log, it indicates that the auto-recovery has succeeded. No further action in regard to this message is necessary.
