# How to Define Milestone Groups
Use a milestone group to put related milestones together, for example the beginning and end milestones that define how long a Purchase Order is valid. You can then use the milestone group as a single milestone.  
  
 Use the BAM View wizard to create new milestone groups. Before you can create milestones or milestone groups, use the BAM Activity wizard to create business activities, items, and business activity views. For more information about using the wizard, see [Defining Business Activities and Views in Excel](../core/defining-business-activities-and-views-in-excel.md).  
  
 Business activities and items are created through BAM Acitivity wizard, rather than BAM View wizard.  
  
### To define milestone groups  
  
1.  In the BAM View wizard, click **Next** until you see the second **Edit BAM View: View Items** page. Click **New Group**.  
  
2.  Type a Business milestone alias.  
  
3.  In the window below the alias box, click the milestones you want to include in the group, and then click **OK**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If you want all of your milestone activities in the group, click **Select all milestones**.  
  
4.  When you finish adding aliases, durations, and groups, click **Next** to continue to the aggregation page of the dialog.
