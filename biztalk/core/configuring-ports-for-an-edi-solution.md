# Configuring Ports for an EDI Solution
To receive and send EDI messages and acknowledgments, create the following receive and send ports:  
  
-   A one-way static FILE receive port that receives EDI interchanges and acknowledgments or a two-way request-response FILE receive port that receives EDI interchanges and sends acknowledgments.  
  
-   A one-way FILE send port that sends EDI interchanges or acknowledgments.
