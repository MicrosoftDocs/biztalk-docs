# MQSeries Adapter High Availability
You can improve availability in the following ways when you use the adapter:

- Set up a fault-tolerant hosting environment for [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)].

- Use Windows Clustering with IBM WebSphere MQ.

  For information about fault tolerance and [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], see [Sample BizTalk Server Architectures](../core/sample-biztalk-server-architectures.md) and [Planning Your Platform for Fault Tolerance](../core/planning-your-platform-for-fault-tolerance.md) in [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Help.

  To ensure that the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] MQSeries Adapter is able to communicate with a remote installation of the MQSAgent component, ensure that you have enabled network COM+ access on the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)]and server where IBM WebSphere MQ is installed. For more information about enabling network COM+ access, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article number 817065, " How to enable network COM+ access in Windows Server 2003," available at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=196580](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=196580).

  There is no requirement to cluster the MQSAgent (MQSAgent2) COM+ application that is used with the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] MQSeries adapter. To provide high availability for this component, install the component on each cluster node. If the COM+ application stops, the next call from the client will start it.
