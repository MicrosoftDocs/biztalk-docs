# Troubleshooting JD Edwards EnterpriseOne
This section describes common issues and error messages you might encounter in BizTalk Adapter for JD Edwards EnterpriseOne and provides possible corrections for them. In addition, it discusses the use of Event Tracing for Windows.  
  
 You can use the following debugging/tracing tools to troubleshoot the adapter:  
  
-   Native BizTalk Server debugging (for example, the Tracking Type on your port or the Orchestration Debugger).  
  
-   Error messages submitted to the Event Log.  
  
-   The capture of transmitter, receiver, and management messages through BTAJDEEnterpriseOneTrace.cmd and a tool that converts.etl files, such as tracerpt.exe or tracedmp.exe.
