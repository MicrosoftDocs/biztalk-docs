# Verifying the Deployment Setup
Before you use BizTalk Server to import a binding file, verify the following:  
  
-   The folders for the responses must exist and be identical on the new computer, or edit the binding file.  
  
-   TIBCO Enterprise Message Service system passwords, if present in the configuration, must be saved as ***** in the binding file. For more information, see [Deployment Limitations](../core/deployment-limitations1.md).
