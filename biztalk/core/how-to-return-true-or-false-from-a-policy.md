# How to Return True or False from a Policy
You cannot specify a return type for a policy directly. However, you can pass one of the following types of facts to the policy, have the policy change the value of the fact to `true` or `false`, and then check the value of the property/element/column after the policy is executed:  
  
-   A .NET object with a property of type `Boolean`  
  
-   An XML document with an element of type `Boolean`  
  
-   A database table with a column of type `Boolean`
