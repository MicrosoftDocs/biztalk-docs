|Message Text|A persistence exception has occured during the batch submission in the batching Orchestration. Batch Id = {0}, ErrorMessage = {1}. Please check your send port subscriptions and fix them.|  
  
## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that BizTalk Server could not send a batched interchange because no send port subscribed to the interchange.  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, ensure that a send port subscribes to the batch by setting the following filter properties for the send port: EDI.DestinationPartyName = \<PartyName\>, EDI.BatchEncodingType = EDIFACT or X12, and EDI.ToBeBatched = False.
