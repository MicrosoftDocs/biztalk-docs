# Information Worker Technologies
The Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)] engine provides support for automated business processes that span multiple applications.

They might need to monitor various business-related aspects of the process, for example, or work with trading partners in various ways.
