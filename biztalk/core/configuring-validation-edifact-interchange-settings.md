# Configuring Validation (EDIFACT-Interchange Settings)
This section provides instructions on how to prevent duplicate control numbers from being processed.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  No properties are disabled on this page even if you cleared the **Local BizTalk processes messages received by the party or supports sending messages from this party** check box while creating the party for which you are creating the agreement.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 You must be logged on as a member of the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administrators or [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] B2B Operators group.  
  
### To configure duplicate validation  
  
1. Create an EDIFACT encoding agreement as described in [Configuring General Settings (EDIFACT)](../core/configuring-general-settings-edifact.md). To update an existing agreement, right-click the agreement in the **Parties and Business Profiles** page, and click **Properties**.  
  
2. On a one-way agreement tab, under **Interchange Settings** section, click **Validation**.  
  
3. Select the **Interchange control number (UNB5)** check box to enable the receive pipeline to block duplicate interchanges. If selected, [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] will check that the interchange control number for the received interchange does not match the interchange control number of another received interchange. If a match is detected, the receive pipeline will not process the interchange.  
  
4. If **Interchange control number (UNB5)** is selected, in the **Check for duplicate UNB5 within** field, enter the number of days to check for a duplicate interchange.  
  
5. Select **Group control number (UNG5) in interchange** to prevent the receive pipeline from processing duplicate groups.  
  
6. Select **Transaction Set Control Number (UNH1) in group** to prevent the receive pipeline from processing duplicate transaction sets.  
  
7. Click **Apply** to accept the changes before continuing with the configuration, or click **OK** to validate the changes and then close the dialog box.
