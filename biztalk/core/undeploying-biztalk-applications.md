# Undeploying BizTalk Applications
You must undeploy a BizTalk application to remove it from your BizTalk group and host computers. This section describes the following tasks involved in undeploying an application:  
  
-   **Delete the BizTalk application.** This removes its data from the BizTalk databases for the BizTalk group. When you do this, the application no longer displays in the BizTalk Administration console.  
  
-   **Uninstall the BizTalk application.**  This removes the files and settings associated with the application and its artifacts from the local file system.  
  
-   **Removing other files and settings.** You may also need to remove certain other files and settings associated with the application.
