# Delimited Record Considerations
There are a number of considerations that you should keep in mind when working with delimited **Record** nodes within your schemas. This includes the considerations about the order of subordinate nodes relative to their delimiters, cases in which you can choose to omit delimiters when assembling the flat file representation of a message, and restrictions regarding the intermixing of delimited and positional records. This section provides information about these considerations.
