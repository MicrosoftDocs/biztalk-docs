# How to Open a Saved Query
You can open a saved query directly from the folder where the query is saved or from within the BizTalk Server Administration Console. When you open a query directly from a folder, it opens the appropriate BizTalk Server group in the Administration Console. When you open a query from within the Administration Console, you have the option of running the query on any of the groups listed.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure, you must be logged on as a member of the BizTalk Server Operators group.  
  
### To open a saved query from disk  
  
1.  Browse to the folder where the saved query is stored.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  By default, saved queries are stored in the **My Documents** folder of the user who created and saved them.  
  
2.  Double-click the saved query, which opens the BizTalk Server Administration Console and executes the query.  
  
### To open a saved query from the Administration Console  
  
1. Click **Start**, click **Programs**, click [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerStartMenuItemui](../includes/btsbiztalkserverstartmenuitemui-md.md)], and then click **BizTalk Server Administration**.  
  
2. In the console tree, expand [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerAdminConsoleui](../includes/btsbiztalkserveradminconsoleui-md.md)], and then click the BizTalk group.  
  
3. In the details pane, click the **New Query** tab, and then click **Open Query**.  
  
4. In the **Open** dialog box, browse to the saved query that you want to open, select that query, and then click **Open**.
