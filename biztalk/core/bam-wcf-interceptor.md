# BAM WCF Interceptor
The BAM WCF interceptor provides comprehensive support for tracking data within your WCF services.  
  
 You can use the BAM WCF interceptor to:  
  
-   Transparently deliver workflow application data to BAM without having to recompile your WCF application.  
  
-   Track information from both parameters and messages in WCF service calls.  
  
-   Track information from messages in WCF service calls.  
  
-   Participate in transactions flowed from the client or initiated internally by the WCF runtime for transacted service calls.
