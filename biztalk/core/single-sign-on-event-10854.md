## Explanation  
 The string format is incorrect for this function.  
  
## User Action  
 Proper formatting for password strings is described below:  
  
 VT_BSTR type property  
  
 The delimiter is / (slash)  
  
 dc = default case (no operation - do nothing)  
  
 Example: dc/  
  
 (no change - 'Cat' to 'Cat')  
  
 uc = upper case  
  
 Example: uc/  
  
 (change password to upper case - 'Cat' to 'CAT')  
  
 lc = lower case  
  
 Example: lc/  
  
 (change password to lower case - 'Cat' to 'cat')  
  
 rc = remove chars - followed by count followed by chars  
  
 Example: rc/2/#@/  
  
 (remove the characters '#' and '@' from the password - 'C@t#' to 'Ct')  
  
 sc = substitute chars - followed by count followed by chars to replace followed by substitute chars  
  
 Example: sc/3/abc/def/  
  
 (remove the characters 'a', 'b' and 'c' from the password and replace with 'd', 'e' and 'f' respectively)  
  
 ('Cat' to 'Cdt')  
  
 ps = pad from start - followed by count (min password length) followed by single pad char  
  
 Example: ps/8/#/  
  
 (if the password is not at least 8 chars in length then pad from the start with the character '#' until there are 8 chars total)  
  
 ('Cat' to '#####Cat')  
  
 pe = pad from end - followed by count (min password length) followed by single pad char  
  
 Example: pe/10/$/  
  
 (if the password is not at least 10 chars in length then pad to the end with the character '$' until there are 10 chars total)  
  
 ('Cat' to 'Cat$$$$$$$')  
  
 tr = truncate - limit length of string - followed by count  
  
 Example: tr/11/  
  
 ('Cat123456789' to 'Cat12345678');  
  
 The tokens are processed in their order in the string.  
  
 Example:  
  
 uc/rc/1/&/sc/2/#$/--/ps/8/&/tr/32/
