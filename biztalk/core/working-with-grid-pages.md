# Working with Grid Pages
Creating maps for many business documents can involve numerous links and functoids, often enough to make the grid complex and difficult to understand. The solution to this potential complexity is the introduction of pages to the grid. You can isolate different aspects of your mapping into different pages, and then view and work with those pages separately.  
  
 Pages are represented as tabs in the grid. You can add new pages, rename pages, delete pages, move between and within them, and so on. This section provides step-by-step instructions for these various page operations.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  For a list of shortcuts to work with grid pages, see [BizTalk Mapper Keyboard Shortcuts](../core/biztalk-mapper-keyboard-shortcuts.md).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Links and functoids connected to each other must all be in the same grid page. You can move links and functoids between grid pages.  We can perform **Move To Page** operation either by selecting any number of link(s) and/or functoids, or  selecting any number of items and dragging them to other pages. For more information, see [How to Move Between and Within Grid Pages](../core/how-to-move-between-and-within-grid-pages.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Grid properties apply to the entire grid and not to an individual page. Setting a Grid property establishes the value for all of the pages and not merely the page displayed.
