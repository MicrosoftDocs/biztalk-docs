# Configure automatic deployment with Visual Studio Team Services in BizTalk Server

## Overview

Using Azure DevOps, you can automatically deploy [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion_md](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] applications to different BizTalk environments. 

Typically, there are two roles involved:

- BizTalk developer creates the application, and builds it locally. Then, checks the application into Git or Team Foundation Version Control.
- Azure DevOps admin creates the build and release definitions, and deploys to the BizTalk application to different environments (Dev, UAT, Production).

If youâ€™ve never used Azure DevOps, this walkthrough may be challenging. It does require some understanding of git, including cloning, and pushing changes. 

We show you how to setup Azure DevOps with [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion_md](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], and add your first application to deploy. We recommend you refer to the [VSTS guidance](/vsts/user-guide/), as the Azure DevOps UI changes. 

## Before you begin

* Have Azure DevOps account ready. Don't have one? [Sign up for Visual Studio Team Services](https://www.visualstudio.com/docs/setup-admin/team-services/sign-up-for-visual-studio-team-services).
* If you already have a Azure DevOps Agent installed on your BizTalk computer, then the existing agent is overwritten with the latest Azure DevOps Agent. You may have to update your [VSTS service to align with the new agent](https://www.visualstudio.com/docs/build/actions/agents/v2-windows#replace-an-agent).

## Prerequisites

* Some experience and knowledge with creating and working with definitions in Azure DevOps. If you're brand new to Azure DevOps, these may be good resources:
