# Developing Custom Components
Custom components in BizTalk Server are developed and used to modify or extend certain infrastructure elements of BizTalk Server.  Primarily, this includes such things as:  send or receive adapter components which are based on the Adapter Framework and used to handle specific transport protocols; pipeline components used in any of the send or receive pipeline stages; and functoids used in maps.  You can extend [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] with custom code in several ways. The following topics describe how to do this.
