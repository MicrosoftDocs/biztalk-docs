# Using Schemas
This section contains code examples for common tasks associated with using schemas.  
  
## Using XSD schemas  
 The `IDocumentSpec Interface` interface represents a document shape defined by an XML Schema definition language (XSD) schema; the shape is rooted by a top-level element of the XSD. After the schema is installed, it can be retrieved by calling the `IPipelineContext.GetDocumentSpecByType Method` or `IPipelineContext.GetDocumentSpecByName Method` methods in the **IPipelineContext** interface.  
  
```  
IDocumentSpec docspec = pipeineContext.GetDocumentSpecByType("myschema#root");  
```  
  
## Using XSD flat file schemas  
 Both the **GetDocumentSpecByType** and **GetDocumentSpecByName** methods return the **IDocumentSpec** interface. If the schema is actually a flat file schema (one that has additional flat file-specific annotations), you can typecast the **IDocumentSpec** into **IFFDocumentSpec** and initiate parsing and serializing sequences from there.  
  
```  
IFFDocumentSpec docspec = (IFFDocumentSpec) pipeineContext.GetDocumentSpecByType("myschema#root");  
```
