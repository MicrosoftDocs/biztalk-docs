|  Message Text   | Max limit of acceptable Edifact interchange control number has reached for party {0}. Reset counter by navigating to Party in receiver role screen, field UNB 5 in Partner Agreement manager |
  
## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that the send pipeline could not process the outgoing interchange because the interchange control number in the UNB5 field specified in the party settings, specifically the reference number in field UNB5.2, was greater than the maximum allowable value. The maximum allowable value for the interchange control number depends upon the values of the three fields in UNB5. The maximum number of characters is 14 for the reference number in field UNB5.2, 13 for the prefix in UNB5.1 and 13 for the suffix in UNB5.3, and 14 for all three fields combined.  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, reset the reference number field (UNB5.2) of the interchange control number, as follows:  
  
1.  In the EDI Properties dialog box for the party resolved for the interchange, open the UNB Segment Definition page for the party as interchange receiver.  
  
2.  Click the Edit field associated with the UNB5 field.  
  
3.  Set the middle field of the interchange control number (the reference number in UNB5.2) to a new value such that the field has an acceptable number of digits.
