# Support for Nullable Types
The rule engine supports using nullable types in a business rule. You can use nullable types in .NET class bindings, XML bindings, and database bindings. Currently, the Business Rule Composer tool does not support using nullable types in a business rule. You can use the nullable types when creating rules programmatically.  
  
## Using Nullable Types in .NET Class Bindings  
 You can create a class member binding to a property or a field whose type is a nullable type. You can also create a class member binding to a method that takes a parameter of nullable type and/or returns a value of nullable type. The following sample code demonstrates how to access a nullable field, and how to access a return value of nullable type from a method in a business rule. If you execute a console application with the following code as it is, you will see that the value of the **prop** field is set to 5. If you do not initialize the **prop** field in the class or initialize it to null and run the code, you will see that the value of the **prop** field is set to 1.  
  
```  
using Microsoft.RuleEngine;  
namespace UseNullableAsm  
{  
    class Program  
    {  
        public class Class1  
        {  
            public int? prop = 1;  
            private int? prop2 = 4;  
            public int? GetProp2()  
            {  
                return prop2;  
            }  
        }  
  
        static void Main(string[] args)  
        {  
            //Create the class binding for the Class1 class  
            ClassBinding cbCls1 = new ClassBinding(typeof(Class1));  
  
            //Create the class member binding to the GetProp2 method of Cls1 class  
            ClassMemberBinding cmGetProp2 = new ClassMemberBinding("GetProp2", cbCls1);  
  
            //Create the class member binding to the to GET the value of prop  
            ClassMemberBinding cmGetProp = new ClassMemberBinding("prop", cbCls1);  
  
            //Create arguments for the prop1 field, which is prop1 + GetProp2()  
            UserFunction ufGetProp = new UserFunction(cmGetProp);  
            Add addArg = new Add(ufGetProp, new UserFunction(cmGetProp2));  
            ArgumentCollection al1 = new ArgumentCollection();  
            al1.Add(addArg);  
  
            //Set the value of prop to prop1 + cmGetPro2()  
            ClassMemberBinding cmProp = new ClassMemberBinding("prop", cbCls1, al1);  
  
            //Create a userfunction based on cmProp and add to the action collection  
            UserFunction ufProp = new UserFunction(cmProp);  
            ActionCollection ac = new ActionCollection();  
            ac.Add(ufProp);  
  
            //Create the condition list IF prop == 1  
            Equal eq = new Equal(ufGetProp, new Constant(1));  
  
            //Create the rule   
            // If (prop == 1)  
            // Then prop = prop + GetProp2()  
            Rule rl = new Rule("NullableTestRule", eq, ac);  
  
            //Create the condition list IF prop != 1  
            NotEqual neq = new NotEqual(ufGetProp, new Constant(1));  
  
            //Set the value of prop to prop to 1  
            Constant ct = new Constant(1);  
            ArgumentCollection al2 = new ArgumentCollection();  
            al2.Add(ct);  
  
            //Create class member binding to prop field with argument value 1  
            ClassMemberBinding cmSetProp = new ClassMemberBinding("prop", cbCls1, al2);  
  
            //Create a userfunction based on cmSetProp and add to the action collection  
            UserFunction ufSetProp = new UserFunction(cmSetProp);  
            ActionCollection ac2 = new ActionCollection();  
            ac2.Add(ufSetProp);  
  
            //Create the second rule   
            // If (prop != 1)  
            // Then prop = 1  
            Rule rl2 = new Rule("NullableTestRule2", neq, ac2);  
  
            //Create the policy and add both the rules to the policy  
            RuleSet rs = new RuleSet("NulableTestPolicy");  
            rs.Rules.Add(rl);  
            rs.Rules.Add(rl2);  
  
            //Create the .NET object fact  
            Class1 cls1Obj = new Class1();  
  
            //Print the value of the field prop before executing the policy  
            Console.WriteLine("Value of the prop field is " + cls1Obj.prop);  
  
            //Execute the policy  
            PolicyTester pt = new PolicyTester(rs);  
            pt.Execute(cls1Obj);  
  
            //Print the value of the field prop after executing the policy  
            Console.WriteLine("Value of the prop field is " + cls1Obj.prop);  
        }  
    }  
}  
```  
  
## Using Nullable Types in Database Bindings  
 You can also use nullable types in database bindings. The following sample code fragment shows you how to use a nullable type in database bindings.  
  
```  
DataColumnBinding dcBinding = new DataColumnBinding(“col”, typeof(int?), dbBinding);  
```  
  
 Suppose you have a rule with a condition that checks the value of a database column to see if equals 3. If the value of the column is null, the expression evaluates to false. It does not cause an exception.  
  
## Using Nullable Types in XML Bindings  
 Similarly, you can use nullable types in XML bindings. The following sample code fragment shows how to use a nullable type in XML bindings.  
  
```  
XMLDocumentFieldBinding xfb1 = new XMLDocumentFieldBinding(typeof(int?),"ID",xdb);  
```
