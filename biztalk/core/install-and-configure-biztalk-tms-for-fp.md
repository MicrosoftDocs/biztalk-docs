# Install and Configure BizTalk Server TMS for Office 365 adapters in BizTalk Server

## Overview

**Starting with BizTalk Server 2016 Feature Pack 3**, you can send and receive messages between BizTalk Server and Office 365 Outlook features. The following adapters are included in Feature Pack 3:

BizTalk Server TMS is a service that manages the Office 365 OAuth tokens used by BizTalk. It refreshes these tokens periodically, ensuring that the tokens always remain valid. It has a dependency on Enterprise Single Sign On service (ENT SSO), and must be installed on a computer that hosts the master secret server.
