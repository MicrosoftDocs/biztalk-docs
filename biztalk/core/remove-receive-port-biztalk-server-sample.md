# Remove Receive Port (BizTalk Server Sample)
The Remove Receive Port sample demonstrates how to remove one or more receive ports.  
  
> [!WARNING]
>  Deployment scripts should be removed after deployment if not needed. Administration scripts and other scripts that must remain should be secured by ACLâ€™s and closely monitored.  
  
## What This Sample Does  
 The Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript) script in the script file that constitutes this sample shows how to perform the following operations using the BizTalk Server WMI provider:  
  
-   Given a receive port name, query for a list of matching receive ports.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Generally, there will only be one receive port that matches a given name.  
  
-   Remove those receive ports.  
  
-   Handle any errors such that meaningful information is returned to the user.

     \<*Samples Path*\>\Admin\WMI\Remove Receive Port\VBScript\  
  
2.  Run the file RemoveReceivePort.vbs using the cscript program, passing the following command-line argument:  
  
     **\<**
     ***ReceivePortName* \>**. The name of the receive port(s) to remove. If the receive port name contains spaces, enclose the name in quotes.
