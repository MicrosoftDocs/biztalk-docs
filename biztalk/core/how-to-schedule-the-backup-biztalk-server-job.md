# How to Schedule the Backup BizTalk Server Job
The Backup [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] job runs as scheduled by the SQL Server Agent service. If you want to create more frequent or less frequent backups, you can change the schedule of the Backup [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] job by using SQL Server Management Studio.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 You must be logged on with an account that is a member of the SQL Server sysadmin fixed server role to perform this procedure.  
  
### To schedule the Backup BizTalk Server job (SQL Server 2008)  
  
1.  On the computer that contains the BizTalk Management database, click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2**, and then click **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio**.  
  
2.  In the **Connect to Server** dialog box, specify the name of the SQL Server where the BizTalk Server databases reside and the appropriate authentication type, and then click **Connect**.  
  
3.  In the Object Explorer, double-click **SQL Server Agent**, and then click **Jobs**.  
  
4.  In the details pane, right-click **Backup BizTalk Server (BizTalkMgmtDb)**, and then click **Properties**.  
  
5.  In the **Job Properties - Backup BizTalk Server (BizTalkMgmtDb)** dialog box, under **Select a page**, click **Steps**.  
  
6.  In the **Job step list**, click **BackupFull**, and then click **Edit**.  
  
7.  In the **Job Step Properties - BackupFull** dialog box, in the **Command** box, edit the command by changing the frequency to the desired interval at which to perform a full backup: **'h'** (hourly), **'d'** (daily), **'w'** (weekly), **'m'** (monthly), **'y'** (yearly), and then click **OK**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  The first time the Backup BizTalk Server job is run during a new period, a full backup is performed.  
  
8.  In the **Job Properties - Backup BizTalk Server (BizTalkMgmtDb)** dialog box, under **Select a page**, click **Schedules**.  
  
9. In the **Schedule list**, click **MarkAndBackupLogSched**, and then click **Edit**.  
  
10. In the **Job Schedule Properties - MarkAndBackupLogSched** dialog box, in Schedule type, select **Recurring** from the drop-down list box (if it is not already selected).  
  
     By default, the job is scheduled to run every 15 minutes.  
  
11. Update the schedule as desired, and then click **OK**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
