## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that a custom document schema is invalid because the headers and trailers were not in the correct order. BizTalk Server performs this validation when the schema is deployed.  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, change the customized document schema so that the headers and trailers are in the correct order, and then redeploy the schema.
