# Using the Microsoft BizTalk LoadGen 2007 Tool
The Microsoft BizTalk LoadGen 2007 Tool is intended for developers and IT professionals to simulate load on a BizTalk Server. Using this tool, you can simulate load to instrument performance and stress against a BizTalk deployment. In addition, this tool may also be extended by developers to simulate load for custom transports.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The LoadGen 2007 tool is available for download at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=59841](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=59841). The previous version of this tool, the BizTalk Server 2004 Load Generation Tool is available for download at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=108999](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=108999).  
  
 This tool should be used in a test environment only, and should not be used in a production environment. This tool is provided "as-is" and is not supported.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can use BizTalk Server 2004 Load Generation Tool with the MSMQ adapter, but you must do some additional steps. For instructions, see [Using LoadGen 2007 with MSMQ](../core/using-loadgen-2007-with-msmq.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  LoadGen is not supported on 64-bit computers. You can use LoadGen remotely running on a 32-bit computer to generate load against a 64-bit server.
