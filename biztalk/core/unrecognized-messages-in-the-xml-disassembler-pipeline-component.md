# Unrecognized Messages in the XML Disassembler Pipeline Component
The XML Disassembler component may handle a message as "unrecognized" in the following cases:  
  
- An XML message is received with no body, an empty body, or empty data in the body.  
  
- An XML message is received but no schema is deployed for it.  
  
  An unrecognized message is handled based on the **Allow Unrecognized Messages** property (or on the **XMLNorm.AllowUnrecognizedMessage** property on the message context).  
  
  If **Allow Unrecognized Messages** is set to **True**, the following occurs:  
  
- A message with no body, an empty/null body, or with empty/null data in the body passes unchanged through the XML Disassembler.  
  
- An XML document with no associated deployed schema passes unchanged through the XML Disassembler.  
  
- An XML document that has a deployed schema associated with it is processed by the XML Disassembler regardless of whether the schema is explicitly referenced in a component property or found during the schema resolution process.  
  
  If **Allow Unrecognized Messages** is set to **False**, the following occurs:  
  
- A message with no body or an empty/null body or with empty/null data in the body is not passed through the XML Disassembler.  
  
- An XML document that does not have a deployed schema associated with it is not passed through the disassembler. An error is reported and the message is suspended, if possible.  
  
- An XML document that has a deployed schema associated with it is processed by the XML Disassembler regardless of whether the schema is explicitly referenced in a component property or found during the schema resolution process.  
  
  By default, the XML Disassembler does not allow unrecognized messages.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Non-XML messages are not processed by the XML Disassembler regardless of the **Allow Unrecognized Messages** property setting.
