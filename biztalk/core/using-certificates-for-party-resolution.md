# Using Certificates for Party Resolution
A *party* is an entity outside BizTalk Server that interacts with an orchestration. When BizTalk Server receives a message, it uses the public key certificate to determine who sent the message, and to resolve the sender to a known party in the BizTalk Server environment.  
  
 This section provides information about how to configure [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] pipelines, receive locations, ports, and the BizTalk Server environment for party resolution.  
  
 For more information about authentication of a message, see [Authenticating the Sender of a Message](../core/authenticating-the-sender-of-a-message.md).
