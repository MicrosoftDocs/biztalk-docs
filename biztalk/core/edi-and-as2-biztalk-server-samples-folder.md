# EDI and AS2 (BizTalk Server Samples Folder)
Microsoft BizTalk Server includes the following EDI and AS2 samples in its software development kit (SDK). This section provides detailed information about the functionality demonstrated by the EDI samples, instructions for building and running the samples, and the results you can expect.  
  
## In This Section  
  
-   [AS2 over File (BizTalk Server Sample)](../core/as2-over-file-biztalk-server-sample.md). Demonstrates how to receive an AS2 message over a FILE receive location.  
  
-   [Message Enrichment Sample (BizTalk Server Sample)](../core/message-enrichment-sample-biztalk-server-sample.md). Demonstrates how to append interchange headers to transaction set messages for EDI documents.  
  
## Additional Sample Code  
  
-   [Sending an AS2 Message over a FILE Send Port](../core/sending-an-as2-message-over-a-file-send-port.md). This topic describes how to write headers to an AS2 message and how to promote AS2 header context properties.  
  
-   [Writing AS2 Context Properties for Outbound Party Resolution](../core/writing-as2-context-properties-for-outbound-party-resolution.md). This topic describes how to write the AS2To property or the UserHttpHeaders property (with the AS2 property) to the context so you can perform outbound AS2 party resolution.
