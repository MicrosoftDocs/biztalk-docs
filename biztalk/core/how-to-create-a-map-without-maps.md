# How to Create a Map without Maps
If you have XSLT code you have been using to convert instance messages, you can use that code directly instead of creating a map.  
  
 Using your XSLT code involves creating an empty map and setting its **Custom XSLT Path** grid property. If your XSLT code uses external .NET assemblies, you also need to create a custom extension XML file. For information about the structure of a custom extension XML file, see the **Custom Extension XML (Grid Property)** [!INCLUDE[ui-guidance-developers-reference](../includes/ui-guidance-developers-reference.md)].
  
## Use custom XSLT code in place of a map  
  
1.  Create an empty BizTalk map in your project and set the source and destination schemas.  
  
     For information about creating the map and setting the schemas, see [Creating Maps](../core/creating-maps.md).  
  
2.  In the Grid view, click the mapper grid.  
  
     The Properties window shows the **Grid** properties.  
  
3.  In the Properties window, select **Custom XSLT Path** and click the ellipsis (**â€¦**) button.  
  
4.  In the **Open** dialog box, navigate to the file and click **Open**.  
  
     The **Custom XSLT Path** property is set.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  BizTalk Mapper supports XSLT 1.0 only. Using XSLT 2.0 in BizTalk Mapper is not supported.
