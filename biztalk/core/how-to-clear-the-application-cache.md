# How to Clear the Application Cache
You can use the MMC Snap-In or the command line to remove the contents of the credential cache (all the information associated with the affiliate application) for the specified application on all of the Single Sign-On Servers.  
  
### To clear the cache using the MMC Snap-In  
  
1.  On the **Start** menu, click **All Programs**, click **Microsoft Enterprise Single Sign-On**, and then click **SSO Administration**.  
  
2.  In the scope pane of the ENTSSO MMC Snap-In, expand the **Enterprise Single Sign-On** node.  
  
3.  Click **Affiliate Applications**.  
  
4.  In the results pane, right-click the affiliate application, and click **Clear**.  
  
### To clear the cache using the command line  
  
1. On the **Start** menu, click **Run**, and then type **cmd**.  
  
2. At the command line, go to the Enterprise Single Sign-On installation directory. The default installation directory is \<*drive*\>:\Program Files\Common Files\Enterprise Single Sign-On.  
  
3. Type <strong>ssomanage â€“purgecache *\<application name\></strong><em>, where \<</em>application name*\> is the name of the affiliate application you want to purge the cache for.  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   >  On a system that supports User Account Control (UAC), you may need to run the tool with Administrative privileges.
