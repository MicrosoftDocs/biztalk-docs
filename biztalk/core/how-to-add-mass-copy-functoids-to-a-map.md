# How to Add Mass Copy Functoids to a Map
The **Mass Copy** functoid enables your maps to use schemas that include **any** and **anyAttribute** elements. These elements are, in essence, wildcards provided in the XML Schema definition language to match unknown structures or sets of attributes.  
  
 For conceptual information about the **Mass Copy** functoid, see [Mass Copy Functoid](../core/mass-copy-functoid.md).  
  
### To add the Mass Copy functoid to a map and configure it  
  
1. With the [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] Toolbox active, click the **Advanced Functoids** tab to select that category of functoids.  
  
    The list of advanced functoids in the chosen category appears.  
  
2. Drag the **Mass Copy** functoid (![Image that represents the Mass Copy functoid.](../core/media/advmasscopy.gif "advmasscopy")) from the Toolbox to the appropriate location on a grid page.  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   >  The functoid will be placed on the displayed grid page. If you want to put the functoid onto a different grid page, you need to display that other grid page first.  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   >  If you are constructing a map using more than one functoid together, you need to consider their relative left to right placement. Functoids are executed from left to right. The output of a functoid can only be input to another functoid that is farther to the right.  
  
3. To establish the input parameter for the **Mass Copy** functoid, create an input link by dragging a record from the source schema to the **Mass Copy** functoid, or dragging the **Mass Copy** functoid to a record in the source schema.  
  
4. To use the output parameter from the **Mass Copy** functoid, create an output link by dragging the **Mass Copy** functoid to a record in the destination schema, or by dragging a record in the destination schema to the **Mass Copy** functoid.  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   >  Unlike other functoids, you cannot use the output of the **Mass Copy** functoid as input to another functoid.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can insert and configure the **Mass Copy** functoid by linking two records directly. For more information, see the section “To link using a mass copy functoid” in [How to Link Records Automatically](../core/how-to-link-records-automatically.md).
