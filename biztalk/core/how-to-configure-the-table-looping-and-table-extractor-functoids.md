# How to Configure the Table Looping and Table Extractor Functoids
Step-by-step instructions for configuring the **Table Looping Grid** property of a **Table Looping** functoid are provided as steps 9 and 10 of [How to Add Table Looping and Table Extractor Functoids to a Map](../core/how-to-add-table-looping-and-table-extractor-functoids-to-a-map.md). Steps 3 through 8 are also relevant with respect to configuring the table grid because they must be performed first to populate the drop-down lists available in each cell of the table grid.
