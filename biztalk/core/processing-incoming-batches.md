# Processing Incoming Batches
When [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] receives a batched EDI interchange, it can either split the interchange into its transaction sets, processing each one separately, or it can preserve the interchange, processing all transaction sets as a group.  
  
 You determine batch processing in the **Local Host Settings** page of the one-way agreement tabs in the **Agreement Properties** dialog box for both X12 and EDIFACT agreements. When you preserve the interchange, you have the choice to suspend either the interchange or the transaction sets if an error occurs.
