## Explanation  
 This error indicates that a published isolated WCF receive location could not find the corresponding receive location.  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, do the following: In the BizTalk Administration console, make sure that the receive location specified by the receiveLocationName attribute in the Web.config file that the BizTalk WCF Publishing Wizard generated exists and is started.
