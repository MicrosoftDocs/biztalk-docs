# Tracking Profile Editor
This section describes the Tracking Profile Editor (TPE). The TPE is a tool that developers use to create or modify maps, known as tracking profiles, between items in a BAM activity and the BizTalk solution sources for those items. The TPE consists of a graphical user interface that allows developers to map a specific view of internal business processes, as well as associated data, to orchestrations and ports.  
  
 Once the business user has defined the activity, the developer connects the activity to an implementation source such as a BizTalk orchestration. The TPE facilitates the connecting of the implementation by providing a drag and drop experience that does not require the developer to provide code.  
  
 For information about using the keyboard shortcuts for TPE, see [TPE Keyboard Shortcuts](../core/tpe-keyboard-shortcuts.md).
