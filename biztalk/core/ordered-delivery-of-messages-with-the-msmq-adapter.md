# Ordered Delivery of Messages with the MSMQ Adapter
[!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] provides an **Ordered Delivery** option for static send ports. Setting the **Ordered Delivery** option on a send port to **True** ensures that BizTalk Server delivers messages to the send port in the same order that they are published to the MessageBox database. To provide end-to-end ordered delivery the following conditions must be met:  
  
-   Messages must be received with an adapter that preserves the order of the messages when submitting them to BizTalk Server.  
  
-   You must subscribe to these messages with a send port that has the **Ordered Delivery** option to **True**.  
  
-   If an orchestration is used to process the messages, only a single instance of the orchestration should be used, the orchestration should be configured to use a sequential convoy, and the **Ordered Delivery** property of the orchestration's receive port should be set to **True**.  
  
## Using the MSMQ Adapter for Ordered Delivery of Messages  
 The MSMQ receive adapter provides support for preserving the order of messages when submitting them to BizTalk Server. End-to-end ordered delivery of messages through BizTalk Server can be achieved when receiving messages with the MSMQ adapter if the messages are processed by a send port that is configured with the **Ordered Delivery** option set to **True**.
