# Scientific Functoids

## Overview
**Scientific** functoids are used to perform a variety of standard trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential calculations.  

 With the exception of the **Base-Specified Logarithm** and **X^Y** functoids, which each take two input parameters, the **Scientific** functoids all take a single parameter.  

 The four trigonometric **Scientific** functoids (**Arc Tangent**, **Cosine**, **Sine**, and **Tangent**) all use radians rather than degrees as the units for their relevant input or output parameters. A radian is a unit of measure of angles, such that there are 2π radians in a circle. It follows that:  

- 2π radians equals 360 degrees  

- 1 radian = 180/π degrees  

- 1 degree = π/180 radians  

  If your input or output instance messages use degrees as their unit of measure for angles, you will need to use a **Mathematical** functoid in conjunction with a trigonometric **Scientific** functoid to achieve the correct result.  

## Available functoids  
 The **Scientific** functoids are: 

* 10^n
* Arc Tangent
* Base-Specified Logarithm
* Common Logarithm
* Cosine
* Natural Exponential Function
* Natural Logarithm
* Sine
* Tangent
* X^Y
