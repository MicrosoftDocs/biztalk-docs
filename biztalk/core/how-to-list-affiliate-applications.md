### To list affiliate applications using the administration utility

2.  At the command line, go to the Enterprise Single Sign-On installation directory. The default installation directory is \<*drive*\>:\Program Files\Common Files\Enterprise Single Sign-On.  
  
3.  Type **ssomanage -listapps [all]** where **all** is an optional parameter that will also display applications using the Configuration Store feature.
