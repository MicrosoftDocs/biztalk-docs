# How to List Affiliate Applications
Use this command to list all the affiliate applications. If the user is a member of the Application Administrators account, this command will only display the application for which the user is an administrator.  
  
### To list affiliate applications using the administration utility  
  
1.  On the **Start** menu, click **Run**, and then type **cmd**.  
  
2.  At the command line, go to the Enterprise Single Sign-On installation directory. The default installation directory is \<*drive*\>:\Program Files\Common Files\Enterprise Single Sign-On.  
  
3.  Type **ssomanage -listapps [all]** where **all** is an optional parameter that will also display applications using the Configuration Store feature. If the user running this command is an Application administrator, it will only list the applications for which they are an administrator. If the user running this command is an Affiliate Administrator or an SSO Administrator, it will list all the affiliate applications.
