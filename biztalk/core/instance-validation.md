# Instance Validation
BizTalk Editor invokes the **IInstanceValidator.ValidateInstance** method of an extension when the following conditions are met:  
  
- The extension is set as standard by using the **Standard** property of the **Schema** node.  
  
- On the **Property Pages** dialog box associated with the schema, the **Generate Instance Output Type** property is set to **Native.**  
  
- On the **Property Pages** dialog box associated with the schema, the **Input Instance Filename** property is set to the name of a file containing the instance message to be validated.  
  
  The file specified in the **Input Instance Filename** property is passed as a parameter to the **IInstanceValidator.ValidateInstance** method.  
  
  If errors occur, error messages are returned as an array of **IValidationInfo** objects, and are displayed in the [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] Task List window.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If the schema contains pattern statements, and the file passed to the **ValidateInstance** method was generated by using the corresponding **Generate Instance** command, the instance message may not pass validation.
