# How to Delete a Send Port Group
This topic describes how use the BizTalk Server Administration console to delete a send port group from a BizTalk application. When you do this, the send port group is also deleted from the BizTalk Management database for the group. Deleting a send port group does not delete any send ports that it contains.  
  
 You can delete a send port group only if it meets the following conditions:  
  
-   An orchestration is not bound to the send port group. If this is the case, you can remove the binding by following the instructions in [How to Unbind an Orchestration](../core/how-to-unbind-an-orchestration.md).  
  
-   The send port group is both stopped and unenlisted. For instructions on stopping and unenlisting a send port, see [How to Unenlist a Send Port or Send Port Group](../core/how-to-unenlist-a-send-port-or-send-port-group.md) and [How to Stop a Send Port or Send Port Group](../core/how-to-stop-a-send-port-or-send-port-group.md).  
  
-   The send port group is not referenced by a party. For instructions on removing a reference to a send port group from a party, see [How to View or Edit a Party](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/42e6f3a0-8f7d-4f6c-ab05-a1fab7bf46ca).
