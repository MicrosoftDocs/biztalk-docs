# How to Save a Query
You can save a query for later reuse. By default, saved queries are stored in the **My Documents** folder of the user who created and saved them.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure, you must be logged on as a member of the BizTalk Server Operators group.  
  
### To save a query  
  
1. Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerStartMenuItemui](../includes/btsbiztalkserverstartmenuitemui-md.md)], and then click **BizTalk Server Administration**.  
  
2. In the console tree, expand [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerAdminConsoleui](../includes/btsbiztalkserveradminconsoleui-md.md)], and then click the BizTalk group.  
  
3. In the details pane, click the **New Query** tab.  
  
4. Create a query as desired, and then click **Save As**.  
  
5. In the **Save As** dialog box, browse to or create the folder where you want to save the query.  
  
6. In **File name**, type a name for the query, and then click **Save**.
