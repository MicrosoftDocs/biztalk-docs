# ExportApp Command
Exports a BizTalk application to an .msi file. If an .msi file having the same file name and path already exists, the existing .msi file is overwritten.  
  
 You can use the ResourceSpec parameter to selectively export the artifacts in an application to an .msi file. You specify which artifacts to export by editing the XML file created when you run the **ListApp** command with the ResourceSpec parameter, as described in [ListApp Command](../core/listapp-command.md). You then use the location of this XML file as the value of ResourceSpec when running the **ExportApp** command. When you do this, only the artifacts listed in the specified XML file are exported to the .msi file.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  For security reasons, during application export, passwords are removed from application bindings. They are not removed from any binding files that have been added to the application. After installing the application from the .msi file, you must reconfigure the passwords in order for the application to function.  
>   
>  In addition, private keys are removed from certificate files.
