# Performance Considerations for BAM Event Publishing
BAM supports two forms of business event publishing:  
  
-   Synchronous  
  
-   Asynchronous  
  
 The following diagram illustrates the two models.

 The synchronous approach is much simpler for management and using from code, while the asynchronous approach allows for better performance.
