# Performance Considerations for BAM Event Publishing
BAM supports two forms of business event publishing:  
  
- Synchronous  
  
- Asynchronous  
  
  The following diagram illustrates the two models.

  The synchronous approach is much simpler for management and using from code, while the asynchronous approach allows for better performance.
