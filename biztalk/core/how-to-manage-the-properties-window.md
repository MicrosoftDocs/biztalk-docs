# How to Manage the Properties Window
BizTalk Editor uses the Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] Properties window to display the values of the properties associated with nodes in the schema tree view, and provides an interface for changing those values. This topic provides step-by-step instructions for managing certain characteristics of the Properties window.  
  
### To turn property descriptions on and off  
  
-   In the Properties window, right-click any property name, and then click **Descriptions**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Use this procedure to toggle the display of properties on and off.  
  
### To arrange properties alphabetically within their categories  
  
-   Click the **Categorized** toolbar button above the list of properties in the Properties window.  
  
### To arrange properties alphabetically without regard to their categories  
  
-   Click the **Alphabetic** toolbar button above the list of properties in the Properties window.
