# Deploying and Managing BizTalk Applications
This section provides information about managing BizTalk applications, including how to deploy, modify, update, and undeploy them. BizTalk applications provide a way to view and manage the items, called "artifacts," that make up a BizTalk business solution. Examples of artifacts are BizTalk assemblies, .NET assemblies, schemas, maps, bindings, and certificates.  
  
 You can create a BizTalk application and add artifacts to it. You can then view, package, deploy, and manage the application and its artifacts as a single entity from within the BizTalk Administration console or by using the BTSTask command-line tool.  
  
 For background information about BizTalk application deployment and maintenance, see [Understanding BizTalk Application Deployment and Management](../core/understanding-biztalk-application-deployment-and-management.md). For step-by-step instructions on deploying a simple application, which will familiarize you with the application deployment features of [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], see [Walkthrough: Deploying a Basic BizTalk Application](../core/walkthrough-deploying-a-basic-biztalk-application.md).
