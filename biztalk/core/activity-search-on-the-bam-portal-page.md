# Activity Search on the BAM Portal Page
Business end users, developers, and business analysts can use the BAM portal page when they need to perform searches against BAM data to find specific cases of a particular process. These processes are defined as BAM activities. A BAM activity represents a unit of work in a business, such as a purchase order or loan application.  
  
## How an activity search works  
 An activity search allows you to perform searches against BAM data to find activities that match criteria you specify based on tracked values and items available in a BAM view, and to display the activities so that you can edit them or create alerts based on them.  
  
 Queries that you create for your searches can be saved and reused. You can also use them as the basis for an alert, for example, "Notify me any time a purchase order arrives from the specified customer." You use the buttons at the top of the content page to save, open, and run queries, as well as to set alerts.  
  
 Activity searches allow you to locate the activities that you want to monitor. Once you create an activity search, you can use that search to create an alert that will notify you of events that are of interest.  
  
## The Activity Search page  
 The Activity Search page is divided into three main sections inside the Content frame:  
  
- **Query**: This section allows users to search for activities by building search clauses based on specific tracked data items. The user can add and remove clauses as required.  
  
- **Column Chooser**: This section allows users to specify which items of data, from those available in that view, to return if any records match the search criteria.  
  
- **Results**: Results of the query display in this section.
