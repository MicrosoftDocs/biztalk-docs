|Message Text|Unable to get binding type for binding extension "{0}". If machine.config was updated while your application was open, restart your application to pick up changes. Verify the binding extension is registered in machine.config|  
  
## Explanation  
 A custom binding extension for a WCF-Custom or a WCF-CustomIsolated transport was not configured properly.  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error do one or more of the following:  
  
-   Ensure the **machine.config file** in **%WinDir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\Config** has the \<**bindingExtensions**\> element configured properly.  
  
-   In Windows Explorer, go to **%WinDir%\Assembly**, and make sure the assemblies implementing the custom binding extension are installed properly.  
  
-   For the WCF-Custom adapter, in the BizTalk Administration console, restart the host instance running the WCF transport.  
  
-   For the WCF-CustomIsolated adapter, in the IIS Management console, restart the application pool hosting the WCF transport.  
  
-   Open and close the BizTalk Administration console if it was opened
