# Accessing SOAP Headers in WCF Messages with Orchestrations
To access the SOAP header values of incoming WCF messages in orchestrations, you use the context property **WCF.InboundHeaders**. The WCF adapters copy custom SOAP headers and standard SOAP headers in the inbound messages to the **WCF.InboundHeaders** property. The WCF adapters also allow you to select the properties you would like to promote or write to the context properties programmatically. See [SOAP Headers with Published WCF Services](../core/soap-headers-with-published-wcf-services.md) for more details.  
  
 The value contained in the context property is a string containing XML data with the \<**headers**\> root element, and the incoming SOAP headers are copied as child elements of the \<**headers**\> element. The simplest way to access this data is to use the BizTalk Expression Editor in a **Message Assignment** or **Expression** shape, load the string in an **XmlDocument**, and use XPath queries to access specific fields. For more information about creating XML documents in the BizTalk Expression Editor, see [XLANG-s Language](../core/xlang-s-language.md).  
  
 The following code example gets the request SOAP header in a **Message Assignment** or **Expression** shape for the **WCF.InboundHeaders** property:  
  
```  
stringVar = inboundMessageInstance(WCF.InboundHeaders);  
```  
  
 Context properties are associated with a particular message. The Messaging Engine does not automatically map the values of the SOAP headers from the request message to the response message. When creating the response message for a WCF service, you must specifically set the SOAP header values through the **WCF.OutboundCustomHeaders** property. The following command is the simplest method of setting a SOAP header context property:  
  
```  
outboundMessageInstance(WCF.OutbounCustomHeaders) = "<headers><Origination xmlns=\"http://SOAPHeaderSchemas.OrigDestSOAPHeader\">Home</Origination><Destination xmlns=\"http://SOAPHeaderSchemas.OrigDestSOAPHeader\">Work</Destination></headers>"  
```  
  
 You can also set the context property by creating an **XmlDocument** and writing the string value of the **XmlDocument** to the context property.  
  
 For more information about how to access SOAP headers with the WCF adapters, see the SDK sample "Using Custom SOAP Headers with the WCF Adapters" at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=79960](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=79960).
