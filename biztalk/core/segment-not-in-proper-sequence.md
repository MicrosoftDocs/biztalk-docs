## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that the receive pipeline could not process the incoming X12 interchange because a segment in the interchange is out of the sequence specified by the document schema.  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, have the sender of the interchange rearrange the segments in the interchange so they are in the order specified by the document schema, and then resend the interchange.
