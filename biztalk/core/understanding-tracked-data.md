# Understanding Tracked Data
When you run a tracking query, the tracked information appears in the results list at the bottom of the Query Results window.  
  
## Viewing message details  
 You can track message properties. You can also save tracked message bodies to a file and view them using non-Microsoft tools.  
  
-   You can right-click any message referenced by a service instance and select Message details.  
  
-   If the message is already processed but it was tracked—because you had tracking turned on—you can save it to your hard disk and examine it.  
  
-   You can attach to the orchestration instance and use the Orchestration Debugger.  
  
## Viewing service events  
 When a suspended service appears in the event log, you can investigate a service by using the **Message Flow**, **Orchestration Debugger**, **Show Tracked Message Events**, **Show Live Service Instances**, options from the **Context** menu.  
  
## Viewing orchestration events  
 Use the Orchestration Debugger to view the path a message instance has taken through an orchestration. As you step through, a rendered image of the orchestration shows the progress of the message, and allows you to place breakpoints in the orchestration for debugging purposes.
