# How to Secure Pipelines

## Authentication trusted
Hosts can be marked in the administration console as **Authentication Trusted**. Denoting a host as Authentication Trusted means that the Microsoft BizTalk Server will trust the security-related properties sent on the message context of a message from that host. The security-related properties on the message context are the **OriginatorPID**, which corresponds to the message context property BTS.SourcePartyID, and the **OriginatorSID**, which corresponds to the message context property **BTS.WindowsUser**. For more information, see **Message Context Properties** [!INCLUDE[ui-guidance-developers-reference](../includes/ui-guidance-developers-reference.md)].  
  
 A host that is marked as **Authentication Trusted** is allowed to indicate that the trusted host is adding a message to the queue from someone other than itself as the sender of the message. In other words, hosts that are not marked as **Authentication Trusted** are not allowed to add a message to the queue from a message sender other than themselves.

>  The MIME/SMIME Decoder pipeline component does not check the expiration date of decryption certificates. However, it does check the expiration date of signing certificates.
