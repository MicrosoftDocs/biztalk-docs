# How to Map Multiple Assemblies
BizTalk applications can consist of multiple assemblies in which the data items that a BAM activity references reside. The following procedure shows you how to map multiple assemblies to a tracking profile.  
  
### To map multiple assemblies  
  
1.  Open an existing tracking profile or create a new tracking profile. For more information about creating a tracking profile, see [How to Create a Tracking Profile](../core/how-to-create-a-tracking-profile.md).  
  
2.  Click the **Select Event Source** button (located above the right pane in the Tracking Profile Editor).  
  
3.  Select the **Select Orchestration Schedule** menu item from the cascading menu.  
  
4.  Select the parent assembly from which to draw the orchestration by clicking the assembly containing the orchestration in the **Assembly Name** list box, and then click **Next**.  
  
5.  Select the orchestration that is the source for the data items in the **Orchestration Names** list box, and then click **OK**.  
  
6.  Select the data items in the right pane and drag them to the appropriate nodes in the activity in the left pane.  
  
7.  Repeat steps 2 through 6 to map additional assemblies.  
  
### To map the second assembly  
  
1.  Click the **Select Event Source**.  
  
2.  Select the **Select Orchestration Schedule** menu item from the cascading menu.  
  
3.  Select the next parent assembly from which to draw the orchestration by clicking the assembly containing the orchestration in the **Assembly Name** list box, and then click the **Next** button.  
  
4.  Select the orchestration that is the source for the data items in the **Orchestration Names** list box, and then click **OK**.  
  
5.  Select the data items in the right pane and drag them to the appropriate nodes in the activity in the left pane.
