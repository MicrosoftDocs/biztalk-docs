| In [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)], set deployment properties for each project in the BizTalk solution. Properties include the name of the database server and BizTalk Management database for the group, and the name of the destination BizTalk application. You can also enable redeployment and specify the option to automatically restart the host instances upon redeployment. |                                                                                                                                      [How to Set Deployment Properties in Visual Studio](../core/how-to-set-deployment-properties-in-visual-studio.md)                                                                                                                                      |
