| In [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)], set deployment properties for each project in the BizTalk solution. Properties include the name of the database server and BizTalk Management database for the group, and the name of the destination BizTalk application. You can also enable redeployment and specify the option to automatically restart the host instances upon redeployment. |                                                                                                                                      [How to Set Deployment Properties in Visual Studio](../core/how-to-set-deployment-properties-in-visual-studio.md)                                                                                                                                      |

If you have made any changes, export the application into an .msi file that you will use to install the application on the computers that will run it. You can also import the application into other BizTalk groups where you want to deploy it.                    | [Creating and Modifying BizTalk Applications](../core/creating-and-modifying-biztalk-applications.md), [How to Add a Binding File to an Application](../core/how-to-add-a-binding-file-to-an-application2.md), [How to Export a BizTalk Application](../core/how-to-export-a-biztalk-application.md), [How to Import a BizTalk Application](../core/how-to-import-a-biztalk-application.md) |
