# Managing Hosts and Service Accounts
After you configure BizTalk Server, you must manage Windows groups and user accounts. This section provides information about how to manage these accounts for BizTalk Server.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  For a multiserver installation of BizTalk Server you must use a Domain Global group. For a single server installation of BizTalk Server you can use either a Domain Global group or a local group.  
  
 You must be a Windows administrator to perform the following tasks:  
  
- Create a host Windows group  
  
- Create service accounts for each host instance  
  
- Add the service accounts to the host Windows group  
  
- Modify the Windows group associated with the host  
  
  For a complete list and description of the groups and their affiliated user accounts in the BizTalk Server, see [Windows Groups and User Accounts in BizTalk Server](../core/windows-groups-and-user-accounts-in-biztalk-server.md).
