# Step 3: Create the BizTalk Server Solution in Visual Studio
In this section, we look at creating the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] solution for receiving opportunity notifications from Salesforce, querying Salesforce to get additional information about the opportunity, and finally inserting that information into an on-premise SQL Server database. This section is further categorized according to each of these broader steps.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  To be able to send messages to Salesforce and to receive messages from Salesforce into [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], we need to include some custom components into our solution. We create those custom components in [Step 3d: Enabling BizTalk Server to Send and Receive Messages from Salesforce](../core/step-3d-enabling-biztalk-server-to-send-and-receive-messages-from-salesforce.md).
