|  Message Text   | A new group mapping could not be created because there is a conflict with an existing mapping. Please delete the existing mapping and try again.%r<br /><br /> Existing Mapping: %1%r<br /><br /> New Mapping: %2%r<br /><br /> External Account: %3%r<br /><br /> Application Name: %4 |
  
## Explanation  
 The most likely cause is that your system is using an old version of Enterprise Single Sign-On, and old group applications.  
  
## User Action  
 Delete and recreate the mapping as suggested in the warning. If this fails, you may need to upgrade to a more recent version of Enterprise Single Sign-On.
