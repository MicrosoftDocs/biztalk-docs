## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that BizTalk Server could not return a synchronous MDN after receiving an AS2 message because the HTTP receive port that processed the incoming AS2 message was a one-way port. A two-way request-response receive port is required to return a synchronous MDN in response to an incoming AS2 message. In this case, the MDN must be returned synchronously because the AS2 message includes the Disposition-Notification-To header, or in the configuration for the party as an AS2 Message Sender, the Override inbound message properties property is checked, the Generate MDN property is checked, and the Transmit MDN asynchronously property is cleared.  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, change the receive port that is receiving the AS2 message to be a request response receive port, rather than a one-way receive port. Set the send pipeline of the request response receive location to be AS2EdiSend for an EDI interchange or AS2Send for a non-EDI interchange.
