# PartyResolution (BizTalk Server Sample)
The PartyResolution sample demonstrates how to use BizTalk orchestrations with party resolution to route messages to one of two possible recipients.  
  
## What This Sample Does  
 This sample runs multiple orchestrations that demonstrate the following different roles:  
  
-   Buyer orchestration, used to initiate the purchase order (PO) message processing.  
  
-   Supplier orchestration, which demonstrates both inbound and outbound party resolution.  
  
-   ShipmentAgency1 and ShipmentAgency2 orchestrations, which respond to the supplier orchestration based on the shipment destination in the PO.  
  
## How This Sample is Designed and Why  
 Party resolution refers to the process of determining who (that is, what party) sends a message. For example, you may want to enable only known parties to send a message. Outbound party resolution is the process by which you determine which parties should be sent a message.  
  
 In addition to party resolution, this sample demonstrates how to implement and use roles. For example, to process the shipment of your product, you create a send port to which you send a document instructing a shipper to ship your product. If you have multiple shippers to choose from, you can create a shipper role in your orchestration rather than create multiple send ports whose only difference is the shipper's URL. You can then send messages relating to product shipment to the shipper role. You create parties and associate a send port to each party and party certificate. Finally, you enlist each party to the shipper role to enable it. In the orchestration, you can then dynamically specify which shipper you are sending the message to.  
  
 This sample also demonstrates how to use correlation to match the incoming message to the right orchestration instance.  
  
-   The business process flows for the buyer, supplier, and shipping agencies are as follows:  
  
-   Buyer business process flow:  
  
    1.  Receive PO message from internal department as an .xml file.  
  
    2.  Send PO message to supplier.  
  
-   Supplier business process flow:  
  
    1.  Resolve the party (inbound party resolution) to update the source party based on signature certificate.  
  
    2.  Receive an activation message (PO) from buyer.  
  
    3.  Send a PO Acknowledgement message to buyer.  
  
    4.  Verify the delivery country/region.  
  
    5.  Resolve the outbound party to find which shipping agency to use. If the country/region is U.S., the shipping agency is ShipmentAgency2. If the country/region is Canada, the shipping agency is ShipmentAgency1.  
  
    6.  Send a Shipment Order Request message to the appropriate shipping agency.  
  
    7.  Receive the Shipment Order Acknowledgement message from the appropriate shipping agency.  
  
    8.  Send a Shipment Advice message to the appropriate shipping agency.  
  
    9. Receive a Shipment Advice Acknowledgement message from the appropriate shipping agency.  
  
    10. Send a final PO Delivery Receipt message to the buyer.  
  
-   Shipping agency business process flow (same for both shipping agencies):  
  
    1.  Receive the Shipment Order Request message from the supplier.  
  
    2.  Generate and send an Acknowledgement message for the Shipment Order Request message.  
  
    3.  Receive a Shipment Advice message from the supplier.  
  
    4.  Generate and send an Acknowledgement message for the Shipment Advice message.  
  
 The following statements explain how this sample is designed:  
  
-   The BuyerProcess.odx orchestration receives a message and uses the custom pipeline MimePartyResSendPipeline to encode the message and send it to the supplier. This is done by using Pipeline Designer to build and deploy a custom send pipeline. Before sending the message to the supplier, the message is digitally signed with buyer's private key, which is specified in BizTalk Group Properties in the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console.  
  
-   The SupplierProcess.odx orchestration uses the custom pipeline MimePartyResReceivePipeline, which includes a MIME/SMIME decoder component, to decode the message and perform inbound party resolution by using the buyer's public key to resolve and validate the buyer's identity. This is done by building and deploying a custom receive pipeline.  
  
-   The supplier orchestration then initiates the POCorrelationSets which is defined to base on a promoted property - PONo. The PONo is used to match the inbound and outbound messages to this orchestration instance in the later stage, because there are multiple send and receive actions throughout the entire orchestration.  
  
-   The supplier orchestration implements role links to deal with inbound and outbound party resolution. The supplier orchestration uses two role link types:  
  
    -   Buyer_Supplier role link type  
  
    -   Supplier_Shipment role link type  
  
-   In the Buyer_Supplier **Role Link** shape, the supplier is in the Provider role and the buyer is in the Consumer role because the supplier receives the first message from the buyer. When the supplier orchestration sends the acknowledgment to the buyer role, there is a send port associated with the buyer, and the message is sent to the buyer through the specified send port. To find the send port, right-click **BuyerAgency** in the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console and then click **Properties**. The send port is displayed under **Send Ports**.  
  
-   The orchestration then uses the following expression to return the partner information, and writes an XML file to a folder through a call to an external assembly named CheckPartyName.  
  
    ```  
    Buyer_Supplier(Microsoft.XLANGs.BaseTypes.SourceParty)  
    ```  
  
-   In the Supplier_Shipment **Role Link** shape, the Shipment role contains a send port with two operations that are used to send the message from the supplier to the appropriate shipping agency depending on the destination party. The Supplier role contains a receive port with two operations that are used to receive the response from the shipping agency. The correlation is used when sending and receiving these messages, and it is based on the PONo.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  When you bind the supplier orchestration, you will find that only one send port and two receive ports need to be bound. This is because the send ports to the destination parties are already bound with the parties. Moreover, one of the receive ports in the orchestration contains two receive operations, so even if you see three **Receive** shapes, only two of them need to be bound.  
  
-   The supplier orchestration uses the first line in the following code to get the shipment agency by calling an external assembly named QueryShipmentCatalogComponent. It then uses the second line to set the destination party for the shipment role.  
  
    ```  
    strShipmentName= objQueryShipmentCatalog.GetShipmentDetails(POMessage.MessagePart_1.POHeader.Address.Country);  
    Supplier_Shipment(Microsoft.XLANGs.BaseTypes.DestinationParty) = new Microsoft.XLANGs.BaseTypes.Party(strShipmentName,"OrganizationName");  
    ```  
  
-   Shipper1Process.odx and Shipper2Process.odx are built to receive the shipping order and the shipping advice from SupplierProcess.odx and to send the response back to SupplierProcess.odx. In both of the shipper orchestrations, correlation is used, and the correlation type is based on the promoted property PONo.

## Building and Initializing This Sample  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Before you build and initialize this sample, you need to make sure that the default BizTalk In-Process Host is configured as Authentication Trusted. For more information, see [BizTalk Server Runtime Security Recommendations](../core/biztalk-server-runtime-security-recommendations.md).  
  
 The MIME pipeline component is not supported in a 64-bit host instance. The host associated with the send and receive handler for the file adapter must be configured as a 32-bit only host. For more information on this see [How to Modify Host Properties](../core/how-to-modify-host-properties.md). If you already have a 32-bit only host configured on the system, and want to use it, see [Configuring the File Adapter](../core/configure-the-file-adapter.md) for instructions on configuring the host(s) associated to the file adapter’s send and receive handler.  
  
 The certificate mentioned in this section must to be added to the Personal store of the Logon account configured for the default BizTalk In-Process host instance which will be signing messages.  
  
 By default the setup.bat file mentioned below will install the Party Resolution sample into the default [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] application. You can modify the setup.bat file to deploy the sample into a new [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] application by opening the setup.bat file and replacing the section preceded by the statement `@ECHO Deploy Assemblies...` with the following:  
  
```
