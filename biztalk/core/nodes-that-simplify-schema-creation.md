# Nodes That Simplify Schema Creation
The nodes that simplify schema creation is a miscellaneous category for two node types that defy categorization into the other categories, and which simplify the creation of schema. The first such node, the **Schema** node, corresponds to the **schema** element in XML Schema definition (XSD) language, which is the element that serves as the outermost element in all XSD schemas.  
  
 The other simplification node plays a more significant role in this regard. The **Attribute Group** node corresponds directly to the **attributeGroup** element in XSD, and provides a mechanism for defining a group of related attributes, which always occur together, in a single location and then using that group definition in multiple locations throughout the schema. The remainder of this section provides additional information about these nodes.
