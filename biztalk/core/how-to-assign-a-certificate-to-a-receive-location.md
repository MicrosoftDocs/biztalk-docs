# How to Assign a Certificate to a Receive Location
This topic describes how to use the BizTalk Server Administration console to assign a security certificate to a receive location. You can perform this procedure on a two-way receive location only. The certificate must exist in the Other People certificate store on the computer running BizTalk Server, or messages associated with this receive location will not be processed, and errors will be logged.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform the procedure in this topic, you must be logged on with an account that is a member of the BizTalk Server Administrators group. For more detailed information on permissions, see [Permissions Required for Deploying and Managing a BizTalk Application](../core/permissions-required-for-deploying-and-managing-a-biztalk-application.md).  
  
### To assign a certificate to a receive location  
  
1. Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerStartMenuItemui](../includes/btsbiztalkserverstartmenuitemui-md.md)], and then click **BizTalk Server Administration**.  
  
2. In the console tree, expand the BizTalk group and the BizTalk application for which you want to assign a certificate to a receive location.  
  
3. Expand **Receive Locations**, right-click the receive location, click **Properties**, and then click **Certificate**.  
  
4. If the certificate exists on the local computer, click **Browse**, browse to the certificate that you want to assign to this receive location, and then click **OK**. Otherwise, skip this step.  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   >  If you are performing this operation from a remote computer, make sure that the certificate exists on the computer running BizTalk Server, and not only on the local computer. Otherwise, the receive location will not be able to process messages.  
  
5. If the certificate does not exist on the local computer, in the **Thumbprint** box, type or paste the certificate thumbprint, and then click **OK**. The certificate thumbprint has the format HHHH HHHH HHHH HHHH HHHH HHHH HHHH HHHH HHHH HHHH, where H is a hexadecimal digit.
