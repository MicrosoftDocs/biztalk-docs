# Patterns in the Business Process Management Solution
This section looks at the basic programming patterns making up the Business Process Management solution. It begins by considering the enterprise patterns involved in the solution and develops those patterns into BizTalk patterns. It then looks at how those patterns are translated into BizTalk components and how those components are then grouped into assemblies and applications. The final section catalogs the patterns in the solution, whether those are enterprise patterns, BizTalk Server patterns, or other general programming patterns.
