# Step 3 (For Azure): Create a Service Bus Queue
In this topic, you create a Service Bus Queue to which the X12 sales order is sent after it is processed and transformed using the EDI agreement.

### To create a Service Bus Queue

1.  Sign in to the Windows Azure CTP Management Portal using your Microsoft account.

2.  On the lower left-hand side of the page, click **AppFabric**.

3.  Expand Services in the tree on the left-hand side, expand your subscription, and click a namespace that you must have already created. If you donâ€™t have a namespace already, see [How to: Create or Modify a Windows Azure CTP Service Namespace](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windowsazure/hh697699.aspx).

4.  To create a Queue click **New Queue** from the **Manage Entities** category from the toolbar at the top of the page.

5.  In the **New Queue** dialog box, enter a name for the Queue. For this tutorial, enter the name as `queueordersedi`, and then click **OK**. You specified this name as part of the EDI agreement you created in [Step 2 (For Azure): Create an EDI Agreement](../core/step-2-for-azure-create-an-edi-agreement.md).
