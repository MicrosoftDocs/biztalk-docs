# How to View the Dependencies for a BizTalk Assembly
This topic describes how to use the BizTalk Server Administration console to view the list of artifacts that have dependencies on a BizTalk assembly. For background information about dependencies and how they affect application deployment, see [Dependencies and Application Deployment](../core/dependencies-and-application-deployment.md).  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform the procedure in this topic, you must be logged on with an account that is a member of the BizTalk Server Administrators group or BizTalk Operators group. For more detailed information on permissions, see [Permissions Required for Deploying and Managing a BizTalk Application](../core/permissions-required-for-deploying-and-managing-a-biztalk-application.md).  
  
### To view the dependencies of a BizTalk assembly  
  
1. Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerStartMenuItemui](../includes/btsbiztalkserverstartmenuitemui-md.md)], and then click **BizTalk Server Administration**.  
  
2. In the console tree, expand [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerAdminConsoleui](../includes/btsbiztalkserveradminconsoleui-md.md)], expand the BizTalk group containing the BizTalk assembly for which you want to view dependencies, and then expand the application containing the BizTalk assembly.  
  
3. Click the **Resources** folder, right-click the BizTalk assembly, and then click **Modify**.  
  
4. Click the **Dependencies** tab.  
  
    The name and status of the artifacts that have dependencies on this BizTalk assembly are displayed in the list.
