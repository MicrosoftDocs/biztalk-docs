# How to Configure Outbound Maps for a Send Port
This topic describes how to configure outbound maps for a send port by using the BizTalk Server Administration console. You use a map to apply an XSL transformation to a message sent by the send port without processing the message through an orchestration. You can add an outbound map, remove a map, or change an existing map to a different one. You can add more than one map to a send port, but each map must have a unique source schema. For background information about maps, see [Maps](../core/maps.md).  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform the procedure in this topic, you must be logged on with an account that is a member of the BizTalk Server Administrators group. For more detailed information on permissions, see [Permissions Required for Deploying and Managing a BizTalk Application](../core/permissions-required-for-deploying-and-managing-a-biztalk-application.md).  
  
### To configure outbound maps for a send port  
  
1. Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerStartMenuItemui](../includes/btsbiztalkserverstartmenuitemui-md.md)], and then click **BizTalk Server Administration**.  
  
2. In the console tree, expand the BizTalk group and the BizTalk application for which you want to configure the outbound maps for a send port.  
  
3. Expand **Send Ports**, right-click the send port, click **Properties**, and then click **Outbound Maps**.  
  
4. Configure outbound maps as described in the following table, and then click **OK**. Repeat as needed to add or remove multiple maps.
