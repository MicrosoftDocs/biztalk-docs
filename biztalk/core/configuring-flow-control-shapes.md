# Configuring Flow Control Shapes
Orchestration Designer provides a number of shapes that you can use to control the flow of your orchestration, either explicitly by using the **Parallel Actions** shape or conditionally by using the **Decision**, **Listen**, or **Loop** shapes. It also provides the **Delay** shape for you to pause the business process, and provides the **Suspend** shape and the **Terminate** shape to suspend and terminate your orchestration.
