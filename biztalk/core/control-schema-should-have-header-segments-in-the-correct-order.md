## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that the EDI receive pipeline could not process the incoming interchange because the headers and trailers for the interchange, groups, and transaction sets were not in the correct order in the interchange.  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, ensure that the ISA, GS, and ST headers, and the SE, GE, and IEA trailers, are in the correct order in the interchange, and then resend the interchange.
