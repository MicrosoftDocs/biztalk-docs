# What Is a Real-Time Aggregation?
The business analyst can define your pivot table as a real-time aggregation (RTA) or a scheduled aggregation. An RTA gives you an up-to-the-minute view of your data, for example, where a particular PO is in the shipping process. You can refresh your screen to update the view of the data throughout the day.
