# How to Set Label and Comment on Multiple Links and Functoids
You can set a common label and/or a comment for multiple functoids and/or links. This topic provides details about how to perform this operation.  
  
 For information about how to select multiple functoid(s) and/or link(s), see [How to Select Multiple Links and Functoids](../core/how-to-select-multiple-links-and-functoids.md).  
  
 After selecting multiple functoid(s) and/or link(s), you can do any of the following:  
  
-   Set a common label for selected links.  
  
-   Set a common label and/or comment for the selected functoids.  
  
-   Set a common label for the selected functoids and links.
