# Viewing Variables
You can view variables in two modes:  
  
-   When you are tracking archived data - offline  
  
-   When you are doing interactive debugging on live data  
  
 When working with archived data, the statuses of some variables that you can see are:  
  
-   Variables not yet in scope  
  
-   Currently active  
  
-   Values you can click for more details  
  
-   Values that have passed out of scope; you can no longer access any details
