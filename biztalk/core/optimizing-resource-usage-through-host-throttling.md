# Optimizing Resource Usage Through Host Throttling
[!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] makes use of several different Microsoft technologies, each of which can consume a significant portion of the memory, disk, and CPU resources available on the BizTalk server and the SQL server that contains the BizTalk Server databases. [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] employs a throttling mechanism to help manage the use of available resources to minimize resource use contention. This topic discusses the design of this mechanism. For information on how to adjust the throttling values, see [Using Settings Dashboard for BizTalk Server Performance Tuning](../core/using-settings-dashboard-for-biztalk-server-performance-tuning.md).
