|  Message Text   | There was an authentication failure. Make sure that a matching party exists for the message being processed. And the security/password information in the message matches the Party configuration |
  
## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that the receive pipeline was unable to process the incoming interchange because BizTalk Server was unable to authenticate the sender of the message.  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, do one of the following:  
  
-   Verify that the sender qualifier and identifier in the interchange header (fields ISA5 and ISA6 for X12 or UNB2.1 and UNB2.2 for EDIFACT) match the sender qualifier and identifier in the properties of a party (as defined in the Interchange Processing Properties page of the EDI Properties dialog box).  
  
-   Verify that the security/password information in the header of the interchange (fields ISA3 and ISA4 for X12 or UNB6.1 and UNB6.2 for EDIFACT) match the security/password information in the properties of a party (as defined in the Interchange Processing Properties page of the EDI Properties dialog box).
