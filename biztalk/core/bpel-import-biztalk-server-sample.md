# BPEL Import (BizTalk Server Sample)
The BPEL Import sample demonstrates how to create an orchestration from a Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) process description and its related artifacts.  
  
## What This Sample Does  
 Wide World Importers is a shipping company that provides automated shipping services to retailers. Specifically, Wide World Importers enables retailers to:  
  
-   Request order shipments  
  
-   Track shipments  
  
-   Confirm shipments  
  
-   Confirm invoicing and payment for shipments  
  
 While the availability of these services can be represented by using a Web Services Description Language (WSDL) document, a BPEL document describes the typical way in which the product companies are expected to call the services and how to expect responses from Wide World Importers.  
  
 When Northwind Traders hires Wide World Importers to handle their shipping, they are provided a BPEL file and some related artifacts that describe the entire interaction. Using the BPEL file, Northwind Traders creates a [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] application (BPELShipping) to automatically process orders through Wide World Importers.  
  
 This sample walks you through this scenario in which the BPELShipping application:  
  
1.  Receives an order from the Northwind Traders customer order system.  
  
2.  Sends a shipping request to Wide World Importers and requests confirmation.  
  
3.  Receives shipment request confirmation from Wide World Importers.  
  
4.  Receives pickup notification from Wide World Importers.  
  
5.  Receives shipment status messages up to and including when the shipment has been received by the customer.  
  
6.  Receives an invoice from Wide World Importers.  
  
7.  Responds to Wide World Importers with an invoice acknowledgment.  
  
8.  Receives a payment confirmation from Wide World Importers.  
  
9. Sends a final shipping confirmation to the ordering system.  
  
 A separate BizTalk application (ShipperProcess) is used to simulate Wide World Importers for this sample. The BPELShipping application communicates with ShipperProcess by using the FILE transport, which uses common file system locations for the communication.  
  
## How This Sample is Designed and Why  
 BPEL for Web services is an XML-based language to describe the business process so that it can be easily shared across different companies who want to do business with each other using Web services. BPEL describes how to handle the business process at the business protocol level, but it does not describe the internal process in a company, such as the steps a company would take to process a purchase order after receiving it from a partner. This sample is designed to show you how to import BPEL and corresponding WSDL files, convert them into an orchestration, and then start to run the business process with the partner.  
  
 The following is the step-by-step procedure showing how to import the BPEL and WSDL files and convert them into an orchestration to interact with a prebuilt BizTalk application (ShipperProcess). If you complete the following steps, you do not need to perform the steps described in "To build and initialize the BPELShipping application".  
  
#### To import from BPEL and build a working solution  
  
1.  In Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)], on the **File** menu, click **New**, and then click **Project**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Before completing this procedure, you must set up the ShipperProcess application to create the supporting processes and schema projects.  
  
2.  In the **New Project** dialog box, in the Project Types pane, select **BizTalk (Projects)**. In the Templates pane, select **BizTalk (Server) BPEL Import Project**.  
  
3.  In the **Name** box, enter **BPELShipping**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If you use a different name, you may experience problems with the final binding step.  
  
4.  Select a location for the project, and then click **OK** to start the BPEL Import Wizard.  
  
5.  On the **Welcome** page, click **Next**.  
  
6.  On the **Select BPEL, WSDL, and XSD Files** page, click **Browse**.  
  
7.  Select all the files from the \<*Samples Path*\>\Orchestrations\BPELImport\BPELSource folder, click **Open**, and then click **Next**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
