# How to Remove Accounts from a View
Administrators use the **remove-account** command to remove users from BAM views and protect BAM Excel Spreadsheet views from unauthorized access.  
  
 For information about viewing BAM views, see [How to List BAM Views](../core/how-to-list-bam-views.md).  
  
### To remove an account from a view  
  
1.  Open a command prompt as follows: Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **cmd**, and then click **OK**.  
  
2.  Navigate to [!INCLUDE[btsBiztalkServerPath](../includes/btsbiztalkserverpath-md.md)]Tracking  
  
3.  Type **bm remove-account -AccountName:\<account name\> -View:\<view name\>**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  On a system that supports User Account Control (UAC), you may need to run the tool with Administrative privileges.  
  
4.  Press **ENTER**.
