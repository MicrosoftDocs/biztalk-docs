## Back up a job using a script  
  
1.  Open **SQL Server Management Studio**.  
  
2.  Expand **SQL Server Agent**, and expand **Jobs**.  
  
3.  Right-click the job you want to create a backup script for, and then select **Script Job as**.  
  
4.  Select **CREATE To** or **DROP To**, then select **New Query Editor Window**, **File**, or **Clipboard** to select a destination for the script. Typically, the destination is a file with a **.sql** extension.  
  
5.  Repeat this procedure from Step 3 for each job you want to script. Refer to the list of BizTalk Server related jobs to determine which jobs you need to script.  
  
     At a minimum, you should back up the **Backup BizTalk Server (BizTalkMgmtDb)** job after it is configured.  
  
## Restore a job from a script  
  
1.  Open **SQL Server Management Studio**.  
  
2.  On the **File** menu, **Open** the file containing the scripted job.  
  
3.  Execute the script to create the job.
