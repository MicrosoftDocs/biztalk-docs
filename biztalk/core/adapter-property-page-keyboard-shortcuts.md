# Adapter Property Page Keyboard Shortcuts
As in any standard Microsoft Windows application, you can use keyboard shortcuts in the adapter property pages to access commands that are otherwise available by using menus. The following table describes the available keyboard shortcuts.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You must type comma-separated key combinations. For example, "CTRL+I, CTRL+R" means that you must first type CTRL+I, and then you must type CTRL+R. A key combination such as "ALT+Z, I, F" means that you must first type ALT+Z, but then can type "I" and "F" without holding down the ALT key.
