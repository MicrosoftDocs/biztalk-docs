# GetActivityEvent
Pushes the name of the current activity event onto the stack.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
<wf:Operation Name="GetActivityEvent"/>  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 None.  
  
## Pushed Value  
 String containing the current activity event.  
  
## Remarks  
 A workflow activity can pass through several states during the lifetime of the workflow. The Windows Workflow Foundation BAM interceptor supports most of the execution status values defined by the `System.Workflow.ComponentModel.ActivityExecutionStatus` enumeration, as shown in the following table.  
  
|Execution status|Description|  
|----------------------|-----------------|  
|Canceling|Represents the status when an activity is in the process of being canceled.|  
|Closed|Represents the status when an activity is closed.|  
|Compensating|Represents the status when an activity is compensating.|  
|Executing|Represents the status when an activity is executing.|  
|Faulting|Represents the status when an activity is faulting.|  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You cannot use both `GetActivityEvent` and `GetWorkflowEvent` in the same OnEvent element.  
  
## Example  
 The following sample contains an event filter expression configured to find a specific activity—FoodAndDringPolicy—in a Closed workflow. This is done by using a combination of operations including `GetActivityEvent`, `GetActivityName`, and logical operations.  
  
```  
<ic:Filter>  
  <ic:Expression>  
    <wf:Operation Name="GetActivityName"/>  
    <ic:Operation Name="Constant">  
      <ic:Argument>FoodAndDrinksPolicy</ic:Argument>  
    </ic:Operation>  
    <ic:Operation Name="Equals"/>  
    <wf:Operation Name="GetActivityEvent"/>  
    <ic:Operation Name="Constant">  
      <ic:Argument>Closed</ic:Argument>  
    </ic:Operation>  
    <ic:Operation Name="Equals"/>  
    <ic:Operation Name="And"/>  
  </ic:Expression>  
</ic:Filter>  
```  
  
 This filter pattern is common with Windows Workflow Foundation interceptor configuration files.
