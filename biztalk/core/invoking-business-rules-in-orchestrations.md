# Invoking Business Rules in Orchestrations
You can invoke a policy (or rule set) from an orchestration by using the **Call Rules** shape. The policy invokes the rule engine, which operates on the rules in the policy.  
  
 In addition to using Call Rules, the rules engine can be programmatically called from expression code, for example, in an **Expression** or **Message Assignment** shape. For information about programmatically executing policies, see [How to Execute Policies](../core/how-to-execute-policies.md).  
  
 This section describes configuration information and the procedures required to call and execute a business policy from a BizTalk orchestration.
