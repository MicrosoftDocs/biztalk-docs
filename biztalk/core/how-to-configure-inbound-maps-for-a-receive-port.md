# How to Configure Inbound Maps for a Receive Port
This topic describes how to use the BizTalk Server Administration console to configure inbound maps for a receive port. You use inbound maps to transform inbound messages from one schema to another; for example to transform messages received from a partner into a schema that your company uses.  
  
 You use a map to apply an XSL transformation to a message sent by the receive port without processing the message through an orchestration. You can add an inbound map, remove a map, or change an existing map to a different one. You can add more than one map to a receive port, but each map must have a unique source schema. For background information about maps, see [Maps](../core/maps.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The application developer can configure maps for a receive port during the development process by using the procedure in this.
