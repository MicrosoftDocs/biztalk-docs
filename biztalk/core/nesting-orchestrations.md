# Nesting Orchestrations
You can use the **Call Orchestration** shape and the **Start Orchestration** shape to invoke one orchestration from another. You can nest orchestrations to arbitrary depths as well: for example, a called orchestration can call a third orchestration, which can call a fourth, and so on.
