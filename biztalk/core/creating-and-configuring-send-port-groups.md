# Creating and Configuring Send Port Groups

## Overview
This section provides instructions on using the BizTalk Server Administration console to add send port groups to a BizTalk application as well as to configure and delete send port groups. A send port group is a named collection of send ports that can be used to send the same message to multiple destinations. You can bind send port groups to orchestration ports or use them for content-based routing (CBR) just as you can for a single send port. For background information on send port groups, see [Send Ports and Send Port Groups](../core/send-ports-and-send-port-groups.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can use Microsoft Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Object Model to create and run scripts that automate administrative tasks. For information about using WMI, see the **WMI Class Reference** [!INCLUDE[ui-guidance-developers-reference](../includes/ui-guidance-developers-reference.md)].
