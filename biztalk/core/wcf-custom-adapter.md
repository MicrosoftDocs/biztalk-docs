# WCF-Custom Adapter
The WCF-Custom adapter is an in-process adapter to allow configuring receive locations and send ports with any binding and behavior settings for Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) that are applicable to [!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../includes/btsconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)]. You can use the WCF-Custom adapter for scenarios that the standard WCF adapters do not support. The WCF-Custom adapter also enables you to use the WCF extensibility points in [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)].
