|  Message Text   | The interchange with id '{0}', with sender id '{1}', receiver id '{2}' had structural error. Last structurally valid functional group ID was '{3}' |
  
## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that the receive pipeline could not process the incoming X12 interchange, because a structural error occurred in the interchange after the indicated functional group. This may have occurred with an interchange that was being preserved, with transaction sets suspended on the error. As a result of this error, the transaction set (or sets) that included the error was suspended, but the rest of the transaction sets were processed as part of the preserved batch.  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, have the sender of the interchange fix the structural error, and then resend the interchange.
