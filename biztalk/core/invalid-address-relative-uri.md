## Explanation  
 You did not provide an isolated WCF receive location with a well-formed relative address. For example, http://localhost/svc will not work as a relative address. You cannot set the Address property of the isolated WCF receive location to a absolute address.  
  
## User Action  
 Use the following procedure to configure the receive location address.  
  
#### To configure the receive location address  
  
1. Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3ui](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3ui-md.md)]**, and click **BizTalk Server Administration**.  
  
2. In the Console Root, expand  **BizTalk Server Administration**, expand **BizTalk Group**, and expand  **Applications**.  
  
3. Locate your application and the locate your transport.  
  
4. Right-click the transport name.  
  
5. Click **Properties**.  
  
6. In the port **Type** list, select the correct port.  
  
7. Click **Configure**.  
  
8. In the **WCF [**<em>transport type</em>**] Transport Properties** dialog box, click the **General** tab.  
  
9. In the **Address (URI)** text box, change the address so that it starts with a forward slash ("/").
