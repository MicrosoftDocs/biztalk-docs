# RemoveApp Command
Removes (deletes) from the BizTalk Management database a BizTalk application as well as all of the artifacts it contains. This does not uninstall the application. For instructions on doing this, see [How to Uninstall a BizTalk Application](../core/how-to-uninstall-a-biztalk-application.md).  
  
 The remove operation will fail in the following cases:  
  
-   **The application is not stopped.** For instructions on stopping an application, see [How to Start and Stop a BizTalk Application](../core/how-to-start-and-stop-a-biztalk-application.md). The **ApplicationManager** SDK sample which is installed in the *\<Samples Path\>\\*Admin\ExplorerOM\ directory illustrates how to programmatically start or stop a [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] application.  
  
-   **Other applications contain references to the application.** If other applications contain references to the application you want to remove, you must first remove the references from the other applications. For instructions, see [How to Remove a Reference to Another Application](../core/how-to-remove-a-reference-to-another-application.md).  
  
-   **The application contains a send port group of which a send port in another application is a member.** You must unenlist the member send port before you can delete the application. For instructions, see [How to Unenlist a Send Port or Send Port Group](../core/how-to-unenlist-a-send-port-or-send-port-group.md).  
  
-   **The application contains a send port that is referenced by a party.** You can delete the reference from the party or move the send port to a different application. For instructions on performing these tasks, see [How to View or Edit a Party](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/42e6f3a0-8f7d-4f6c-ab05-a1fab7bf46ca) or [How to Move an Artifact to a Different Application](../core/how-to-move-an-artifact-to-a-different-application.md).  
  
-   **The application is the default application.** If you want to delete it, you must first make another application the default. For instructions, see [How to Change the Default Application](../core/how-to-change-the-default-application.md).  
  
-   **An orchestration in the application is enlisted, started, or has a suspended instance.** For more information about orchestrations, see [Managing Orchestrations](../core/managing-orchestrations.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If the application contains a policy that is in a deployed state, the policy is not removed from the Rule Engine database and continues to display in the Policies folder under the \<All Artifacts\> application node of the BizTalk Administration console. If you add the policy to another application, the policy remains in a deployed state.
