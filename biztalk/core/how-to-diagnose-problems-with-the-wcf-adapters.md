# How to Diagnose Problems with the WCF Adapters
This section contains steps that you can follow to help diagnose problems with the WCF adapters.

### Check the IIS log and HTTPERR log of the IIS server for errors

- The source or target IIS server log files can contain information that is helpful for troubleshooting problems with the isolated WCF adapters. By default the IIS log files on a [!INCLUDE[btsWinSvrNoVersion](../includes/btswinsvrnoversion-md.md)] computer are located in the following directory:

   <em>%WinDir%\\</em>system32\LogFiles\W3SVC1\

  > [!NOTE]
  >  *%WinDir%* is a placeholder for the location of the [!INCLUDE[btsWinNoVersion](../includes/btswinnoversion-md.md)] directory on the IIS server.

   By default the HTTPERR log files on a [!INCLUDE[btsWinSvr2k3](../includes/btswinsvr2k3-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[btsWinSvr2k8](../includes/btswinsvr2k8-md.md)] based computers are located in the following directory:

  > [!NOTE]
  >  The HTTPERR log file is available only on [!INCLUDE[btsWinSvr2k3](../includes/btswinsvr2k3-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[btsWinSvr2k8](../includes/btswinsvr2k8-md.md)] based computers.

   <em>%WinDir%\\</em>system32\LogFiles\HTTPERR\

### Use WCF message logging for fault monitoring and diagnosis of problems from the WCF adapters

1. WCF provides the capability to log incoming and outgoing messages for offline consumption. You can use message logging to see what the messages incoming and outgoing through the WCF adapters look like. WCF does not log messages by default. To activate message logging, you have to modify the configuration files that the WCF adapters use. For more information about WCF message logging, see "Message Logging" at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89003](/dotnet/framework/wcf/diagnostics/message-logging).

2. For the in-process WCF adapters, you can enable WCF message logging by modifying the application configuration file, **BTSNtSvc.exe.config**, for **BTSNtSvc.exe**. The configuration file can be found in the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] installation path. If you installed [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] to the default location, BtsNtSvc.exe will be in the directory [!INCLUDE[btsBiztalkServerPath](../includes/btsbiztalkserverpath-md.md)].

3. For the isolated WCF adapters, you can enable WCF message logging by modifying the **Web.config** file that the BizTalk WCF Service Publishing Wizard creates in the Web application folder.

4. To modify **BTSNtSvc.exe.config** or **Web.config**, open the configuration file by using Notepad, and then configure WCF message logging, as indicated in the following configuration example:

   ```
   <configuration>
     <system.serviceModel>
       <diagnostics>
         <messageLogging
              logEntireMessage="true"
              logMalformedMessages="false"
              logMessagesAtServiceLevel="true"
              logMessagesAtTransportLevel="true"
              maxMessagesToLog="300000"
              maxSizeOfMessageToLog="200000"
       />
       </diagnostics>
     </system.serviceModel>

     <system.diagnostics>
       <sources>
         <source name="System.ServiceModel.MessageLogging">
           <listeners>
             <add name="messages"
             type="System.Diagnostics.XmlWriterTraceListener"
             initializeData="c:\wcfTrace.e2e" />
           </listeners>
         </source>
       </sources>
     </system.diagnostics>
   </configuration>
   ```

5. You can use the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) Service Trace Viewer Tool to analyze messages logged by WCF. Service Trace Viewer is included in the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows Vista and [!INCLUDE[btsDotNetFramework](../includes/btsdotnetframework-md.md)] Runtime Components. You can download the Windows SDK from the Microsoft Download Center at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=75636](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=75636). For more information about using this tool, see "Service Trace Viewer Tool (SvcTraceViewer.exe)"at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=88991](/dotnet/framework/wcf/service-trace-viewer-tool-svctraceviewer-exe).

### Return managed exception information to the client in a SOAP fault to ease debugging

1. You can select the **Include exception in faults** option for the standard WCF receive location to return managed exception information to the client in SOAP faults to ease debugging. Use the following steps to select the **Include exception in faults** option.

   1. In the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console, expand [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3ui](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3ui-md.md)] **Administration**, expand **BizTalk Group**, expand **Applications**, expand **Receive Locations**, right-click a receive location using a standard WCF adapter, and then click **Properties**.

   2. In the **Receive Location Properties** dialog box, click **Configure**.

   3. In the transport dialog box, on the **Messages** tab, select the **Include exception in faults** option.

2. If you use the WCF-Custom or the WCF-CustomIsolated adapter, you can set the **IncludeExceptionDetailInFaults** property of the [ServiceDebugElement](/dotnet/api/system.servicemodel.configuration.servicedebugelement) to return managed exception information to the client. To do so, use the following steps:

   1. In the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console, expand [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3ui](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3ui-md.md)] **Administration**, expand **BizTalk Group**, expand **Applications**, expand **Receive Locations**, right-click a receive location using the WCF-Custom or the WCF-CustomIsolated adapter, and then click **Properties**.

   2. In the **Receive Location Properties** dialog box, click **Configure**.

   3. In the transport dialog box, on the **Behavior** tab, right-click the **ServiceBehavior** node, and then click **Add extension**.

   4. In the **Select Behavior Extension** dialog box, select **serviceDebug**, and then click **OK**.

   5. In the transport dialog box, on the **Behavior** tab, click the **serviceDebug** node, and then select **True** for the **includeExceptionDetail** property in the **Configuration** list view.

   > [!NOTE]
   >  Returning managed exception information to clients can be a security risk because exception details expose information about the internal service implementation that could be used by unauthorized clients.
