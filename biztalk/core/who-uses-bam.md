# Who Uses BAM?
There are two types of users who interact with the information worker features of BAM: business analysts and business users.  
  
 Business analysts use the BAM Excel Add-in to define the business processes they want to monitor. They also use the BAM Excel Add-in to define the way in which business users see the data collected by BAM. For example, a business analyst wants to present data about purchase orders and asks the following interesting questions about purchase orders:  
  
- How many purchase orders did the company receive this (year, month, week, day, hour, and so on)?  
  
- What is the current value of active purchase orders?  
  
- What is the average time it takes for a purchase order to move though the stages of the purchase order process?  
  
- How many purchase orders are in a particular stage of the process?  
  
- How many customers ordered a particular product?  
  
- What is the sum of the orders for a particular product?  
  
- Are the quantities ordered different across geographic regions?  
  
  The business analyst uses these questions to define activities that reflect the type of information that BAM should collect from the business process.  
  
  Business users use BAM to view the data defined by the business analyst and collected by BAM. A business user can use BAM in the following ways:  
  
- View data about a single instance of a process. For example, if a business analyst created an activity to monitor a purchase order process, a business user could use BAM to see data about a particular purchase order.  
  
- View data about related activity instances. For example, the invoice or shipments associated with a particular purchase order.  
  
- View aggregated real-time or archived data about a process. Aggregated data is data over time. For example, a user could view the number of purchase orders with a value less than $500 that were received in the last (week, month, year, and so on), or the average value of purchase orders that arrived today.  
  
- View progress data, which allows a user to see data from the different stages of a process, such as the average time it takes for a purchase order to move from the received stage to the fulfilled stage.
