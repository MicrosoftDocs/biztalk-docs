# AS2 over File (BizTalk Server Sample)
The AS2 Over File sample demonstrates how to receive an AS2 message over a FILE receive location. This enables you to use a FILE adapter to receive the AS2 message, rather than an HTTP adapter, which is normally used. To do so, this solution writes the HTTP headers in the AS2 message to the InboundHTTPHeaders context property, as required by the AS2 Decoder.  
  
## What This Sample Does  
 This sample demonstrates how to process the HTTP headers in an AS2 message without having an HTTP adapter. Specifically, this sample does the following:  
  
1.  When you drop the test message into an input folder, the FILE receive location picks it up.  
  
2.  The custom pipeline component in the custom AS2 receive pipeline processes the message, writing its HTTP headers to the InboundHTTPHeaders context property.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If processing of the message fails downstream of the custom pipeline component, you may have difficulty resuming the processing of the message because it will have already been converted to XML encoding.  
  
3.  The AS2 Decoder in the custom receive pipeline processes the message, reading the properties in the InboundHTTPHeaders context property to do its processing.  
  
4.  A send port subscribes to the XML message generated by the receive pipeline, passes it through a passthrough send pipeline, and drops it into an output folder.  
  
## Where to Find This Sample  
 This sample is located in the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] installation folder: [!INCLUDE[btsBiztalkServerPath](../includes/btsbiztalkserverpath-md.md)]SDK\Samples\AS2\AS2 Over File.  
  
 The following table shows the files in this sample and describes their purpose.  
  
|File(s)|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|AS2OverFile.csproj|The project containing the custom pipeline component code.|  
|AS2OverFile.sln|The solution containing the AS2OverFile.btproj project.|  
|Program.cs|Includes classes representing headers data.|  
|SampleMessage.txt|The sample message containing HTTP headers.|  
  
## Implementing and Running This Sample  
 To implement the AS2 Over File sample, you need to do the following:  
  
-   Build and deploy the BizTalk project for this sample, creating the custom pipeline component  
  
-   Create a custom pipeline using the custom pipeline component, and build and deploy a project with that custom pipeline  
  
-   Create input and output file folders  
  
-   Configure a receive port and location, and enable the receive location  
  
-   Configure a send port and start the send port  
  
-   Create a party for sending the sample message  
  
#### To build a custom pipeline with the AS2 Over File Emulator Pipeline Component  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)], open the AS2OverFile project in the [!INCLUDE[btsBiztalkServerPath](../includes/btsbiztalkserverpath-md.md)]SDK\Samples\AS2\AS2 Over File folder.  
  
2.  Create a strong name key file, open the Properties dialog box for the AS2OverFile project, and assign the key file to the project.  
  
3.  Build the project.  
  
4.  In [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)], create a new BizTalk Project named AS2OverFile_Pipeline.  
  
5.  Right-click the AS2OverFile_Pipeline project, point to **Add**, and then click **New Item**.  
  
6.  In the **Add New Item** dialog box, select **Pipeline Files** in the left-hand pane, select **Receive Pipeline** in the right-hand pane, name the pipeline AS2OverFile_Receive.btp, and then click **Add**.  
  
7.  Click **View** in the menu bar, and then click **Toolbox** to display the Toolbox.  
  
8.  In the Toolbox, right-click **BizTalk Pipeline Components**, and then click **Choose Items**.  
  
9. In the **Choose Toolbox Items** dialog box, click the **BizTalk Pipeline Components** tab. Click **AS2 Over File Emulator**, and then click **OK**.  
  
10. Add the AS2OverFile.dll file to the global assembly cache by opening a [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] Command Prompt, and executing the command `gacutil /if "<file name and path>"` on the Microsoft.BizTalk.Sdk.Components.AS2OverFile.dll in the \AS2 Over File\obj\Debug folder.  
  
11. In [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)], drag the AS2 Over File Emulator pipeline component from the Toolbox into the **Decode** stage of the custom pipeline.  
  
12. Drag the AS2 decoder component into the **Decode** stage of the custom pipeline, after the AS2 Over File component.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If you want to generate an MDN, add an AS2 disassembler into the Disassemble stage of the custom pipeline. If you are not returning an MDN, the AS2 disassembler is not required.  
  
13. Create a strong name key file, open the Properties dialog box for the AS2OverFile_Pipeline project, and assign the key file to the project.  
  
14. Build and deploy the custom pipeline.  
  
15. In the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration Console, add the custom pipeline to the Pipelines node by clicking the Pipelines node, and then clicking **Refresh**.  
  
#### To implement the solution for this sample  
  
1.  In Windows Explorer, in the [!INCLUDE[btsBiztalkServerPath](../includes/btsbiztalkserverpath-md.md)]SDK\Samples\AS2\AS2 Over File folder, create an In input folder and an Out output folder.  
  
2.  In the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration Console, create a one-way receive port named AS2OverFile_Receive. In the receive port, create a receive location with the following properties:  
  
    |Property|Setting|  
    |--------------|-------------|  
    |Name|AS2OverFile_Receive|  
    |Type|FILE|  
    |Receive folder|[!INCLUDE[btsBiztalkServerPath](../includes/btsbiztalkserverpath-md.md)]SDK\Samples\AS2\AS2 Over File/In|  
    |File mask|*.txt|  
    |Receive pipeline|AS2OverFile|  
  
3.  In the Receive Locations node, right-click the AS2OverFile_Receive receive location, and then click **Enable**.  
  
4.  In the Send Ports node, create a Static On-way send port with the following properties:  
  
    |Property|Setting|  
    |--------------|-------------|  
    |Name|AS2OverFile_Send|  
    |Type|FILE|  
    |Receive folder|[!INCLUDE[btsBiztalkServerPath](../includes/btsbiztalkserverpath-md.md)]SDK\Samples\AS2\AS2 Over File/Out|  
    |File mask|%MessageID%.xml|  
    |Send pipeline|Passthru|  
    |Filter|BTS.REceivePortName == AS2OverFile_Receive|  
  
5.  In the Send Ports node, right-click the AS2OverFile_Send send port, and then click **Start**.  
  
6.  In the Parties node, create a party named "Partner". To the Aliases list, add an alias with a **name** of **EDIINT-AS2 From Value**, a **Qualifier** of **AS2-From**, and a **Value** of **Partner**.  
  
 BizTalk Server is now ready to work with this sample.
