# Manage Orchestrations

## Overview
This section provides instructions on using the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console to manage orchestrations. An orchestration is an executable business process. For background information about orchestrations, see [Orchestrations](../core/orchestrations.md).  

## Add to application  
 Orchestrations are built in [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] and compiled into BizTalk assemblies. You cannot add an orchestration to an application individually; an orchestration is added to an application as follows:  
  
- When you add a BizTalk assembly containing an orchestration to the application, as described in [How to Add a BizTalk Assembly to an Application](../core/how-to-add-a-biztalk-assembly-to-an-application.md).  
  
- When you import an .msi file into an application that includes a BizTalk assembly containing an orchestration, as described in [How to Import a BizTalk Application](../core/how-to-import-a-biztalk-application.md).  
  
- When a developer deploys into an application an assembly containing an orchestration from [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)], as described in [Deploying BizTalk Assemblies from Visual Studio into a BizTalk Application](../core/deploying-biztalk-assemblies-from-visual-studio-into-a-biztalk-application.md).  

## BizTalk Administration tasks  
 You use the administration console to perform the following actions, as described in this section:  
  
-   Configure bindings for the orchestration by binding the orchestration to the appropriate send and receive ports and host, or remove these bindings from the orchestration.  
  
-   Configure message tracking for the orchestration.  
  
-   View instance information for the orchestration.  
  
-   Enlist the orchestration to the appropriate host or unenlist the orchestration from the host.  
  
-   Start or stop the orchestration so that it starts or stops processing messages.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can use Microsoft Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Object Model to create and run scripts that automate administrative tasks. For information about using WMI, see the **WMI Class Reference** [!INCLUDE[ui-guidance-developers-reference](../includes/ui-guidance-developers-reference.md)]. 
> 
> [!NOTE]
>  The developer uses Orchestration Designer to create orchestrations, as described in [Creating Orchestrations Using Orchestration Designer](../core/creating-orchestrations-using-orchestration-designer.md). The developer can manage orchestrations during the development process by using the administration console, as described in this section.
