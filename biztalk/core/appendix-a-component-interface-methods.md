# Appendix A: Component Interface Methods
Microsoft BizTalk Adapter for PeopleSoft Enterprise provides standard methods for component interfaces.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The `interactiveMode` parameter, in the Ex-version of the methods, assists in debugging a call to the back-end (`Create/CreateEx`, `Update/UpdateEx`, and `DeleteOnly`). Each item in the *Ex call to the back-end is called separately, so you know exactly which item failed. There is a decrease in performance when you use an \*Ex method because each property's item receives a separate call. You can develop with \*Ex method and then switch to the main method (for example, `Create`) for production. You can also use a debug switch at production to switch between using the method and the \*Ex method.
