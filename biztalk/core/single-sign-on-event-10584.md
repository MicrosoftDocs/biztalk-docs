## Explanation  
 Impersonating the client is something the ENTSSO System does to verify the clientâ€™s identity. When the system is unable to impersonate a client, one of three things may have occurred. The client may be attempting to perform an usual activity, the client may be attempting to infiltrate system security, or the client application may have been designed to block impersonation.  
  
## User Action  
 Locate the client application and determine what it is attempting to do, and whether or not it is blocking impersonation.
