# BAM Event Bus Service Stored Procedures
You use the following stored procedures to manage the BAM Event Bus service:  
  
-   To pause the BAM Event Bus service, execute the TDDS_BlockTDDS stored procedure within a transaction (without committing the transaction) on the BAM database. To resume the BAM Event Bus service, commit the TDDS_BlockTDDS transaction.  
  
-   To enable the BAM Event Bus service on multiple computers, identify which host(s) to use for tracking, and then join those computers to the tracking host.  
  
-   To set up a session time-out and heartbeat interval, use the TDDS_UpdateSettings stored procedure. Only members of the BTS_ADMIN_USERS group have permission to execute this stored procedure.  
  
     The TDDS_UpdateSettings stored procedure has the following parameters:  
  
    -   @RefreshInterval int. Set to greater than 60 seconds.  
  
    -   @SqlCommandTimeout int. Set to less than RefreshInterval.  
  
    -   @SessionTimeout int. Set to greater than two times the RefreshInterval.  
  
    -   @EventLoggingInterval nvarchar(16). Set to greater than 60 seconds.  
  
    -   @RetryCount int. Set to greater than 60 seconds  
  
    -   @ThreadPerSession int. This parameter is obsolete.
