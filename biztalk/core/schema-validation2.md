# Schema Validation

The EDI receive pipeline and EDI send pipeline validate a message using the following schemas:  
  
- **Envelope validation**: Service schema in `Microsoft.BizTalk.Edi.BaseArtifacts.dll` in [!INCLUDE[btsBiztalkServerPath](../includes/btsbiztalkserverpath-md.md)]  
  
- **Transaction set validation**: Message schemas in the schema store in [!INCLUDE[btsBiztalkServerPath](../includes/btsbiztalkserverpath-md.md)]XSD_Schema\EDI  
  
- **Acknowledgment message validation**: CONTRL, 997, and TA1 schema in `Microsoft.BizTalk.Edi.BaseArtifacts.dll`.  
  
  The schemas in `Microsoft.BizTalk.Edi.BaseArtifacts.dll` are automatically deployed by the setup program. These schemas are listed in the **Schemas** node of the **BizTalk EDI Application** in the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console.  
  
  To use the message schemas, you must install them on the hard drive of your server by executing the MicrosoftEdiXSDTemplates.exe self-extracting file in the [!INCLUDE[btsBiztalkServerPath](../includes/btsbiztalkserverpath-md.md)]XSD_Schema\EDI folder, and then deploy them in your project in [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)].  
  
  **Schema Determination**  
  
  When the EDI receive pipeline processes a receive message, it determines the namespace of the schema to use in processing the message through the agreement lookup and schema discovery process. For more information, see [Agreement Resolution, Schema Discovery, and Authorization for Received EDI Messages](../core/agreement-resolution-schema-discovery-and-authorization-for-received-edi.md).  
  
  When the EDI send pipeline creates a message to send, it uses agreement properties to populate the envelope, and then performs schema validation of the information in the transaction set. After loading the schema, the send pipeline validates the schema against agreement properties (or fallback agreement if no agreement has been designated). If the schema validates, the pipeline validates the transaction set against the schema.
