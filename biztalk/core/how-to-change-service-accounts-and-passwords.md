# How to Change Service Accounts and Passwords
After you configure BizTalk Server, it is common for organizations to require changing service accounts or passwords by Account policies, such as Password Policy and Account Lockout Policy. For more information about Account policies, see the Microsoft TechNet Web site at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=62172](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc757692(v=ws.10)).

 When changing service accounts or passwords, you must do the following:

1. Create a new service account or change the password of existing accounts.

2. Ensure that the service account is a member of the necessary Windows groups. For information about the local or domain groups to which you must add the service account, see [Windows Groups and User Accounts in BizTalk Server](../core/windows-groups-and-user-accounts-in-biztalk-server.md).

   > [!NOTE]
   >  In a domain group environment, you use the Active Directory Users and Computers console. In a local group environment, you use the Computer Management console.

3. Do the following tasks depending on the type of service account.

   The following procedure describes how to change service accounts and passwords using the Configuration Manager.

### To change service accounts and passwords using Configuration Manager

1. Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerStartMenuItemui](../includes/btsbiztalkserverstartmenuitemui-md.md)], and then click **BizTalk Server Configuration**.

2. In the **Microsoft BizTalk Server Configuration**, click **View**, click **Service Accounts**, and then change service accounts and passwords in the **Service Accounts** dialog box. For more information about Configuration Manager, see [Import and Export BizTalk Server Configuration](../install-and-config-guides/import-and-export-biztalk-server-configuration.md).

   > [!NOTE]
   >  The Configuration Manager does not provide a centralized place to control over multiple computers. If you install Microsoft BizTalk Server on multiple computers, you have to change service accounts and passwords on each runtime computer.
