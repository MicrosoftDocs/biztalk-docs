 Note the following requirements before you begin this step:  
  
-   Before you begin this step you must complete the following steps:  
  
    -   [Step 1: Add EAIOrchestration Project to the Solution](../core/step-1-add-eaiorchestration-project-to-the-solution.md)  
  
    -   [Step 2: Define the Business Process](../core/step-2-define-the-business-process.md)  
  
    -   [Step 3: Add Ports to the Orchestration](../core/step-3-add-ports-to-the-orchestration.md)  
  
## Procedures  
  
#### To build the EAIOrchestration project  
  
-   In Solution Explorer, right-click **EAIOrchestration**, and then click **Build**.
