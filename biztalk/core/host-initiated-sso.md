# Host Initiated SSO
Host initiated Single Sign-On enables a request from the host system to access a resource on a Windows system. The host system (for example, a RACF account) exists in a non-Windows environment and under the context of a non-Windows user. The Single Sign-On Credential Store maps host accounts to Windows accounts, enabling this access.  
  
 The following topics describe configuration specific to Host initiated SSO.
