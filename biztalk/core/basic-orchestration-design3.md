# Basic Orchestration Design
When you create a basic orchestration, you receive XML in the receive port of your orchestration. The XML is sent to the back-end system to be processed. In the back-end system, an exception might occur that would stop the orchestration. The exception that is produced provides information that the orchestration was not completed.  
  
 When a fault occurs, the call is suspended. In the Event Viewer log, you can view the fault and the reason for the failure.  
  
 To prevent the orchestration from entering a suspended state and to redirect the fault, you can create a CatchExpression. To trap the exception generated by the back-end, and to help in locating the cause of the problem, you can use the Scope shape in your orchestration.
