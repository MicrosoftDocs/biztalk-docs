# Configuring Fallback Envelope Properties (EDIFACT-Transaction Set Settings)
In the **Envelopes** page of the **Transaction Set Settings** section, you define how BizTalk Server generates the UNG segments for an EDIFACT-encoded interchange that it sends to the party.  
  
 The UNG segment is the header that identifies and specifies a functional group of an EDIFACT-encoded interchange. It contains information about the date and time that the functional group was prepared, together with the type and version of the document in the functional group.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 You must be logged on as a member of the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administrators or [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] B2B Operators group.
