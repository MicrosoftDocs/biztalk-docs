# How to Modify Group Properties
You can use this procedure to configure global properties for your BizTalk Server group so that you can select a signing certificate, modify the cache refresh interval, and determine how BizTalk Server will handle large messages. For more information about BizTalk Server group properties, see [BizTalk Groups](../core/biztalk-groups.md).  

## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure, you must be logged on as a member of the BizTalk Server Administrators group.  

### To configure BizTalk group properties  

1. Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerStartMenuItemui](../includes/btsbiztalkserverstartmenuitemui-md.md)], and then click **BizTalk Server Administration**.  

2. In the console tree, expand [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerAdminConsoleui](../includes/btsbiztalkserveradminconsoleui-md.md)], expand the BizTalk group, right-click **BizTalk Group**, and then click **Properties**.  

3. In the **Group Properties** dialog box, on the **General** tab, do the following:
