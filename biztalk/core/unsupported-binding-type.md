## Explanation  
 The MsmqIntegration binding was chosen, but is not supported by the WCF adapter.  
  
## User Action  
 Use the WCF-NetMsmq adapter. If native MSMQ messages need to be exchanged, use the BizTalk MSMQ adapter.  
  
 For further information on configuring adapters, see the following resource:
