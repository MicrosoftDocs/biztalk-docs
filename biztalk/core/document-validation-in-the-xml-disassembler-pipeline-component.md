# Document Validation in the XML Disassembler Pipeline Component
By default, the XML Disassembler does not validate XML documents against a schema. However, you can configure the XML Disassembler to validate an XML document by setting the **Validate Document Structure** property.  
  
> [!CAUTION]
>  If a field for promotion is declared with a simple data type but contains complex data, the property promotion will cause unpredictable results. To avoid this scenario, configure the XML Disassembler to perform document validation by setting the **Validate Document Structure** property to **True**.
