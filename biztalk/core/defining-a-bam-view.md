# Defining a BAM View
Sometimes you do not want to expose all of your business data to all business users. You can create different BAM views that expose different types of information.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  All Alias, Duration, Group, Dimension and Measures names must be unique, as they will be part of the same view.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  To define a BAM view, you must have previously created at least one BAM activity. For more information about creating activities, see [How to Define a Business Activity](../core/how-to-define-a-business-activity.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  BAM views appear in the Excel workbook as worksheets. You can create many views for a BAM activity. Use the worksheet tabs at the bottom of the Excel application window to select a BAM view for editing.
