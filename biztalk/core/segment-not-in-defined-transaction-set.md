## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that the receive pipeline could not process the incoming X12 interchange because a transaction set in that interchange does not contain a segment required by the document schema.  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, have the sender of the interchange add the required segment to the transaction set in the interchange, and then resend the interchange.
