# Validation of Received EDI Messages
When the EDI receive pipeline processes an incoming message, it performs a series of validations on the envelope and message data. Some of these processes are always performed; some are performed only if you enable them. These validations include the following:  
  
-   **The validations that are always performed are**:  
  
    -   Validation of the structure of the interchange envelope.  
  
    -   Validation of the envelope against trading partner agreement (or fallback agreement if no agreement is defined).  
  
    -   Schema validation of the envelope against the control schema.  
  
    -   Schema validation of the transaction-set data elements against the message schema.  
  
    -   Validation of the types of transaction sets within a single group based on the transaction set -group mapping provided by X12 standards.  
  
-   **The validations that are performed only if enabled are**:  
  
    -   EDI validation performed on transaction-set data elements. This is performed if enabled in the agreement properties.  
  
    -   Extended validation performed on transaction-set data elements. This is performed if enabled in the agreement properties.  
  
    -   Cross-field validation on transaction set data elements (X12-encoded messages only). This is performed if enabled in the message schema.
