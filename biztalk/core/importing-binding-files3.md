# Importing Binding Files
Before you use the BizTalk Server to import a binding file, verify the following:  
  
-   The CLASSPATH is pointing to a specific location for the JD Edwards-specific files. Verify that the location of these files is the same on the new computer, or edit the binding file.  
  
-   The folders for the responses exist and are identical on the new computer, or edit the binding file.  
  
-   JD Edwards system passwords, if present in the configuration, are saved as ***** in the binding file. For more information, see [Deployment Limitations](../core/deployment-limitations2.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Deployment overwrites Receive Location configuration. When deploying a binding file (and assembly) on a target computer, the send ports and receive locations are replaced with those in the XML binding file when they are imported.

2.  Expand BizTalk Server Administration, expand **BizTalk Group**, and then expand **Applications**.  
  
3.  Right-click the desired application, point to **Import**, and then click **Bindings**.  
  
4.  In the **Import Bindings** dialog box, browse and select the binding files, and then click **Open**.
