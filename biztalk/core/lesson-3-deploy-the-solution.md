# Lesson 3: Deploy the Solution
The first step in deploying EAISolution is to add assemblies to the BizTalk Management database and the global assembly cache.  
  
 The second step is to configure and start the application.  
  
 In [Lesson 2: Define the Business Process](../core/lesson-2-define-the-business-process.md), you added logical ports to the EAIProcess orchestration. In this lesson, you define the physical ports, and bind the physical ports to the logical ports. You must also assign orchestration, receive port and send ports to hosts.  A host is a virtual container for BizTalk artifacts.  Each host has designated host instances to process the artifacts.  
  
 In this lesson, you learn about administering [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] artifacts by using the BizTalk Server Administration Console. For information about using the BizTalk Server Administration Console, see [Using the BizTalk Server Administration Console](../core/using-the-biztalk-server-administration-console.md).
