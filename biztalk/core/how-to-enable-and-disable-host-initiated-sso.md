# How to Enable and Disable Host Initiated SSO
By default, host initiated Single Sign-On is not enabled in the Single Sign-On system, and must be enabled by the SSO Administrator.  
  
### To enable host initiated SSO using the MMC Snap-In  
  
1.  On the **Start** menu, click **Programs**, click **Microsoft Enterprise Single Sign-On**, and then click **SSO Administration**.  
  
2.  In the scope pane of the ENTSSO MMC Snap-In, expand the **Enterprise Single Sign-On** node.  
  
3.  Right-click **System**, and then click **Properties**.  
  
4.  Click the **Options** tab.  
  
5.  Select the **Enable host initiated SSO** box, and click **OK**.  
  
### To enable host initiated SSO using the command line  
  
1.  On the **Start** menu, click **Run**.  
  
2.  In the **Run** dialog box, type **cmd**, and then click **OK**.  
  
3.  At the command line, go to the Enterprise Single Sign-On installation directory. The default is \<drive\>:\Program Files\Common Files\Enterprise Single Sign-On.  
  
4.  Type **ssomanage -enable hisso**.
