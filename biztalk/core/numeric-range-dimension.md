# Numeric Range Dimension
The numeric range dimension allows aggregations to be categorized based on friendly names of given ranges. For example, a business analyst can define a numeric range dimension named PO Size with the ranges Small for purchase orders between 0-$100, Medium for purchase orders between $100 to $1,000, and Large for purchase orders exceeding $1,000.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If a purchase order amount is not in the defined ranges, for example, a purchase order amount is less than 0, and then an "Out of range" row will be automatically created by BAM to accommodate the out-of-range data.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You cannot create two numeric range dimensions that reference the same data alias.
