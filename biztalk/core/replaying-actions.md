# Replaying Actions
The Orchestration Debugger enables you to replay the actions of an orchestration step by step. When you open an orchestration, the cursor is placed at the first action, for example, Initialization. Use the Up and Down arrows to step forward and backward through the orchestration. Follow the progress as the rendered orchestration focus moves from shape to shape.
