|  Message Text   | An invalid quoted HTTP header encountered.  Details are as follows:  Header Name: "{0}"  Header Value: "{1}" |
  
## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that the AS2 receive pipeline or the AS2 send pipeline could not process the AS2 message because the name of the AS2-From or AS2-To HTTP header in the message was not quoted correctly. The header name is quoted in order to accommodate a space, backslash, or double quotes within the name.  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, quote the header name in the AS2 message in accordance with the rules stated in section 6.2, "AS2 System Identifiers", in RFC 4130, "MIME-Based Secure Peer-to-Peer Business Data Interchange Using HTTP, Applicability Statement 2 (AS2)".
