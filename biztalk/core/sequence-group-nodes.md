# Sequence Group Nodes

## Overview
In BizTalk Editor, you can insert a **Sequence Group** node to contain other nodes that must appear in an instance message in the same order in which they appear within the **Sequence Group** node. The contained nodes must be nodes that correspond to XML elements, but cannot be nodes that correspond to XML attributes.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  In BizTalk Editor, the **Sequence Group** node is represented by default with the string \<Sequence\> in the schema tree view. If you set a reference to a **Sequence Group** node, such as x, it is represented as \<Group:x\> in the schema tree view.  
  
 You may want to add a **Sequence Group** to declare a global element group.  
  
 You may need to create a schema for XML as follows.  
  
```  
<Root>  
    <Record1>  
        <GroupItem1/>  
        <GroupItem2/>  
        <NotAGroupItem>  
    </Record1>  
    <Record2>  
        <GroupItem1/>  
        <GroupItem2/>  
    </Record2>  
</Root>  
  
```  
  
 Because GroupItem1 and GroupItem2 exist in both cases, you may declare a global sequence group that is a child of both Record1 and Record2. For step-by-step instructions about how to declare a global sequence group, see [Creating References to Another Node or Type](../core/how-to-create-references-to-another-node-or-type.md).  
  
 A user can change the hidden group to be a **Choice Group** node or an **All Group** node (so it is not necessarily a **Sequence Group** node) by changing the **Group Order Type** property. More details on this property [!INCLUDE[ui-guidance-developers-reference](../includes/ui-guidance-developers-reference.md)].
  
## XSD representation  
 When a **Sequence Group** node is inserted into a **Record** node, it is inserted at the end of any other child nodes within the **sequence**, **choice**, or **all** element in the **Record** node. The following example shows a new **Sequence Group** node, in bold type, inserted at the end of the **sequence** element in a **Record** node (with nodes named to clarify their identity).  
  
```  
<xs:element name="ContainingRecord">  
    <xs:complexType>  
        <xs:sequence>  
            <xs:element name="ExistingFieldElement" type="xs:string" />  
        </xs:sequence>  
    </xs:complexType>  
</xs:element>  
  
```
