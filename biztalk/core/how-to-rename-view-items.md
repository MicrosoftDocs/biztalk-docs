# How to Rename View Items
Often the data you collect for a business activity contains sensitive information, for example credit card numbers or social security numbers. This means that some types of business users should see only a filtered subset of the data.  
  
 You rename a view item in the BAM View wizard. Use this wizard to create business activities, items, and views. For more information about using the wizard, see [Define Business Activities and Views in Excel](../core/defining-business-activities-and-views-in-excel.md).  
  
### To rename activity view items  
  
1.  On the Excel menu, click **BAM**, click **BAM View**, and then click **Next** until you see the **Edit BAM View: View Items page** page.  
  
2.  On the **Edit BAM View: View Items page**, select the items in the list and then click **Next**.  
  
3.  In the second **Edit BAM View: View Items** page, select the view items you want to rename and click **Edit**.  
  
4.  In the **Rename data item to** box, type a new name, and then click **OK**.
