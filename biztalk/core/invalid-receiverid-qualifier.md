## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that the receive pipeline could not process the incoming interchange because the Receiver Qualifier in the ISA07 field (for an X12 interchange) or the Recipient Code Qualifier in the UNB3.2 field (for an EDIFACT interchange) did not match a value in the enumeration established by the service schema (X12ServiceSchema or the EdifactServiceSchema in BaseArtifacts.dll).  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, make sure that the ISA07 field or the UNB3.2 field matches one of the values in the enumeration established by the service schema. Have the interchange resent.
