# Publishing WCF Services with the Isolated WCF Receive Adapters
The BizTalk Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) adapters allow [!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../includes/btsconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] to communicate with WCF-based applications. The BizTalk WCF adapters include seven physical adapters. Each adapter, except the WCF-CustomIsolated adapter, consists of send and receive adapters.

 The WCF receive adapters are provided in two types of adapters: isolated WCF adapters and in-process WCF adapters. While in-process adapters are managed by [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], isolated adapters are not instantiated by [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)]. Rather, they are instantiated and hosted in another process. The isolated WCF adapters are hosted in Web applications running in Internet Information Services (IIS).

> [!NOTE]
>  Before you publish a WCF service with the isolated WCF adapters, you should have an understanding of how to host WCF services in Internet Information Services (IIS). For more information about the WCF services that are hosted in IIS, see "Hosting in IIS" at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=75700](/dotnet/framework/wcf/feature-details/hosting-in-internet-information-services).

 **Versions of IIS**

 The three isolated WCF adapters (WCF-CustomIsolated, WCF-BasicHttp, and WCF-WSHttp) can be hosted on the following versions of IIS on the following operating systems:

-   **IIS 7.0/7.5 on Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008.** IIS 7.0/7.5 provides the same advanced process model as IIS 6.0. The published BizTalk WCF services must run in ASP.NET Compatibility Mode of IIS 7.0/7.5.

> [!NOTE]
>  Even though Windows Process Activation Service (WAS) in IIS 7.0/7.5 allows activation and network communication over protocols other than HTTP, the isolated WCF adapters support only the HTTP transport.

 **Isolated WCF adapters**

 The following is the list of the isolated WCF adapters:

- **WCF-WSHttp adapter**. Provides the WS-* standards support over the HTTP transport. The WCF-WSHttp adapter implements the following specifications: WS-Transaction for the transactional interactions between external applications and the MessageBox database, and WS-Security for message security and authentication. The transport is HTTP or HTTPS, and message encoding is a Text or Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism (MTOM) encoding.

- **WCF-BasicHttp adapter**. Communicates with ASMX-based Web services and clients and with other services that conform to the WS-I Basic Profile 1.1. The transport is HTTP or HTTPS, and message encoding is a Text or MTOM encoding.

- **WCF-CustomIsolated adapter**. Enables the use of WCF extensibility features over the HTTP transport. The adapter allows you to select and configure a WCF binding and the behavior information for the receive location running in an isolated host.

  **Publishing WCF services with the isolated WCF adapters**

  To publish WCF services with the isolated WCF receive adapters, you must use the BizTalk WCF Service Publishing Wizard to create a Web application to host the isolated WCF adapters. Additionally, the BizTalk WCF Service Publishing Wizard generates the following files in the root folder of the created Web application:

|          Web.config          | \|ASP.NET configuration file that contains information for the ASP.NET Web application behaviors, the published WCF service behaviors, the metadata endpoint, and the BizTalk-specific settings. The default metadata binding generated by the BizTalk WCF Publishing Wizard is not secure and it allows anonymous access to the metadata. The service metadata contains a detailed description about the service and may intentionally or unintentionally contain sensitive information. To protect service metadata from unauthorized access, you can modify Web.config to use a secure binding for your metadata endpoint. **Note:**  Not all combinations of metadata endpoint bindings and service endpoint bindings are valid. In some cases, the binding configurations for a metadata endpoint must be in agreement with the binding configurations of its service endpoint. For example, the metadata endpoint cannot be configured with a security mode requiring the HTTP transport when the security mode of its service endpoint relies on HTTPS. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
