# Operations in Windows Workflow Foundation
This section contains the custom operations supported by the BAM WF interceptor.

## Determining Where Operations Are Allowed
 The custom operations provided by the BAM WF interceptor can be categorized by the associated Windows Workflow Foundation track point type:

- Activity

- Workflow

- User

  The BAM WF interceptor uses the categories to assign a track point type to each **OnEvent**. It bases this assignment on the types of operations it sees in the **OnEvent** filter and the data extraction and manipulation sections. For example, if the **OnEvent** contains an **Update** element that uses the **GetUserData** operation, it is a user track point type because the activity and workflow events do not support this operation. For more information about track points, see System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=80242](/dotnet/api/system.workflow.runtime.tracking.trackingchannel).

> [!NOTE]
>  Workflow track points cannot extract data from the workflow.

 Operations must be compatible both within a filter expression and between the filter expression and the data extraction and manipulation sections within an `OnEvent` element. The following table shows which operations can be used in a filter expression for each track point type.

|Filter expression operation|Valid for activity track point?|Valid for workflow track point?|Valid for user track point?|
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
|Equals|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|And|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|Concatenate|No|No|No|
|Constant|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|GetActivityEvent|Yes|No|No|
|GetActivityName|Yes|No|Yes|
|GetActivityProperty|Yes|No|Yes|
|GetActivityType|Yes|No|Yes|
|GetContextProperty|No|No|No|
|GetUserData|No|No|No|
|GetUserDataType|No|No|Yes|
|GetUserKey|No|No|Yes|
|GetWorkflowEvent|No|Yes|No|
|GetWorkflowProperty|No|No|No|

 If you mix incompatible operations, you will receive an error when you deploy your interceptor configuration file. For example, if you use both the `GetActivityEvent` and `GetWorkflowEvent` within a filter, or in a filter and data extraction or manipulation event (like **CorrelationID**), you will receive an error.

 The following table summarizes the operations that each activity type supports in data extraction or manipulation.

|Data extraction or manipulation operation|Valid for activity track point?|Valid for workflow track point?|Valid for user track point?|
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
|Equals|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|And|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|Concatenate|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|Constant|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|GetActivityEvent|Yes|No|No|
|GetActivityName|Yes|No|Yes|
|GetActivityProperty|Yes|No|Yes|
|GetActivityType|Yes|No|Yes|
|GetContextProperty|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|GetUserData|No|No|Yes|
|GetUserDataType|No|No|Yes|
|GetUserKey|No|No|Yes|
|GetWorkflowEvent|No|Yes|No|
|GetWorkflowProperty|Yes|No|Yes|

> [!NOTE]
>  There is a one-to-one mapping between a single **OnEvent** and a single track point.
