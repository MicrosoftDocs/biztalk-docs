# Configuring Fallback Acknowledgement Properties (X12)
In the fallback agreement, you can specify how [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] generates acknowledgments in response to X12-encoded interchanges received from the party and what type of acknowledgment to return to a party. This section provides instructions on how to do the same.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The acknowledgement properties described here apply also for HIPAA acknowledgements.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 You must be logged on as a member of the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administrators or [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] B2B Operators group.  
  
### To configure X12 ACK properties  
  
1. In the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration Console, right-click the **Parties** node, and then click **X12 Fallback Settings**.  
  
2. In the **X12 Fallback Settings** dialog box, in the **X12 Agreement Pages** tab, under the **Interchange Settings** section, click **Acknowledgements**.  
  
3. Select **TA1 Expected** to return a technical (TA1) acknowledgment to the interchange sender.  
  
4. Select **997 Expected** to return a functional (997) acknowledgment to the interchange sender.  
  
5. Click **Apply** to accept the changes before continuing with the configuration, or click **OK** to validate the changes and then close the dialog box.
