# How to Add a Send Port to a Send Port Group
This topic describes how to use the BizTalk Server Administration console to add one or more send ports to a send port group. You can only add one-way static send ports to a send port group.  
  
 You can add a send port that exists in a different application. If you do this, you must add a reference from the application containing the send port group to the application containing the send port. For instructions, see [How to Add a Reference to Another Application](../core/how-to-add-a-reference-to-another-application.md).  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform the procedure in this topic, you must be logged on with an account that is a member of the BizTalk Server Administrators group. For more detailed information on permissions, see [Permissions Required for Deploying and Managing a BizTalk Application](../core/permissions-required-for-deploying-and-managing-a-biztalk-application.md).  
  
### To add a send port to a send port group  
  
1.  Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerStartMenuItemui](../includes/btsbiztalkserverstartmenuitemui-md.md)], and then click **BizTalk Server Administration**.  
  
2.  In the console tree, expand the BizTalk group and the BizTalk application in which you want to add a send port to a send port group.  
  
3.  Click **Send Port Groups**, right-click the send port group, and then click **Properties**.  
  
4.  In **Send ports**, click the drop-down list under **Name**, and click the send port to add to the send port group. Repeat for each send port you want to add to the group. To create a new send port and add it, click **\<New send portâ€¦\>** and then follow the instructions in [How to Create a Send Port](../core/how-to-create-a-send-port2.md).  
  
5.  When finished adding send ports to the send port group, click **OK**.
