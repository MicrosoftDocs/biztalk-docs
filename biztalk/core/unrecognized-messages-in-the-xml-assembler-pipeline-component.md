# Unrecognized Messages in the XML Assembler Pipeline Component
The XML Assembler component treats a message as "unrecognized" if a message has:  
  
-   No body part.  
  
-   An empty body part.  
  
-   No data in the body part.  
  
-   No associated schema deployed.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Non-XML messages are always treated as unrecognized.  
  
 The manner in which the XML Assembler handles an unrecognized message is controlled by the **XMLNorm.AllowUnrecognizedMessage** message context property.  
  
 When **XMLNorm.AllowUnrecognizedMessage** is set to **True**, the XML Assembler handles XML documents as follows:  
  
- A message with no body part or with an empty body part or empty data in the body part passes unchanged through the assembler.  
  
- A document that does not have a deployed schema associated with it passes unchanged through the assembler.  
  
- A document with an associated deployed schema is processed by the assembler (regardless of whether the schema is explicitly referenced in a component property or found during the schema resolution process).  
  
  If **XMLNorm.AllowUnrecognizedMessage** is set to **False**, the XML Assembler handles XML documents as follows:  
  
- A message with no body part or with an empty body part or empty data in the body part is not processed. An error is reported and the message is suspended.  
  
- A message that does not have a deployed schema associated with it is not processed. An error is reported and the message is suspended.  
  
- A document with an associated deployed schema is processed by the assembler (regardless of whether the schema is explicitly referenced in a component property or found during the schema resolution process).  
  
- By default, the XML Assembler component does not allow unrecognized messages (that is, **XMLNorm.AllowUnrecognizedMessages** is considered **False** if it is not set on the message context).
