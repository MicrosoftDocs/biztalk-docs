|  Message Text   | The EDIFACT acknowledgement was generated by the system. However, it is missing a context property for Delimiter Set. It cannot be serialized |
  
## Explanation  
 This error indicates BizTalk Server cannot serialize EDIFACT acknowledgement, and a Delimiter Set context property is missing from the BizTalk message.  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, make sure to write the Delimiter Set context property to the BizTalk message context for EDIFACT acknowledgements.
