# How to Manage Views
In the process of developing BizTalk maps, you may want to change the sizes of the source or destination schema tree views, or the size of the grid view. Sometimes, you may want to open your map in the same view you had closed earlier. This topic provides step-by-step instructions for these tasks.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 These instructions require that BizTalk Mapper is running.  
  
### To make the schema tree views or the grid view taller or shorter  
  
1.  Move the mouse pointer to the bottom edge of the main editing window (which displays the schema tree views on either side of the grid view) until the cursor changes to the standard window vertical resizing icon.  
  
2.  Click and hold the left mouse button, and then drag the window edge either up or down.  
  
     You have vertically resized the schema tree views and the grid view by vertically resizing the entire main editing window.  
  
### To make the schema tree views or the grid view wider or more narrow  
  
1.  Move the mouse pointer to one of the two pane dividers in the main editing window (which divides the schema tree views from the grid view between them) until the cursor changes to the standard window horizontal resizing icon.  
  
2.  Click and hold the left mouse button, and then drag the pane edge either left (narrower) or right (wider).  
  
     You have horizontally resized one of the schema tree views and the grid view by changing the amount of the main editing window dedicated to each of these views.  
  
     Alternatively, you can also make the schema tree views and the grid view wider or narrower by horizontally resizing the entire main editing window.  
  
## Remembering the current view of Mapper  
 BizTalk Mapper remembers all the settings, such as zoom level, toggle states of utility ribbon options, and current alignment of links/functoids.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If you have multiple maps in a BizTalk project or solution, individual details of each map are remembered separately.  
  
> [!CAUTION]
>  The settings for previous view are stored in the **\*.suo** file. Ensure you do not delete this file from the project folder in Visual Studio.
