# Manage Resources

## Overview
The topics in this section provide instructions on how to use the BizTalk Server Administration console or the BTSTask command-line tool to manage BizTalk Server resources after they have been deployed into a BizTalk group. Resources include the following types of artifacts:  
  
-   BizTalk Assemblies  
  
-   Pre- and post-processing scripts  
  
-   .NET assemblies  
  
-   COM components  
  
-   Certificates  
  
-   Ad hoc files  
  
-   BAM definitions  
  
-   Binding files  
  
-   Virtual directories  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can use Microsoft Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Object Model to create and run scripts that automate administrative tasks. For information about using WMI, see the **WMI Class Reference** [!INCLUDE[ui-guidance-developers-reference](../includes/ui-guidance-developers-reference.md)].
> 
> [!NOTE]
>  Do not add multiple resources with the same name, regardless of case, to a BizTalk Server group. Adding multiple resources with the same name to a BizTalk Server group is not supported, even when the BizTalk Server management database is housed on a SQL Server that is configured to use binary collation and supports case sensitivity.
