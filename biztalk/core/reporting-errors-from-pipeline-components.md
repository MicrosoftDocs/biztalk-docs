# Reporting Errors from Pipeline Components
Pipeline components report errors in two ways:  
  
-   For .NET-based components, by throwing an exception.  
  
-   For COM-based components, by setting the **ErrorInfo** object and returning a failure HRESULT.  
  
## Reporting errors from .NET pipeline components  
 To report an error, a .NET-based pipeline component needs to throw an exception where it reports the error description. To report the name of the component that throws an error, set the **Source** property of the **Exception** object.  
  
 The Messaging Engine uses the **Message** and **Source** properties of the **Exception** object to report an error. The following message is written to the event log:  
  
 "There was a failure executing the [receive&#124;send] pipeline: \<pipeline name\> Source: \<Source\> [Receive Location&#124;Send Port:] \<location&#124;port name\> Reason: \<Message\>."  
  
## Reporting errors from COM pipeline components  
 To report an error, COM-based pipeline components perform the following actions:  
  
1.  The pipeline component sets the **IErrorInfo** object by calling the **SetErrorInfo** method.  
  
2.  The pipeline component returns a failed HRESULT to the Messaging Engine.  
  
 The Messaging Engine uses the **GetSource** and **GetDescription** properties of the **IErrorInfo** object to report an error. If the source is not set, the name of the component is used. If the description is not set or the whole **ErrorInfo** object is not set, the returned HRESULT is reported instead of the description. The following message is written to the event log:  
  
 "There was a failure executing the [receive&#124;send] pipeline: \<pipeline name\> Source: \<GetSource\> [Receive Location&#124;Send Port:] \<location&#124;port name\> Reason: \<GetDescription or HRESULT\>."
