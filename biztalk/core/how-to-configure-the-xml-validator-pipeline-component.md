# How to Configure the XML Validator Pipeline Component
The XML Validator pipeline component can be used in any stage (except Disassemble or Assemble) in a send or receive pipeline.  
  
### To configure the properties for the XML Validator pipeline component  
  
1.  Drag the XML Validator pipeline component into the Validate stage of a receive pipeline.  
  
2.  In the Properties window, in the **Pipeline Component Properties** section, set the following.  
  
    |Use this|To do this|  
    |--------------|----------------|  
    |**Document schemas**|Indicates the namespace and typename of the schema or schemas to be applied to the document. For more information, see [How to Use the Schema Collection Property Editor](../core/how-to-use-the-schema-collection-property-editor.md). If no schemas are specified, the run-time schema discovery will be done by using the message's target namespace and root element name information. **Note:**  You may receive a "Two or more of the selected schema share the same target namespace" error if you specify two or more schemas for the **Document schemas** property. <br /><br /> Default value: Empty collection|  
    |Recoverable Interchange Processing|When "false" - indicates that entire interchange is validated as a unit (if any contained message fails, entire interchange is suspended).<br /><br /> When "true" - indicates that messages within interchange are extracted individually by validator with possibility of some propagating through messaging pathway and others being suspended.<br /><br /> For more information on recoverable interchange processing, see [Recoverable Interchange Processing](../core/recoverable-interchange-processing.md).|
