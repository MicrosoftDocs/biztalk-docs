# Error - Node Not Valid For Distinguished Field Promotion
**Error Code**  
  
 BEC2014  
  
 **Explanation**  
  
 The indicated node cannot be promoted as a Distinguished Field because it cannot contain the required text content. Only **Field Element** nodes, **Field Attribute** nodes, or **Record** nodes with mixed or simple content can be promoted as Distinguished Fields.  
  
 **User Action**  
  
 Use the **Distinguished Fields** tab of the **Promote Properties** dialog box to remove the disallowed property promotion.
