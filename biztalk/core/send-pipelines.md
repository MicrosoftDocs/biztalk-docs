# Send Pipelines
The following figure shows the message processing workflow, highlighting the send pipeline.  
  
 ![Diagram of workflow for processing a message.](../core/media/ebiz-dev-busprcsadptc.gif "ebiz_dev_busprcsadptc")  
Depicts the message processing workflow.  
  
 A send pipeline is responsible for processing documents before sending them to their final destinations. The send pipeline takes one message and produces one message to send.  
  
 You can create a new send pipeline or you can use one of the two default send pipelines included in BizTalk Serverâ€”the pass-through send pipeline and the XML send pipeline.  
  
 By default, the send pipeline consists of three empty stages: Pre-assemble, Assemble and Encode. This topic contains design considerations for populating these stages.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  A send pipeline can produce zero messages when a consuming component is added to the pipeline.  
  
## Pre-assemble stage  
  
-   This stage is a placeholder for custom components that should perform some action on the message before the message is serialized.  
  
-   This stage is run once per message.  
  
-   This stage can contain between zero and 255 components.  
  
-   All components in this stage are run.  
  
## Assemble stage  
  
-   Components in this stage are responsible for assembling or serializing the message and converting it to or from XML.  
  
-   This stage accepts zero components or one component.  
  
-   All components in this stage are run.  
  
## Encode stage  
  
-   This stage is used for components that encode or encrypt the message.  
  
    -   Place the MIME/SMIME Encoder component or a custom encoding component in this stage if message signing is required.  
  
-   This stage is run once per message.  
  
-   This stage can contain between zero and 255 components.  
  
-   All components in this stage are executed.
