# Record Size in Tracking Databases
To help you plan your hardware requirements for BizTalk, the following table shows the expected record size for various event records in the Tracking database.  
  
|Action Type|Size|Notes|  
|-----------------|----------|-----------|  
|Deploying a Service|1864 + Symbolic Information Size|Symbolic Information depends on the size of the orchestration. For example, an orchestration that receives one message and sends one message out with 2 shapes in it takes approximately 4000 bytes.|  
|Started and Successfully Completed Service Instance|Normally 252 bytes.<br /><br /> Extreme cases, can reach 735 bytes.||  
|Started and Failed/Exception Met Service Instance|Normally 252 bytes + error information.<br /><br /> Extreme cases can reach 735 bytes + error information.|Error information is the text data returned by a BizTalk or user component. Ranges from 100 bytes to 2 KB.|  
|Start/End of a Shape In an Orchestration|120 bytes each.||  
|Message In/Out Events|Minimum 162 bytes.<br /><br /> First time message is seen it is 202 bytes + Message Property (if tracked)<br /><br /> Extreme cases can reach 2930 bytes.|You can safely assume that the average is 182 bytes if there is no message property tracking.|  
|Message Property Size|40 to 288 bytes if DTA recognizes this tracking property.<br /><br /> Add up to 268 bytes for tracking the property the first time.||
