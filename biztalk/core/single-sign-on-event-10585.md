## Explanation  
 Ticket time-out can be enabled or disabled. In this case a ticket is being redeemed even though its time-out period has expired, because the time-out is disabled.  
  
## User Action  
 If the time-out was supposed to be disabled, no user action is required. However, if you were not aware that this particular application had its time-out disabled, check the application immediately to be sure you want to allow it.
