# How BizTalk Server Receives EDI Messages
When [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] receives an EDI message, it performs trading partner agreement lookup and schema discovery, validates the message, sends an acknowledgment (if appropriate), and parses the EDI batch. This processing is performed by the EDI disassembler in the EDI Receive Pipeline.
