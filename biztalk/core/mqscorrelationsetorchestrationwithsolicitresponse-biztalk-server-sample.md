# MQSCorrelationSetOrchestrationWithSolicitResponse (BizTalk Server Sample)
The MQSCorrelationSetOrchestrationWithSolicitResponse sample demonstrates how to use a correlation identifier produced by the MQSeries Server instead of by [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)].  
  
## What This Sample Does  
 The orchestration sends a message with an empty value for the **MQMD_MsgID** property in the message header. MQSeries generates the MessageID and CorrelationID and returns a message with a value assigned to **MQMD_MsgID** and **MQMD_CorrelId** as part of the response in the solicit-response send port of the adapter. The orchestration uses the generated correlation identifier to initialize the correlation set and follows the correlation set in a subsequent receive location by checking the **MQMD_CorrelId** property of the message. The adapter also assigns the correlation identifier to **BizTalk_CorrelationID**, which you could also use in an orchestration. For more information about using correlation identifiers with the adapter, see [Correlating Messages Using Request-Reply](../core/correlating-messages-using-request-reply.md).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Orchestrations using this technique may experience problems if the message from the MQSeries Server arrives before the correlation identifier. Make sure that you design your orchestrations to allow enough time for the MQSeries Server to return the correlation identifier. This example does not consider this possible race condition.

## How to Use This Sample  
 To create the application, you must complete the following steps:  
  
-   Create two MQSeries queues.  
  
-   Set up a [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] receive location and send port.  
  
-   Enable the receive location.  
  
-   Start the send port.  
  
-   Create the appropriate folders.  
  
-   Modify the orchestration.  
  
-   Deploy, bind and start the orchestration.  
  
 If you have the required permissions to the MQSeries Server for Windows installation, you can create the MQSeries queue through the adapter dialog boxes, and can skip the next procedure. If you do not have such access, you can create the queue using the IBM WebSphere MQ Explorer. To create the queues through the WebSphere MQ Explorer, complete the following steps.  
  
## Creating the MQSeries Queues Through the WebSphere MQ Explorer  
  
#### To create the MQSeries queues through the WebSphere MQ Explorer  
  
1.  Click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to **IBM WebSphere MQ**, and then click **WebSphere MQ Explorer**.

## Testing the Application  
 This procedure tests the application.  
  
#### To test the application  
  
1.  Put a file in the **C:\Temp\Pickup2** folder.  
  
2.  Examine the files in the **C:\Temp\Dropit2** folder and the **C:\Temp\Moveit**folder.  
  
    -   The **C:\Temp\Dropit2** folder should contain a copy of the message that was originally picked up by [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)].  
  
    -   The **C:\Temp\Moveit**folder should contain a response document with the message identifier (MQMD_MsgId) and the correlation identifier (MQMD_CorrelId).  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If you disable the **MQReply** receive location, you can examine the message in WebSphere MQ Explorer and see that the message and correlation identifiers are set. To do this, launch the **WebSphere MQ Explorer** and examine the message placed in the **REPLYTOQ** queue. The message and correlation identifiers are displayed on the **Identifiers** tab of the **Messageproperties** dialog box.
