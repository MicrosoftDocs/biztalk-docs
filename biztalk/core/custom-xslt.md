# Custom XSLT
If you are familiar with Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) code, you can use it to customize, extend, or replace BizTalk maps. The simplest way to use XSLT is with the **Scripting** functoid. The **Scripting** functoid accepts scripts in many .NET-enabled languages, including XSLT. For more information about using XSLT with the **Scripting** functoid, see [Scripting Using Inline XSLT and XSLT Call Templates](../core/scripting-using-inline-xslt-and-xslt-call-templates.md).  
  
 If you have XSLT code that you have been using to convert one instance message into another, you can use that code directly in place of a BizTalk map. For information about replacing BizTalk maps with your XSLT code, see [How to Create a Map without Maps](../core/how-to-create-a-map-without-maps.md).
