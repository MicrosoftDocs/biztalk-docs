# Deploying BizTalk Applications
This section provides the following information about deploying BizTalk applications:  
  
- Exporting an application and its artifacts to a Windows Installer (.msi) file  
  
- Importing the .msi file into another BizTalk group to create the application and its artifacts in the new group  
  
- Installing the application on the computers that will run it  
  
- Installing BizTalk assemblies to the global assembly cache (GAC)  
  
- Monitoring the progress of the deployment and testing the application  
  
- Deploying an application to a business partner  
  
- Editing a binding file to customize the bindings for different deployment environments
