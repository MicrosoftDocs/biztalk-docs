# Deploying BizTalk Applications
This section provides the following information about deploying BizTalk applications:  
  
- Exporting an application and its artifacts to a Windows Installer (.msi) file  
  
- Importing the .msi file into another BizTalk group to create the application and its artifacts in the new group  
  
- Installing the application on the computers that will run it  
  
- Installing BizTalk assemblies to the global assembly cache (GAC)  
  
- Monitoring the progress of the deployment and testing the application  
  
- Deploying an application to a business partner  
  
- Editing a binding file to customize the bindings for different deployment environments  
  
  For checklists of tasks that you need to perform in different application deployment scenarios, see [BizTalk Application Deployment and Management Checklists](../core/biztalk-application-deployment-and-management-checklists.md). For background information on BizTalk applications and their deployment, see [Understanding BizTalk Application Deployment and Management](../core/understanding-biztalk-application-deployment-and-management.md). For information about creating an application and modifying it by adding or removing artifacts or adding a reference to another application, see [Creating and Modifying BizTalk Applications](../core/creating-and-modifying-biztalk-applications.md). For information about deploying BizTalk assemblies, see [Deploying BizTalk Assemblies from Visual Studio into a BizTalk Application](../core/deploying-biztalk-assemblies-from-visual-studio-into-a-biztalk-application.md).
