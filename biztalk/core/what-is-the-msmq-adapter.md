# What Is the MSMQ Adapter?
With the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Adapter for MSMQ (the MSMQ adapter), you can send and receive messages to Microsoft Message Queuing (also known as MSMQ) queues using Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)]. The MSMQ adapter supports Message Queuing 4.0. The adapter works with transactional and non-transactional, public and private, and local and remote queues. Additionally, the MSMQ adapter provides large (greater than 4 MB) message support and gives you access to Message Queuing 4.0 features such as remote transactional reads and reading from subqueues.  
  
 If you have upgraded your BizTalk Server installation to BizTalk Server, the BizTalk Server 2009 Adapter for MSMQ is not removed. Because BizTalk Server installs a new version of the MSMQ adapter, you can safely uninstall the BizTalk Server 2009 Adapter for MSMQ and then manually remove the directory structure for this version of the adapter.
