# How to Set the SSO Server Using the Client Utility
Each time you use ssoclient, you must first point the user to the correct Single Sign-On server that contains their configuration information.  
  
### To set the SSO Server for a user using the client utility  
  
1. On the **Start** menu, click **Run**, and then type **cmd**.  
  
2. At the command line, go to the Enterprise Single Sign-On installation directory. The default installation directory is *\<drive\>*:\Program Files\Common Files\Enterprise Single Sign-On.  
  
3. Type <strong>ssoclient â€“server *\<Single Sign-On Server\></strong><em>, where \<</em>Single Sign-On Server\>* is the name of the Single Sign-On server the user wants to connect to.  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   >  On a system that supports User Account Control (UAC), you may need to run the tool with Administrative privileges.
