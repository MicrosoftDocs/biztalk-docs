# How to Configure Outbound Maps for a Receive Port
This topic describes how to use the BizTalk Server Administration console to configure outbound maps for a receive port. You can use outbound maps with request-response receive ports to transform outbound messages from one schema to another; for example to transform messages that your company uses into a schema that a partner uses.  
  
 You use a map to apply an XSL transformation to a response message sent by the receive port without processing the message through an orchestration. You can add an outbound map, remove a map, or change an existing map to a different one. You can add more than one map to a receive port, but each map must have a unique source schema. For background information about maps, see [Maps](../core/maps.md).  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform the procedure in this topic, you must be logged on with an account that is a member of the BizTalk Server Administrators group. For more detailed information on permissions, see [Permissions Required for Deploying and Managing a BizTalk Application](../core/permissions-required-for-deploying-and-managing-a-biztalk-application.md).
