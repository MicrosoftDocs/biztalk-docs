# How to Add and Remove Correlation Sets
You can use the Orchestration View window to add correlation sets to or remove them from your orchestration. A correlation set is an instance of a correlation type.  
  
### To add and configure a correlation set  
  
-   In the Orchestration View window, right-click **Correlation Sets** and then click **New Correlation Set**.  
  
     The **Correlation Properties** dialog box appears. Add properties that you want to include in your correlation set. The correlation set and a corresponding correlation type will be created.  
  
### To remove a correlation set  
  
-   In the Orchestration View window, right-click the correlation set you want to remove and then click **Delete**.
