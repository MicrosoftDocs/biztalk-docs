# How to Enable a Receive Location
This topic describes how to use the BizTalk Server Administration console to enable a receive location. A receive location must be enabled before it can receive messages.  
  
 For instructions on creating a receive location, see [How to Create a Receive Location](../core/how-to-create-a-receive-location.md).  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform the procedure in this topic, you must be logged on with an account that is a member of the BizTalk Server Operators group or the BizTalk Server Administrators group. For more detailed information on permissions, see [Permissions Required for Deploying and Managing a BizTalk Application](../core/permissions-required-for-deploying-and-managing-a-biztalk-application.md).  
  
### To enable a receive location  
  
1. Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerStartMenuItemui](../includes/btsbiztalkserverstartmenuitemui-md.md)], and then click **BizTalk Server Administration**.  
  
2. In the console tree, expand the BizTalk group and the BizTalk application for which you want to enable a receive location.  
  
3. Click **Receive Locations**, right-click the receive location, and then click **Enable**.
