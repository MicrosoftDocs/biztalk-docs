# Using Pipelines from the Service Oriented Solution
The inline version of the customer service orchestration (**CustomerService**) calls the payment tracking system directly. To prepare the sent message and process the received message, the orchestration calls the pipelines from code. This allows the reuse of the pipelines from the other scenarios versions. It also maintains the decoupling of the orchestration from the pipeline stages.  
  
## Calling the Pipelines  
 To use the pipelines from code, you must create a message collection, add the message to process to the collection, create an empty message to receive the result message, and invoke the pipeline.  
  
 The following code from the **CustomerService** orchestration is in the **ConstructRequestMessageAfterSendPipeline** shape:  
  
```  
// Create the collection of messages to be sent to the send pipeline...  
sendPipelineInputMessages =   
    new Microsoft.XLANGs.Pipeline.SendPipelineInputMessages();  
sendPipelineInputMessages.Add(LastPaymentRequest);  
  
// Create an empty message for the output from the pipeline...  
LastPaymentRequestAfterSendPipeline = null;  
  
// Execute the send pipeline and get the message output from   
// the send pipeline.  
Microsoft.XLANGs.Pipeline.XLANGPipelineManager.  
    ExecuteSendPipeline(  
        typeof(  
            Microsoft.Samples.BizTalk.  
                WoodgroveBank.PaymentTrackerPipelines.  
                    PaymentTrackerSendPipeline  
        ),  
        sendPipelineInputMessages,  
        LastPaymentRequestAfterSendPipeline  
    );  
```  
  
 The **GetLastPaymentResponse** shape takes the message from the above code, sends it to the payment tracking system, and processes the returned message through the receive pipeline:  
  
```  
// Execute the inline method to send the message to the   
// Payment Tracking System and get the response.  
// The response message received should be passed through the   
// receive pipeline.  
  
LastPaymentResponseBeforeReceivePipeline =   
    Microsoft.Samples.BizTalk.  
        WoodgroveBank.  
            PaymentTrackerCall.  
                PaymentTrackerCaller.  
                    GetPaymeTrackerResponse  
                    (  
                        LastPaymentRequestAfterSendPipeline  
                    );   
  
// Execute the receive pipeline using the helper class so that we don't  
// need to declare the non-serializable types involved.  
  
// Set the documentspec name so the xml disassembler in the   
// pipeline can resolve the schemas for the received message  
// without ambiguity.  
LastPaymentResponseBeforeReceivePipeline(XMLNORM.DocumentSpecName) =   
"Microsoft.Samples.BizTalk.WoodgroveBank.Schemas.LastPaymentResponse, Microsoft.Samples.BizTalk.WoodgroveBank.Schemas, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=5f57a322d27bc5fb";  
// Create an empty response message and fill it in with the   
// real response from the Payment Tracking System  
LastPaymentResponse = null;  
  
Microsoft.Samples.BizTalk.WoodgroveBank.Utilities.  
    ReceivePipelineHelper.CallReceivePipeLine (  
        typeof(  
            Microsoft.Samples.BizTalk.WoodgroveBank.  
                PaymentTrackerPipelines.PaymentTrackerReceivePipeline  
            ),  
            LastPaymentResponseBeforeReceivePipeline,  
            LastPaymentResponse  
        );  
```
