# RemoveResource Command
Removes (deletes) an artifact from the BizTalk Management database. Running this command does not remove the artifact from the global assembly cache (GAC), file system, certificate store, Internet Information Services, or the Windows registry, if it exists in any of these locations. It does not remove a BAM definition from the BAM Primary Import database nor does it remove policies from the Rule Engine database. If you run this command to remove a binding file, the bindings remain unchanged â€“ only the binding file is removed.  
  
 You can use this command to remove the following artifact types:  
  
- .NET assembly (System.BizTalk:Assembly)  
  
- BAM definition (System.BizTalk:Bam)  
  
- BizTalk assembly (System.BizTalk:BizTalkAssembly  
  
- BizTalk binding file (System.BizTalk:BizTalkBinding)  
  
- Security certificate (System.BizTalk:Certificate)  
  
- COM component (System.BizTalk:Com)  
  
- Ad hoc file (System.BizTalk:File)  
  
- Postprocessing script (System.BizTalk:PostProcessingScript)  
  
- Preprocessing script (System.BizTalk:PreProcessingScript)  
  
- Policy or rule (System.BizTalk:Rules)  
  
- Virtual directory (System.BizTalk:WebDirectory)  
  
  The remove operation will fail in the following cases:  
  
- You attempt to remove a BizTalk assembly to which another assembly has a reference.  
  
- You attempt to remove a BizTalk assembly that includes a pipeline that is used by a send or receive port.  
  
- You attempt to remove a BizTalk assembly that includes a map used by a send port.  
  
- You attempt to remove a BizTalk assembly that includes an orchestration that is not in an unenlisted state or that has a suspended instance.
