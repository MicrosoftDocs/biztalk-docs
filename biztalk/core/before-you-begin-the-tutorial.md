# Before You Begin the Tutorial
Before you begin the tutorial, you must install BizTalk Server on a single computer, and also install the tutorial files. The tutorial does not provide instructions for a multicomputer environment. If you are working in a distributed [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] environment, you must take that into consideration when you perform the steps in the tutorials.  
  
## How do I install BizTalk Server?  
 The following two topics contain information about installing and configuring [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] on a single computer:  
  
-   [BizTalk Server 2016: What's New, and Installation](../install-and-config-guides/biztalk-server-2016-what-s-new-and-installation.md)

- [BizTalk Server 2013 and 2013 R2: What's New, Install, and Upgrade](../install-and-config-guides/biztalk-server-2013-and-2013-r2-what-s-new-install-and-upgrade.md)
  
-   [Basic Configuration](../install-and-config-guides/configure-biztalk-server.md)
