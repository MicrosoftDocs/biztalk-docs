|Message Text|Conditional required data element missing|  
  
## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that the EDI receive pipeline could not process the incoming interchange because a data element that is required by the X12ConditionDesignatorX rule does not exist in the interchange.  
  
## User Action  
 This error is likely an issue with the incoming interchange, not with the configuration or operation of BizTalk Server. To resolve this error, contact the sender of the interchange and indicate that they need to change either the characters used in the interchange or the character set identified in field UNB1.1 so that they match.
