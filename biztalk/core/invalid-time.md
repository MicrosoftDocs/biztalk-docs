## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that the receive pipeline could not process the incoming interchange because a time value in a data element did not conform to the data type specified by the EDI schema or the time value in the GS05 field header in an X12 interchange did not conform to the service schema (X12ServiceSchema in BaseArtifacts.dll). For X12, the service schema defines a time in the GS05 field as of the X12_TM data type and between four and eight characters in length.  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, make sure that a time value in a data element conforms to the data type specified by the EDI schema or a time value in the GS05 header of an X12 interchange conforms to the service schema, and then have the interchange resent.
