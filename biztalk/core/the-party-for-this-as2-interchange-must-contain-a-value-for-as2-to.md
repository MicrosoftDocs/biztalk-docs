## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that the send pipeline could not process the outgoing AS2 message because the AS2-To property was not set for the resolved party as message receiver. This indicates that the party for the outgoing AS2 message was resolved by matching the send port associated with the party with the send port that subscribed to the message.
