# How to Remove an Artifact from an Application
Removing or deleting an artifact deletes it from the BizTalk Server databases, so that it no longer appears in the administration console or in the list of artifacts for an application generated by the BTSTask ListApp command. It does not remove the artifact from the Windows Registry, the global assembly cache (GAC), a virtual directory, or the file system, if it exists in any of these locations. In the case of send ports, send port groups, receive ports, and receive locations, which exist only in the BizTalk Management database, this operation deletes the artifact entirely. For background information, see [What Happens When Artifacts Are Added and Removed](../core/what-happens-when-artifacts-are-added-and-removed.md)  
  
 Removing or deleting an artifact can have different effects on the functioning of an application, depending on the artifact type. For more information and instructions on removing or deleting a particular type of artifact, see the appropriate topic, as follows:
