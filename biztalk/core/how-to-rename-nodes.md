# How to Rename Nodes
There will probably be times when you want to rename existing nodes. This topic describes two variations on this task.  
  
### To rename a single node  
  
1.  Select the **Record** node, **Field Element** node, or **Field Attribute** node that you want to rename.  
  
2.  On the **BizTalk** menu, click **Rename**.  
  
3.  Type a new name for the node, and then press ENTER.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  You can also rename a node by changing the value of its **Node Name** property.  
  
### To rename multiple nodes to have the same name  
  
1.  Select the first node in the set of nodes to be given the same name.  
  
2.  Press and hold CTRL, and then select the remaining nodes to be given the same name.  
  
3.  In the Properties window, change the value of the **Node Name** property, and finish by pressing ENTER.  
  
     All selected nodes are updated in the schema tree view with the new name.
