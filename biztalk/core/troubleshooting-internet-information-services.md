This topic describes some known issues that you may encounter with IIS and possible resolutions to these issues.

## Known Issues

#### "500 - Internal server error" occurs when accessing a Web page on an IIS server

##### Problem
 When you attempt to access a Web page on an IIS server an error similar to the following is displayed:

 500 - Internal server error

##### Cause
 This error message can be caused by a wide variety of server-side problems.

##### Resolution
 To resolve the issue, do the following:

- Review the Application log of the IIS server for information about why this error occurs.

- Review the IIS log files or HTTPERR log files for information that may be helpful for determining the cause of the error. By default the IIS log files on a computer running [!INCLUDE[btsWinSvrNoVersion](../includes/btswinsvrnoversion-md.md)] operating systems are located in the following directory:

   <em>%WinDir%\\</em>system32\LogFiles\W3SVC1\

  > [!NOTE]
  >  *%WinDir%* is a placeholder for the location of the Windows directory on the IIS server.

   By default the IIS log files on a computer running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Vista are located in the following directory:

   C:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\W3SVC1\

   By default the HTTPERR log files on [!INCLUDE[btsWinSvrNoVersion](../includes/btswinsvrnoversion-md.md)] are located in the following directory:

   <em>%WinDir%</em>system32LogFilesHTTPERR

  > [!NOTE]
  >  The HTTPERR log file is only available on a [!INCLUDE[btsWinSvr2k8](../includes/btswinsvr2k8-md.md)], or Windows Vista computer.

#### "Service Unavailable" error occurs when accessing a Web page on an IIS server

##### Problem
 When you attempt to access a Web page on an IIS server an error similar to the following is displayed:

 Service Unavailable

##### Cause
 The most common cause for this error is that the application pool (IIS 6.0 and IIS 7.0) for the Web page is stopped. This commonly occurs if the application pool or COM+ application is configured with an Identity for which the specified user name and or password is invalid.

##### Resolution
 Follow the steps in the "Setting IIS Application Host Process Identity" section of the topic [Guidelines for Resolving IIS Permissions Problems](../core/guidelines-for-resolving-iis-permissions-problems.md) to set the appropriate host process identity.
