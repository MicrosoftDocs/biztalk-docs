# Service Oriented Solution
The service oriented solution shows how to present a BizTalk application as a service that is available as a Web service and in forms accessible to legacy applications. The solution also shows how to communicate with back-end processes as Web services, as well as how to aggregate responses from multiple back-end systems.  
  
 The sections provide an overview of the solution, detailed explanations of the patterns and design choices, and information about building and running the solution.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The patterns and guidance documented in these sections are intended to illustrate an approach to a particular kind of business solution. Patterns are simple mechanisms that are meant to be applied to a specific problem and are usually combined with other patterns. They are not meant to be plugged into an application. Example code is provided "as is" and is not intended for production use. It is only intended to illustrate the pattern and therefore does not include extra code, such as exception handling, logging, security, and validation. Microsoft does not support deploying the example code "as is" to production.
