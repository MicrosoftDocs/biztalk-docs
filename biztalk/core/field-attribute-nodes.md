# Field Attribute Nodes

## Overview
In BizTalk Editor, you use **Field Attribute** nodes to describe items of information that are simple in nature, such as strings and numbers. Further, they are used when the information in question appears as the value of an attribute in an actual instance of a message, as opposed to appearing as the content of an XML element. For additional information about information that is stored as element content, see [Field Element Nodes](../core/field-element-nodes.md).  

 Although the most straightforward use of **Field Attribute** nodes is as child nodes of **Record** nodes, they can also be used as child nodes of **Attribute Group** nodes. In the latter case, the **Field Attribute** nodes that are children of an **Attribute Group** node are available as attributes of any **Record** node that includes that **Attribute Group** node. For more information about **Attribute Group** nodes, see [Attribute Group Nodes](../core/attribute-group-nodes.md).  

> [!NOTE]
>  In BizTalk Editor, both the element and attribute elements can be represented by a **Field** node, though they have different icons associated with them in the schema tree view, a different XML representation in the XSD window, and different properties in the Visual Studio Properties window.  

 For any given item of information in an XML message, where item of information means a single discrete simple type, such as a string or number, there is always a question regarding whether that information should be represented as the attribute of an element, or as a subelement of that element. As a general rule, representing an item of information as an attribute tends to be more appropriate when the possible values are discrete, few in number, and tend to modify the semantics of the element itself. Representing an item of information as a subelement tends to be more appropriate when the possible values can repeat a variable number of times, are likely to have more widely ranging values, might be long, as in long strings, and are one of several sibling values where their order is relevant. If you are creating a schema for an existing type of XML document, your choice of using a **Field Element** node or a **Field Attribute** node for a particular item of information has already been made for you, and you must use the node that matches the XML.  

> [!NOTE]
>  Root nodes may not have **Field** attributes. **Field** attributes attached to the **Root** node are not saved with the schema.  

## XSD representation  
 When a **Field Attribute** node is inserted into a **Record** node, it is inserted at the end of any other child nodes in the **Record** node. This includes being inserted after the **sequence**, **choice**, or **all** element containing any nonattribute nodes, and after any attribute nodes that were previously inserted. The following example shows a new **Field Attribute** node, in bold, inserted at the end of a **Record** node (with nodes named to clarify their identity).  

```  
<xs:element name="ContainingRecord">  
    <xs:complexType>  
        <xs:sequence>  
            <xs:element name="FieldElement" type="xs:string" />  
            <xs:element name="EmptyNestedRecord">  
                <xs:complexType />  
            </xs:element>  
        </xs:sequence>  
        <xs:attribute name="ExistingFieldAttribute" type="xs:string" />  

    </xs:complexType>  
</xs:element>  

```
