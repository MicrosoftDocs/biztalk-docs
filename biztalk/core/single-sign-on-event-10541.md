|  Message Text   |    Tickets cannot be redeemed without being validated.     |

## Explanation  
 This Warning event indicates that SSO tickets cannot be redeemed without being validated. When SSO tickets are redeemed they can be validated or not validated. Validation improves security by comparing the name of the user who issued the ticket with the name of the user in the BizTalk message. If the names are not the same then validation fails. When a BizTalk message flows through an un-trusted host, the name of the user in the BizTalk message is changed to that of the un-trusted host. Validation ensures that the BizTalk message has only flowed through trusted hosts. This message means specifically that validation is required at the SSO system level (due to an SSO system option setting), but no validation information was provided by the caller.  

## User Action  
 To resolve this warning, do one or more of the following:  

- If you are using BizTalk Server, ensure that your message is flowing only through trusted hosts. This will reduce the risk of tampering with the data in the message.  

- If your scenario allows it, turn off validation for this application. Validation is an administration option which can be turned off for the system or just for this particular application.
