# How to Enable Routing for Failed Messages
Failed message routing is a property of send and receive ports, and is enabled by indicating "Enable routing for failed messages" on the port's property page.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The configuration on a receive port applies to all receive locations associated with that receive port.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The configuration on a send port applies to both the primary and backup transports.  
  
### To configure failed message routing for a receive port (this applies to both one-way and request-response receive ports)  
  
1. Open the BizTalk Server Administration console.  
  
2. Expand [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3ui](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3ui-md.md)] **Administration**, expand **BizTalk Group**, expand **Applications**, and then expand the application to which the send port belongs.  
  
3. Click the **Receive Ports** folder.  
  
4. In the right pane, double-click the name of the receive port you want to configure.
