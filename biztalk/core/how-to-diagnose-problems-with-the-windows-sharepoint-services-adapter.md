# How to Diagnose Problems with the Windows SharePoint Services Adapter
This section contains steps that can be followed to help diagnose problems with the Windows Sharepoint Services adapter.  
  
### Check the IIS and HTTPERR log files of the IIS Server for errors  
  
-   The source or target IIS server log files can contain information that is helpful for troubleshooting problems with the Windows Sharepoint Services adapter. By default the IIS log files on a [!INCLUDE[btsWinSvrNoVersion](../includes/btswinsvrnoversion-md.md)] computer are located in the following directory:  
  
     *%WinDir%\\*system32\LogFiles\W3SVC1\  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  *%WinDir%* is a placeholder for the location of the Windows directory on the IIS server.  
  
-   By default the HTTPERR log files on a [!INCLUDE[btsWinSvrNoVersion](../includes/btswinsvrnoversion-md.md)] based computer are located in the following directory:  
  
     *%WinDir%\\*system32\LogFiles\HTTPERR\  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  The HTTPERR log file is only available on [!INCLUDE[btsWinSvr2k8](../includes/btswinsvr2k8-md.md)] computers.
