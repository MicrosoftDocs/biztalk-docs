# SFTP Adapter
BizTalk Server includes an **SFTP** adapter to send and receive messages from a secure FTP server using the SSH file transfer protocol. This topic includes the steps to configure an **SFTP** receive location, and configure an SFTP send port to receive and send messages from a secure FTP server. It also includes common questions and answers.

## Prerequisites
**Starting with [!INCLUDE[bts2016_md](../includes/bts2016-md.md)]**, the SFTP adapter uses WinSCP to connect to SFTP, and therefore supports a larger range of SFTP servers. **Download [WinSCP](http://winscp.net)** on the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] runtime. Be sure to check the supported WinSCP versions in [Hardware and Software Requirements](../install-and-config-guides/hardware-and-software-requirements-for-biztalk-server-2016.md)

[!INCLUDE[bts2013r2_md](../includes/bts2013r2-md.md)] and previous versions do not support WinSCP.
  
## Configure the receive location
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Before creating the receive location, you must have already added a one-way receive port. See [How to Create a Receive Port](../core/how-to-create-a-receive-port.md) for the specific steps.  
  
 
1.  In the BizTalk Server Administration console, expand [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerAdminConsoleui](../includes/btsbiztalkserveradminconsoleui-md.md)], expand **BizTalk Group**, expand **Applications**, and then expand the application under you want to create a receive location.  
  
2.  In the left pane, click the **Receive Ports** node and in the right pane, right-click the receive port with which you want to associate the new receive location, and then click **Properties**.  
  
3.  In the left pane of the **Receive Port Properties** dialog box, select **Receive Locations**, and in the right pane click **New** to create a new receive location.  
  
4.  In the **Receive Location Properties** dialog box, in the **Transport** section, select **SFTP** from the **Type** drop-down list, and then click **Configure** to configure the transport properties for the receive location.  
  
5.  In the **SFTP Transport Properties**, do the following:  
 
     **Others**
         
    |Use this|To do this|  
    |--------------|----------------|  
    |Connection Limit|Specify the maximum number of concurrent connections that can be opened to the server.<br /><br /> This setting is per server and per receive location. Consider the following scenarios:<br /><br /> - There are two receive locations that have the same configuration property values, including the ConnectionLimit property set to the same value. For example, the property is set to 6. In this situation, there is one connection pool (with 6 available connections) that is used by both receive locations.<br /><br /> - There are two receive locations configured with same configuration values, and have the ConnectionLimit property set to different values. For example, ReceiveLocation1 property is set to 6 and ReceiveLocation2 property is set to 5. In this situation, each receive location has its own connection pool with its own available connections. ReceiveLocation1 connection pool has 6 available connections. ReceiveLocation2 connection pool has 5 available connections.|

## Frequently asked questions  
  
|Question|Answer|  
|--------------|------------|  
|What SFTP servers are supported?|See [Supported SFTP Servers](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/29940.biztalk-serverbiztalk-services-supported-sftp-servers.aspx). Starting with [!INCLUDE[bts2016_md](../includes/bts2016-md.md)], the SFTP adapter uses WinSCP to connect to SFTP. As a result, SFTP servers that support WinSCP should work.|  
|Can the SFTP Adapter be used with the mutual authentication method (public key and password)?|- Starting with **BizTalk Server 2013 R2**, yes. If set to **MultiFactorAuthentication** you must provide **Username** with its **Password** and **PrivateKey**. Additionally, if the private key is protected by a password, specify the password as well for the **PrivateKeyPassword** property.<br /><br /> - For **BizTalk Server 2013**, either **Password** or **PublicKeyAuthentication** can be used. **MultiFactorAuthentication** is not supported in the SFTP adapter shipped with BizTalk Server 2013.|  
|What private key formats are supported? Can the OpenSSH private key format be used?|The SFTP adapter supports only the PuTTY private key file format. PuTTYgen can be used to convert from OpenSSH to the .ppk format.|  
|For SSHServerHostKeyFingerPrint, which fingerprint algorithm and format should be used?|You should use the MD5 fingerprint of the server’s key in the format: `ssh-rsa 2048 90:e4:9b:67:d9:22:a7:5f:6f:33:db:6a:b1:23:96:12`.|  
|Does the SFTP adapter support 256-bit encryption?|Yes - The SFTP adapter supports 256-bit encryption. The supported encryption algorithms include:<br /><br /> - AES encryption: 256-bit, 192-bit, or 128-bit SDCTR or CBC<br /><br /> - 3DES (Triple-DES) encryption: 168-bit SDCTR or CBC|  
|What SSH versions does the adapter support?|Only SSH2. Connection cannot be established with SFTP servers having SSH1 version.|  
|Is file mask case sensitive?|No. *.txt and \*.TXT works alike. Please install the latest cumulative update for BizTalk Server 2013. BizTalk Server 2013 RTM release had case-sensitive file masks.|  
|Exporting bindings give a blank password field. When trying to create a receive location by importing these bindings what all changes are to be made?|Edit the binding file by editing the password field. Also, in `<Password vt="1">MySecretPassword</Password>`, **vt=”1”** indicates a null value. Change that to **vt=”8”**, which indicates a string. For example:<br /><br /> `<Password vt="8">MySecretPassword</Password>`<br /><br /> For more details, see [http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.runtime.interopservices.varenum(v=vs.100).aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.runtime.interopservices.varenum\(v=vs.100\).aspx)|  
|How do I specify the file paths?|Normally, paths are specified in the format `/folder/pathname`. However, different servers require different formats, with or without leading or trailing slashes. So, you can also try the following:<br /><br /> -                   `/folder/pathname`<br /><br /> -                   `/folder/pathname/`<br /><br /> -                   `folder/pathname`<br /><br /> -                   `folder/pathname/`|
