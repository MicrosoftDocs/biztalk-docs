# Interactive Mode in Orchestration Debugger
In interactive—debug—mode, the Orchestration Debugger view contains three areas: Service pane, Tracked Events pane, and the Orchestration pane. In addition, in interactive mode, the Variable list and Variable properties display across the bottom of the view.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The Orchestration Debugger cannot display the true state of the service unless it appears in Breakpoint mode and you have attached it to the instance.
