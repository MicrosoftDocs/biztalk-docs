# Viewing Live BAM Data
Following are the different ways you can view live BAM data.  
  
-   View a single activity instance (for example, Purchase Order or Loan Process) as it evolves in real-time or from the historical (archived) records. This view shows only the data relevant at the business level and hides complexity of the diverse implementation. For more information about viewing a single activity instance, see [How to View an Individual Activity](../core/how-to-view-an-individual-activity.md).  
  
-   Navigate to the related activity instances, for example, Shipments associated with given Purchase Order, or the Invoice in which it is included. For more information about navigating to related activity instances, see [How to View Related Activities and Related Documents](../core/how-to-view-related-activities-and-related-documents.md).  
  
-   Browse Aggregations (Key Performance Indicators) around all the Business Activities that are currently being processed or have already happened. The Aggregations can be done in Real-Time or can be based on a snapshot of the Activities taken at specific time. For more information about browsing aggregations, see [How to View BAM Aggregations](../core/how-to-view-bam-aggregations.md).  
  
-   Use Progress Dimensions, one of the new features in BAM. These dimensions allow filtering or grouping of the Activities at a given stage of completion. For more information about Progress Dimensions, see [Progress Dimension](../core/progress-dimension.md).  
  
-   Search for activity instances based on their progress or business data. For example, you can search for loans that are waiting for customer signature and the dollar amount is greater than a given value. For more information about searching activities in BAM, see [How to Search for Activities](../core/how-to-search-for-activities.md).
