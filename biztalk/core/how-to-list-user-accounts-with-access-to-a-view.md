# How to List User Accounts With Access to a View
Administrators use the **get-accounts** BAM Management utility command to get a list all user accounts for a view role, meaning all user accounts with access to the specified view.  
  
 For information about viewing BAM views, see [How to List BAM Views](../core/how-to-list-bam-views.md).  
  
### To list user accounts with access to a view  
  
1.  Open a command prompt as follows: Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **cmd**, and then click **OK**.  
  
2.  Navigate to [!INCLUDE[btsBiztalkServerPath](../includes/btsbiztalkserverpath-md.md)]Tracking  
  
3.  Type **bm get-accounts -View:\<view name\>**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  On a system that supports User Account Control (UAC), you may need to run the tool with Administrative privileges.  
  
4.  Press **ENTER**.
