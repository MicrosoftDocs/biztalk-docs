# SSO (BizTalk Server Samples Folder)
Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] includes two Enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) samples in its software development kit (SDK). This section provides detailed information about the functionality that the SSO samples demonstrate, instructions for building and running the samples, and the results you can expect.  
  
## In This Section  
  
-   [HTTPSSO (BizTalk Server Sample)](../core/httpsso-biztalk-server-sample.md). Demonstrates how to use Enterprise Single Sign-On with the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] HTTP adapter.  
  
-   [Manage (BizTalk Server Sample)](../core/manage-biztalk-server-sample.md). Demonstrates how to construct .xml files that you can use with the command-line utility ssomanage.exe to perform administration operations.
