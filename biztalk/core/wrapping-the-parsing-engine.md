# Wrapping the Parsing Engine
You can create your own **XmlReader** that embeds the reader returned by the **Parse** method and provides customization.  
  
## Example  
  
```  
class MyXmlReader : XmlReader  
{  
   public MyXmlReader(XmlReader xr)  
   {  
      _xr = xr;  
   }  
  
   // Overrides XmlReader and provides customized functionality of _xr  
   // ...  
}  
```
