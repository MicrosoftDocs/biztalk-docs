# Data Dimension
Defining a data dimension allows the value of some text items in the BAM activity to be used on rows or columns. For example a data dimension named Product can be used to create the following table:  
  
|Product|Count|  
|-------------|-----------|  
|Tennis racquets|100|  
|Soccer balls|200|  
  
 Also, more than one data dimension can be defined in the BAM view wizard. For example, defining a data dimension named **Location** with levels for **State** and **City** can be used to create the following table:  
  
|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|  
|-|-|-|-|  
||California||Washington|  
||Los Angeles|San Francisco|Seattle|  
|Tennis racquets|50|20|30|  
|Soccer balls|130|50|20|  
  
 In this table, the Product dimension was used as the rows, and the Location dimension was used as the columns.
