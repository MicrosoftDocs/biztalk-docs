# Installing Certificates for the WCF Adapters
The WCF adapters can use public key infrastructure (PKI) digital certificates for purposes of message encryption and decryption, message signing and verification (non-repudiation), and client authentication. This topic describes various certification usage scenarios and configuration option guidelines for using digital certificates with the WCF adapters.  

## Certificate Usage Scenarios for the WCF Receive Locations  
 The following table shows how to install the certificates for the WCF receive locations.

> [!NOTE]
>  Because the standard WCF receive adapters use the [ChainTrust](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=88960) mode to validate the client certificates, you must install the CA certificate chain for the client X.509 certificates. You can use the WCF-Custom or the WCF-CustomIsolated adapters to cange this default behavior.  

> [!NOTE]
>  For the isolated WCF receive adapters, you need to match the user account between an isolated host instance and the corresponding application pools. For more information about the BizTalk isolated hosts, see [Enabling Web Services](../core/enabling-web-services.md).  

> [!NOTE]
>  For the WCF-Custom and WCF-CustomIsolated receive locations, the user context, certificate store location, and certificate type for the certificates to install varies between the **serviceCredentials** and **clientCredentials** behavior element settings.  

> [!NOTE]
>  If the receive location uses the certificate element for the **Endpoint Identity** property, you also have to install the certificate for the published service identity into the certificate store specified in the **Endpoint Identity** property.  

> [!NOTE]
>  Instead of log on to the computer using host instance service account or administrator account, you can alternatively use Run As command with applicable accounts to perform the same action.

## Displaying the Certificates Management Console  
 To display the Certificates Management Console interface for Local Computer and Current User, perform the following steps:  

1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **MMC**, and click **OK** to open the Microsoft Management Console.  

2.  On the **File** menu, click **Add/Remove Snap-in** to display the **Add/Remove Snap-in** dialog box.  

3.  Click **Add** to display the **Add Standalone Snap-in** dialog box.  

4.  Select **Certificates** from the list of snap-ins, and then click **Add**.  

5.  Select **Computer account**, click **Next**, and then click **Finish**. This adds the Certificates Management Console interface for Local Computer.  

6.  Ensure that **Certificates** is still selected from the list of snap-ins, and then click **Add** again.  

7.  Select **My user account**, and then click **Finish**. This adds the Certificates Management Console interface for Current User.  

    > [!NOTE]
    >  This displays the Certificates Management Console for the account that you are currently logged on as. If you need to import certificates into the Personal store for a service account then you should log on with the service account credentials first.  

8.  Click **Close** in the **Standalone Snap-in** dialog box.  

9. Click **OK** in the **Add/Remove Snap-in** dialog box.
