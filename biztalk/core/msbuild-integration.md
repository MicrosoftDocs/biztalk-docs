# MSBUILD Integration
Visual Studio uses the MSBUILD project file format to store build information about managed projects including BizTalk Server projects, and you can build BizTalk projects on a computer with or without [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)]. This section gives you details over this new feature.
