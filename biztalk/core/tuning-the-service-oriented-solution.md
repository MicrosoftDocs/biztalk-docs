# Tuning the Service Oriented Solution
The orchestrations collect performance information about many parts of the application through the Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) API. You may find the data helpful in tuning the application. You can also, of course, use the built-in performance counters.  
  
 For more information about BAM, see [Using Business Activity Monitoring](../core/using-business-activity-monitoring.md). For more information about how the solution uses BAM, see [Monitoring the Service Oriented Solution with BAM](../core/monitoring-the-service-oriented-solution-with-bam.md). For more information about the BizTalk performance counters, see [Orchestration Engine Performance Counters](../core/orchestration-engine-performance-counters.md).  
  
 You can also tune the solution by adjusting values for the BizTalk host. For more information, see [How to Modify Host Properties](../core/how-to-modify-host-properties.md).
