# Implementation Highlights of the Business Process Management Solution
This section describes the implementation-related elements of the solution in greater detail. These elements include the Business Rules Framework, the number of processing stages, how the **OrderManager** communicates with the processing stages, the use of the **OrderHandler** object, and how the application uses the Ops Adapter.
