# Migrating Flat File Records
Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2000](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2000-md.md)] and Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2002](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2002-md.md)] support only single character delimiters in flat file records during parsing and serializing. This restriction is offset by greater flexibility in handling delimiters. [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2000](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2000-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2002](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2002-md.md)] also support setting different delimiters on records, fields, and subfields. In contrast, Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)] supports multi-character delimiters, although it supports only one type of delimiterâ€”child delimiter. The improvements in delimiter handling may affect how [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2000](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2000-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2002](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2002-md.md)] flat file records are handled in [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)].  
  
 Three schema annotations control delimiter handling in [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2000](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2000-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2002](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2002-md.md)], two for parsing (**skip_CR**, **skip_LF**), and one for serializing (**append_newline**). [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)] interprets these annotations as follows when migrating records:  
  
-   If the **skip_CR** annotation has a value of **true** and the current delimiter is not carriage return (0x0D), [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)] adds a carriage return to the current delimiter. For example, if the current delimiter were the pipe symbol (0x7C), the resulting delimiter is a pipe symbol followed by a carriage return (0x7C 0x0D). If the current delimiter is carriage return, it remains as a single carriage return regardless of the value of **skip_CR**.  
  
-   If the **skip_LF** annotation has a value of **true**, [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)] adds a linefeed character (0x0A) to the current delimiter. Notice that in the preceding case where the current delimiter is the pipe symbol (0x7C), a three character delimiter results (0x7C 0x0D 0x0A) if both **skip_CR** and **skip_LF** are **true**.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)] ignores the setting of the **append_newline** annotation.  
  
 While these interpretations of the annotations ensure the majority of cases migrate without difficulty, there are some cases where migration fails. For example, if **skip_CR** and **skip_LF** are both **true** and the current delimiter is the pipe symbol (0x7C), [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2000](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2000-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2002](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2002-md.md)] accept all of the following as valid delimiters within a single set of records: 0x7C 0x0D 0x0A, 0x7C 0x0D, 0x7C 0x0A, and 0x7C. Records using such sets of delimiters cannot be migrated and require custom parser code in [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)].  
  
 Although [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)] has only one type of delimiter, it interprets the old annotations so that records migrate easily. If a [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2000](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2000-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2002](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2002-md.md)] schema has values for **def_record_delimdef_field_delim**, **def_subfield_delim**, and these are referenced in **delimiter_type** as **inherit_record**, and so on, [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)] retrieves the corresponding value and stores it locally.  
  
 In addition, [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)] adds fields for tagged positional records without children.
