# How to Set Pipeline Component Properties
Each component has properties that should be configured prior to use.  
  
### To set pipeline component properties  
  
-   In the Properties window, in the **Pipeline Component Properties** section, click the **Value** cell in the **Property** row, and enter the new value. If the **Value** cell contains an arrow button, click the button for a list of choices. If the **Value** cell contains an ellipsis (**â€¦**) button, click the button to use the Schema Collection Property Editor to configure the property. For more information, see [How to Use the Schema Collection Property Editor](../core/how-to-use-the-schema-collection-property-editor.md).
