# Step 3: How to Configure a Party and Business Profile for Your Organization

![Step 3 of 9](../adapters-and-accelerators/wcf-lob-adapter-sdk/media/step-3of9.gif "Step_3of9")  
  
 In this step, you configure a party and a business profile for your organization to receive an 850 message from your trading partner and return a 997 acknowledgment message.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 You must be logged on as a member of the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administrators group.  
  
### To configure a party and business profile for your organization  
  
1. Open the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration Console by clicking **Start**, pointing to **All Programs**, pointing to **Microsoft BizTalk Server**, and then clicking **BizTalk Server Administration**.  
  
2. In the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration Console, expand [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerAdminConsoleui](../includes/btsbiztalkserveradminconsoleui-md.md)], and then expand **BizTalk Group**. Right-click **Parties**, point to **New**, and then click **Party**.  
  
3. In the **Party Properties** dialog box, enter **OrderSystem** in the **Name** field.  
  
4. Select the **Local BizTalk processes messages received by the party or supports sending messages from this party** check box. By selecting the check box you specify that the party (in this case, **OrderSystem**) also hosts BizTalk Server.  
  
5. Click **OK**.  
  
6. Right-click the party name, point to **New**, and then click **Business Profile**.  
  
7. In the **Profile Properties** dialog box, on the **General** page, enter `OrderSystem_Profile` in the **Name** text box.  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   >  When you create a party, a profile named *PartyName*_Profile is automatically created. You can use this profile instead of creating a new one. To rename a profile, right-click the profile and select **Properties**. In the **General** page, specify a name for the profile.  
  
8. Click **OK**.  
  
## Next Steps
