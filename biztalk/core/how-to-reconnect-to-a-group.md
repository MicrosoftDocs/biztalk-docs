# How to Reconnect to a Group
A group that you previously connected to your BizTalk server may sometimes appear as unavailable in the BizTalk Server Administration Console. For example, a group can become unavailable to the Administration Console when the computer where the group resides is restarted. You can reconnect to an unavailable BizTalk Server group by using **Refresh** if the group is unavailable.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure, you must be logged on as a member of the BizTalk Server Operators group or as a member of the BizTalk Server Administrators group.  
  
### To reconnect to a group  
  
1. Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerStartMenuItemui](../includes/btsbiztalkserverstartmenuitemui-md.md)], and then click **BizTalk Server Administration**.  
  
2. In the console tree, double-click [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerAdminConsoleui](../includes/btsbiztalkserveradminconsoleui-md.md)].  
  
3. Right-click the **(Unavailable)** group, and then click **Refresh**.
