## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that the receive pipeline could not process an incoming interchange because the transaction set does not start with an ST or UNH header.  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, ensure that each of the transaction sets in an interchange starts with an ST segment (for X12 interchanges) or an UNH segment (for EDIFACT interchanges), and then resubmit the interchange.
