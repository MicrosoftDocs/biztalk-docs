# What Is the SOAP Adapter?
Web services are programs with interfaces that adhere to the standards set forth in the Web Services Description Language (WSDL). You can use a Microsoft BizTalk Server orchestration to create and use Web services to combine separate but related business functions in a manageable and intuitive way. For more information about Web services and orchestration, see [Using Web Services](../core/using-web-services.md).  
  
 The BizTalk Web Services Publishing Wizard is included with [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] to speed up the development process for publishing Web services. After you create an orchestration that you want to expose as a Web service, the BizTalk Web Services Publishing Wizard generates a Web service project for you. For more information about the BizTalk Web Services Publishing Wizard, see [Publishing an Orchestration as a Web Service](../core/publishing-an-orchestration-as-a-web-service.md). Note that prior to running the BizTalk Web Services Publishing Wizard, you must enable BizTalk Web services. For more information about enabling BizTalk Web services, see [Enabling Web Services](../core/enabling-web-services.md).  
  
 The SOAP adapter consists of two adaptersâ€”a send adapter and receive adapter.
