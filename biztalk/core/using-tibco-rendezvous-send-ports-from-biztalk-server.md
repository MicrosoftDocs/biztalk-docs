# Using TIBCO Rendezvous Send Ports
A transmit port can send any kind of message. When BizTalk Server sends a message through Microsoft BizTalk Adapter for TIBCO Rendezvous, the adapter generates the message based on message context properties values, or it uses the default and sends it to the specified subject.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  According to the TIBCO Rendezvous documentation, wildcard characters are not supported in transmit subject names.  
  
## Message Handling  
 The adapter maintains a state and handles incoming BizTalk Server messages accordingly.  
  
-   If a message cannot be sent because of transport failure, BizTalk Server is instructed to resubmit later.  
  
-   If a message cannot be sent because the adapter is still initializing, the BizTalk Server message is queued. If initialization fails, BizTalk Server is instructed to resubmit later.  
  
## Message Generation  
 With the transmit adapter, BizTalk Adapter for TIBCO Rendezvous ignores the message target namespace and root element. If the adapter sends messages, it sends the payload as is. If the adapter generates a structured TIBCO Rendezvous message, the name of the root element is ignored (a message does not have a name). In every case, the adapter uses a context property to find which subject to use when publishing the message.  
  
 For more information, see [BizTalk Server Message Context Properties (Send Handlers)](../core/biztalk-server-message-context-properties-send-handlers.md) and [Data Type Mapping for Receive Handlers in TIBCO Rendezvous](../core/data-type-mapping-for-receive-handlers-in-tibco-rendezvous.md).  

## Using BizTalk to Send Messages
Microsoft BizTalk Adapter for TIBCO Rendezvous uses the asynchronous API (Transport.Send). You can specify what kind of message the adapter sends using a message context property:  
  
- **Structured**: The adapter generates a TIBRVMSG_MSG structured message, based on the XML data received from BizTalk Server. (*)  
  
  If BizTalk Server sends a message with fields that have names longer than 127 characters, BizTalk Adapter for TIBCO Rendezvous truncates the names to the maximum field name size for TIBCO Rendezvous, which is 127.  
  
  If a `reply subject name` property is provided, it is used to set the reply subject on the TIBCO Rendezvous message. It is assumed that either a receive port is set to listen for the reply and forward it to BizTalk Server, or some other TIBCO Rendezvous program is taking care of the reply.  
  
  The triplet (service, daemon, network) makes up the transport configuration. An empty (default) transport configuration results in a message being sent through the default transport object.  
  
  If the code page is left unspecified, the adapter uses UTF-8 encoding (code page 65001). Certified Messages are not supported on the transmitter side.
