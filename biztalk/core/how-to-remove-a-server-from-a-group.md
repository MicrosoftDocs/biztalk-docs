# How to Remove a Server from a Group
A server can only be associated with one BizTalk group. If a server already belongs to another group, you must first remove that server from its current group before you can add it to a new group.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure, you must be logged on as a member of the Windows Administrators group.  
  
### To remove a server from a group  
  
1.  On the computer that you want to remove from a BizTalk Server group, click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerStartMenuItemui](../includes/btsbiztalkserverstartmenuitemui-md.md)], and then click **BizTalk Server Configuration**.  
  
2.  On the menu bar, click **Unconfigure Features**.  
  
3.  In the **Unconfigure Features** dialog box, select **Group**, and then click **OK**.  
  
    > [!CAUTION]
    >  Unconfiguring a group will also unconfigure all dependent features that are already configured on that computer.  
  
4.  Click **Yes**.  
  
5.  In the Microsoft BizTalk Server Configuration Wizard, click **Next**.  
  
     The Group and its dependent features are unconfigured.  
  
6.  Click **Finish**.
