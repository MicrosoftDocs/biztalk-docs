# Import Binding Files

## Overview
Before you use [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] to import a binding file, verify the following:  
  
-   The CLASSPATH is pointing to a specific location for the PeopleSoft-specific files. Verify that the location of these files is the same on the new computer—or edit the binding file.  
  
-   The folders for the responses must exist and be identical on the new computer—or edit the binding file.  
  
-   PeopleSoft Enterprise system passwords, if present in the configuration, are saved as ***** in the binding file. 
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Deployment overwrites receive location configuration. When you deploy a binding file and assembly on a target computer, the send ports and receive locations are replaced with those in the XML binding file when they are imported.  
  
 For step-by-step directions about importing binding files, see the topic "How to Import Bindings into a BizTalk Group" in the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] documentation.  
  
## Clean the Target Computer  
To clean the target computer for deploying the new application, remove send ports and receive locations bound to the orchestration.  
  
If you do not have Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] installed on the target computer, you may remove the ports by running these scripts:  
  
**\<Microsoft BizTalk Server\>\SDK\Samples\Admin\WMI\Remove Send Port\VBScript\RemoveSendPort.vbs**  
  
**\<Microsoft BizTalk Server\>\SDK\Samples\Admin\WMI\Remove Receive Port\VBScript\RemoveReceivePort.vbs**  
  
For example, at a command prompt, run:  
  
**cscript RemoveSendPort.vbs \<Send port name\>**
