The BAM Management utility activity management commands allow you to work with deployed activities.  
  
-   get-activities: Gets a list of deployed activities.  
  
-   remove-activity: Removes an activity.  
  
-   get-activitywindow: Gets the duration for an activity.  
  
-   set-activitywindow: Sets the activity duration for an activity.  
  
-   get-index: Gets the list of indexes.  
  
-   create-index: Creates a new index.  
  
-   delete-index: Deletes an index.  
  
-   get-archive: Gets the behavior of archived activity.  
  
-   set-archive: Sets the behavior of archived activity.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can enable tracing on any BAM utility command by including the **-Trace:on&#124;off** parameter switch. Using the Trace switch overrides the tracing settings in the configuration file. The switch can be used in conjunction with any normal BAM command.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  On a system that supports User Account Control (UAC), you may need to run the tool with Administrative privileges.
