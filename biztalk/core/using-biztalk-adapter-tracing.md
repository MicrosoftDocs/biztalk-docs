# Using BizTalk Adapter Tracing
This topic describes how to install the Trace Log tool and how to enable BizTalk adapter tracing.

## Install the Trace Log Tool

#### To install the Trace Log tool (tracelog.exe)

1. Download the Trace Log tool from the [Microsoft® Windows® Software Development Kit Update for Windows Vista](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=128279) Web site.

   > [!NOTE]
   >  Install this version (6.0) of the SDK even if you are running [!INCLUDE[btsWinSvr2k8](../includes/btswinsvr2k8-md.md)]. If you install the **Windows SDK for Windows Server 2008 and .NET Framework 3.5** version (v. 6.1), it will not install the Trace Log tool.

2. Start the **Microsoft® Windows® Software Development Kit Update for Windows Vista** Web installation program by clicking the link for the **PSDK-x86.exe** file at the bottom of the Web page.

   > [!NOTE]
   >  If you are using a 64-bit version of Windows choose the correct files to download for your system.

3. In the **Select an Installation Type** dialog box, choose the option for a **Custom** installation, and then click **Next**.

4. Accept the default installation location and then click **Next**.

5. In the **Custom Installation** dialog box, click to clear all the available features.

6. Expand the **Microsoft Windows Core SDK** feature, and then expand the **Tools** feature.

7. Choose the **Tools (Intel 64-bit)** feature, and then click **Will be installed on local hard drive**.

8. Click **Next**, and then click **Next** again to start the installation.

   > [!NOTE]
   >  After installing the **Microsoft® Windows® Software Development Kit Update for Windows Vista** you may be prompted to reboot depending upon what other features you chose to install along with the Trace Log tool. This is because certain components of the **Microsoft® Windows® Software Development Kit Update for Windows Vista** will not function correctly until the reboot has been completed. You do not need to reboot to use the Trace Log tool.

## Enable BizTalk Adapter Tracing with trace.cmd

#### To enable BizTalk adapter tracing

1. At a command prompt, change the current directory to the directory where BizTalk Server is installed. By default, BizTalk Server is installed in the [!INCLUDE[btsBiztalkServerPath](../includes/btsbiztalkserverpath-md.md)] directory.  If using a 64-bit version of Windows and BizTalk Server, the installation path is [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerPathx64](../includes/btsbiztalkserverpathx64-md.md)].

2. Type the following command, and then press ENTER:

    **trace -tools "Path of the Trace Log tool"**

    By default, the Trace Log tool (tracelog.exe) is located in the **C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0\Bin** directory. If using a 64-bit version of Windows the Trace Log tool is located at **C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0\Bin**.  You must enclose the path of the Trace Log tool in quotation marks.

    For example, type the following command, and then press ENTER:

    **trace -tools "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0\Bin"**

   > [!NOTE]
   >  The **-tools** switch indicates to the Trace.cmd file the location of the Tracelog.exe file.
   >
   >  If the command successfully runs, the output will be like below:
   >
   >  **trace 2.0 - Manage BizTalk 2006 Release Bits Tracing.**
   >
   >  **Setting TRACE_TOOL_SEARCH_PATH to "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0\Bin "**

## Capture Trace output with trace.cmd

#### To capture trace output

1. At a command prompt, change the current directory to the directory where BizTalk Server is installed.

2. At a command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:

    **trace -start**

3. Reproduce the scenario for which you want to capture trace output.

4. At a command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:

    **trace -stop**

5. After you stop the trace, a binary file that is named **Btstrace.bin** is generated in the folder where [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] is installed.

6. Send the **Btstrace.bin** file to Microsoft Product Support Services for analysis.
