# How to Remove a Send Port from a Send Port Group
This topic describes how to use the BizTalk Server Administration console to remove a send port from a send port group. When you do this, the send port is not deleted from the application or the BizTalk Management database.  
  
 Before you can remove a send port, it must be in a stopped or unenlisted state.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  To route messages, a send port group must contain at least one send port.
