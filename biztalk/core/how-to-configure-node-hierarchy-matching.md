# How to Configure Node Hierarchy Matching
When you create a link in a map, the BizTalk Mapper automatically creates compiler links to implement the link you have drawn. The **Target Links** property of a link controls how the BizTalk Mapper draws the compiler links. This topic provides information about how to set the target links.  
  
 The **Source Links** property specifies how a value is retrieved from the source node and applied to the destination node. For information about how to set source links, see [How to Set the Source Links Compiler Value](../core/how-to-set-the-source-links-compiler-value.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This operation requires that BizTalk Mapper is running.  
  
### To set the Target Links property  
  
1. On the map grid page, click a link to which you want to set the target links property.  
  
2. In the [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)]**Properties** window, set the **Target Links** property to one of the following choices:  
  
   -   **Flatten Links.** The hierarchy in the source record node is flattened to the linked-to-record node in the destination schema.  
  
       > [!NOTE]
       >  By default, the BizTalk Mapper sets the **Target Links** property to **Flatten**.  
  
   -   **Match Links Top Down.** Node matching is performed level-to-level from the top down.  
  
   -   **Match Links Bottom Up.** Node matching is performed level-to-level from the bottom up.
