## Explanation  
 This Error event indicates that SSO has re-established contact with the SSO database, but was unable to read the replay file because of corruption. If SSO cannot open a replay file, it will proceed to the next replay file (if there is one).  

 Replay files are used by password sync when the ENTSSO server cannot contact the SSO database. A progress file indicates how far through SSO was able to read the replay file in-case contact with the SSO database is again lost.  

## User Action  
 To resolve this error, do the following:  

- Check System and Application event logs for associated events.  

- Delete the replay file.
