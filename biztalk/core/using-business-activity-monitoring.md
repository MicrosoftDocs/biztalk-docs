# Using Business Activity Monitoring
Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) provides visibility into business processes independent of your IT environments and across a heterogeneous IT implementation. This distinguishes BAM from operational monitoring such message and instance monitoring. A key aspect of BAM is being able to view business data in as close to real time as possible, referred to as zero latency.  
  
 Before you begin, you should be familiar with the information in [Business Activity Monitoring](../core/business-activity-monitoring.md).
