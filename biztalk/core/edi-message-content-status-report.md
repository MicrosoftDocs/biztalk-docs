# EDI Message Content Status Report

## Overview
This status report displays the headers and payload of a transaction set. You display this report by right-clicking a transaction set within the Transaction Set Details status report, and then clicking **View Transaction Set Content**.  
  
 This report is available only if you have selected the **Store transaction set/payload for reporting** property in the General Page of the EDI Properties dialog box for the related party.  
  
 This report provides two views of the content:  
  
-   A Text Format view that shows the contents of the transaction set in human-readable form, as in an EDI text file. This view shows the ST header, the transaction set payload, and the SE trailer, with each segment on a separate line.  
  
-   A Binary Format view that shows the contents of the transaction set in non-delimited text format and a table of the hexadecimal representations for each ASCII character in the transaction set.
