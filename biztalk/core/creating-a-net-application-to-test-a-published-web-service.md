# Creating a .NET Application to Test a Published Web Service
To test your published Web service, you can create an ASP.NET Web client application that consumes your published Web service. The [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] Help Collection contains a valuable walkthrough for creating an ASP.NET Web client application. You can use the walkthrough to test your published Web service.

 The walkthrough creates an ASP.NET Web client application, adds a Web reference, and provides sample code to show you how to access your published Web service. The walkthrough takes you through running the application in debug mode.

 For information and procedures about creating an XML Web service client project, see "Walkthrough: Accessing an XML Web Service Using Visual Basic or Visual C#" in the [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] Help Collection at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=62263](/previous-versions/xb5th1ba(v=vs.90)). You can replace the Web service used in this example, TempConvert1, with a BizTalk published Web service.
