# High Availability using SQL Server Always On Availability Groups
Configure high availability using SQL Server AlwaysOn availability groups.

> [!TIP] 
[Setting up BizTalk Server 2016 using availability groups LAB](https://skastberg.wordpress.com/2017/02/22/setting-up-my-biztalk-server-2016-using-availability-groups-lab/) provides a step-by-step guide written by a Microsoft field engineer. It is based on a lab environment, and includes some observations. Check it out.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * Always On Availability Groups is available starting with SQL Server 2016. If you are using a previous SQL Server version, this topic does not apply to you. 
> * BizTalk Server 2016 supports synchronous-commit mode; asynchronous-commit mode is not supported. For disaster recovery, it is recommended to configure the Backup BizTalk Server job, and use log shipping. See [Backing Up and Restoring BizTalk Server Databases](../core/backing-up-and-restoring-biztalk-server-databases.md) for specific details.
> 
>    [Availability Modes](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/availability-groups/windows/availability-modes-always-on-availability-groups) details the commit options with Always On Availability Groups. 


## Background and history

BizTalk Server relies heavily on SQL Server for data persistence. Other components and hosts in BizTalk Server have specific roles when integrating disparate business applications, such as receiving, processing, or routing messages. The database computer captures this work, and persists it to disk. 

BizTalk uses SQL Server Failover Clustering and Log Shipping to provide high availability, backup and restore, and disaster recovery for its on-premises databases. In Azure IaaS (Azure virtual machines), previous versions of SQL Server do not support Failover Cluster Instances (no MSDTC support). As a result, BizTalk did not have a HA solution when using Azure VMs.

Starting with SQL Server 2016, SQL Server AlwaysOn Availability Groups supports MSDTC for on-premises and using Azure VMs. As a result, the SQL Server 2016 AlwaysOn feature is supported for BizTalk databases on-premises or in Azure IaaS scenarios. 

## SQL Server 2016 AlwaysOn Availability Groups 
Deploying AlwaysOn Availability Groups requires a Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) cluster. Each availability replica of a given availability group must reside on a different node of the same WSFC cluster. A WSFC resource group is created for every availability group that you create. The WSFC cluster monitors this resource group to evaluate the health of the primary replica.  

The following illustration shows an availability group that contains one primary replica and four secondary replicas.  
 
 ![SQLAG_PrimaryReplica](../core/media/sqlag-primaryreplica.png)

Clients can connect to the primary replica of a given availability group using an availability group listener. An availability group listener provides a set of resources that are attached to a given availability group to direct client connections to the appropriate availability replica. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
> SQL Server 2016 supports MSDTC with AlwaysOn Availability Groups (AG) on Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2012 R2. **Windows Server 2012 R2** requires  the [3090973](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3090973) Windows hotfix  to be installed. 
> **Windows Server 2016** requires that the [RemoteAccessEnabled registry key](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3182294) be enabled.

SQL Server does not support MSDTC with AlwaysOn AG for any versions prior to 2016.  

MSDTC between databases on same SQL Server instance is not supported with SQL Server AlwaysOn Availability Groups. This means that no two BizTalk databases in a distributed transaction can be hosted on the same SQL server instance. For transactional consistency, BizTalk databases participating in distributed transaction should be hosted on different SQL server instances. Note that it does not matter whether SQL instances are on the same computer, or different computers.  


## Providing high availability for BizTalk databases using AlwaysOn Availability Groups 
In the basic configuration of BizTalk Server, a minimum of 9 databases are created including Rules and BAM databases. Due to the MSDTC limitation with Availability Groups mentioned previously, a configuration such as following does not ensure transactional consistency. 

![SQLAG_NoTrans](../core/media/sqlag-notrans.gif)
 
We recommend that the BizTalk Server databases are grouped into the following four SQL Server instances:
 
| Instance |Role |BizTalk Databases in that group  |
|--- | --- | ---|
|1 |Authentication |SSODB|
|2 |Management |BizTalkMgmtDb| 
|3 |Runtime |BizTalkMsgBoxDb<br/> BizTalkRulesEngineDb<br/> BAMPrimaryImport<br/>BAMStarSchema <br/>BAMAlertsApplication |
|4 |Tracking |BizTalkDTADb<br/>EsbItineraryDb<br/>EsbExceptionDb | 
 
In a scaled-out MessageBox scenario (a configuration with more than one MessageBox), there is more than one MessageBox database, and each MessageBox database must be on its own SQL Server instance. 

BizTalk Server also depends on SQL Server Analysis Services and SQL Server Integration Services for BAM Analysis and Archiving. SQL Server does not provide a high availability solution for Integration Services or Analysis Services in Azure IaaS. It is therefore recommended to use another standalone SQL Server instance for the BAMArchive and BAMAnalysis Analysis Services databases. For on-premises installations, SQL Failover Clustering Instance can be used for setting up a high availability configuration. 

This configuration is illustrated below, and recommended for BizTalk Databases in Availability Groups:  

![SQLAG_Recommended](../core/media/sqlag-recommended.png)
 
Along with SQL Server databases, BizTalk Server configuration also creates SQL Server security logins and SQL Agent Jobs. AlwaysOn Availability Groups only provide the ability to manage databases inside an Availability Group. Logins and SQL Agent Jobs for BizTalk need to be created and updated/managed manually on all the availability replicas.  

The following list of SQL Server security logins are associated with BizTalk Server. You may have additional logins created for your BizTalk Server applications. If so, you need to replicate them on every instance of SQL Server hosting a replica of BizTalk databases. 

1. BizTalk Application Users (one or more corresponding to each in-proc Host) 
2. BizTalk Isolated Host Users (one or more corresponding to each Isolated Host) 
3. BizTalk Server Administrators 
4. BizTalk Server B2B Operators 
5. BizTalk Server Operators 
6. SSO Administrators 
7. BAM Alerts User 
8. BAM Management Web Service User 
9. Rule Engine Update Service Account 

If you have created additional hosts or will create additional hosts later, there will be new SQL logins created as part of this process. You must make sure to create these SQL logins manually on the corresponding replicas.

The following SQL Server Agent jobs are associated with BizTalk Server. The jobs installed on each server are different depending on which features are installed and configured. Most of these jobs are created during BizTalk Server configuration. Several are created when configuring log shipping. These jobs need to be replicated on each instance of SQL Server hosting replica of their corresponding BizTalk database. This must be performed manually. 

- BizTalkMgmtDb jobs: 
	- Backup BizTalk Server (BizTalkMgmtDb) 
	- CleanupBTFExpiredEntriesJob_BizTalkMgmtDb 
	- Monitor BizTalk Server (BizTalkMgmtDb) 
- BizTalkMsgBoxDb jobs: 
	- MessageBox_DeadProcesses_Cleanup_BizTalkMsgBoxDb 
	- MessageBox_Message_Cleanup_BizTalkMsgBoxDb MessageBox_Message_ManageRefCountLog_BizTalkMsgBoxDb MessageBox_Parts_Cleanup_BizTalkMsgBoxDb 
	- MessageBox_UpdateStats_BizTalkMsgBoxDb 
	- Operations_OperateOnInstances_OnMaster_BizTalkMsgBoxDb 
	- PurgeSubscriptionsJob_BizTalkMsgBoxDb 
	- TrackedMessages_Copy_BizTalkMsgBoxDb 
- Jobs on additional msgboxes
- BizTalkDTADb job: 
	- DTA Purge and Archive (BizTalkDTADb) 
- BizTalkRulesEngineDb job: 
	- Rules_Database_Cleanup_BizTalkRuleEngineDb 
- BAMAlertsApplication job: 
	- 0 or more DelAlertHistJob 

Unlike SQL Failover Clustering Instances, in Availability Groups all replicas are active, running, and available. When SQL Agent jobs are duplicated on each replica for failover, they run against the corresponding replica, irrespective of whether it is currently in primary role or secondary role. To make sure these jobs are executed only on the current primary replica, every step in every job must be enclosed within an IF block, as shown: 

	IF (sys.fn_hadr_is_primary_replica(‘dbname’) = 1)  
	BEGIN  
	…  
	END
  
Replace `‘dbname’` with the corresponding database name against which the job is configured to run. The following example shows this change for TrackedMessages_Copy_BizTalkMsgBoxDb on BizTalkMsgBoxDb: 
 
 ![SQLAG_AgentJob](../core/media/sqlag-agentjob.gif)

### Configure BizTalk Server when Availability Groups are already set up

1. Check your OS requirements: 
* On all **Windows Server 2012 R2** computers, install the [3090973 MSDTC hotfix](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3090973) (opens a KB article)
* On all **Windows Server 2016** computers, enable the [RemoteAccessEnabled registry key](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3182294) (opens a KB article)
2. Make sure to have at least four different SQL instances which will host the various BizTalk databases. The secondary replicas should also be set up on different SQL instances. This results in a minimum of 8 SQL instances (1 primary and 1 secondary replica for each of the 4 instances), and a minimum of 4 Availability Groups. See the above illustration for this Availability Group configuration. Make sure Availability Groups are created with the **Per Database DTC Support** option as this cannot be changed later. 
3. When configuring BizTalk Server and specifying the SQL server name, use the Availability Group’s listener name instead of the actual machine name. This creates the BizTalk databases, logins, and SQL Agent jobs on the current primary replica. 
4. Stop BizTalk processing (Host Instances, SSO Service, IIS, Rules Engine Update Service, BAMAlerts Service, and so on), and stop the SQL Agent Jobs. 
5. Now add BIzTalk databases to the respective Availability Groups. 
6. Enclose body of SQL Agent job steps within `IF` block (mentioned previously) to make sure they run only if the target is the primary replica. 
7. Script Logins and SQL Agent Jobs to replicate them on corresponding replica. 
8. Replicate SQL DBMail Profile and Account for BAM Alerts on corresponding SQL instances hosting the secondary replica. 
9. If you are adding an additional message box database or deploying a new BAM activity/view later, then new SQL jobs are created for new message box databases or BAM Alerts database on the current primary replica. Make sure to edit it on primary replica, and then create them manually on the corresponding secondary replicas. 

This configuration can also be done using the SQL Instances hosting the primary replica. In this case, after the BizTalk configuration, run the `UpdateDatabase.vbs` and `UpdateRegistry.vbs` scripts on the BizTalk machines after the above steps. This is discussed in more detail in the next section.  
 
### Move BizTalk Server databases of an existing BizTalk system to Availability Groups

1. Check your OS requirements: 
* On all **Windows Server 2012 R2** computers, install the [3090973 MSDTC hotfix](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3090973) (opens a KB article)
* On all **Windows Server 2016** computers, enable the [RemoteAccessEnabled registry key](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3182294) (opens a KB article)
2. Make sure to have at least four different SQL instances which will host the various BizTalk databases. The secondary replicas should also be set up on different SQL instances. This results in a minimum of 8 SQL instances (1 primary and 1 secondary replica for each of the 4 instances), and a minimum of 4 Availability Groups. See the above illustration for this Availability Group configuration. Make sure Availability Groups are created with **Per Database DTC Support** option as this cannot be changed later.  
3. Stop BizTalk processing and SQL Agent Jobs. 
4. Perform full backup of all BizTalk Databases. 
5. Restore BizTalk databases on the SQL instances currently in the primary role in the Availability Group. 
6. Script Logins and SQL Agent jobs on corresponding SQL Instances currently in the primary role in the Availability Group.  
7. Run the `UpdateDatabase.vbs` and `UpdateRegistry.vbs` scripts on the BizTalk machines using the following steps. Enter the Availability Group Listener as the new server name in the input update info xml.  
	1. Stop all BizTalk services and Enterprise SSO services on BizTalk Server. Stop SQL Agent Service on SQL Server. 
	2. On BizTalk Server, edit SampleUpdateInfo.xml in the following folder: 
 
		32-bit computer: `%SystemRoot%\Program Files\Microsoft BizTalk Server 20xx\Schema\Restore`
 
		64-bit computer: `%SystemRoot%\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft BizTalk Server 20xx\Bins32\Schema\Restore`
 
			1. Replace "SourceServer" with the source server name (old SQL Server hosting old databases).  
			2. Replace "DestinationServer" with the name of the destination server, which should be the availability group listener name.  
			3. If you have the BAMAnalysis, BAM databases or RuleEngineDB, uncomment the appropriate sections. 

	3. Open a command prompt, and go to: 
 
		32-bit computer: `%SystemRoot%\Program Files\Microsoft BizTalk Server 20xx\Schema\Restore` 
 
		64-bit computer: `%SystemRoot%\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft BizTalk Server 20xx\Bins32\Schema\Restore` 
 
		At the command prompt, run:  
	`cscript UpdateDatabase.vbs SampleUpdateInfo.xml`  
 
		Run UpdateDatabase.vbs on only one server in the BizTalk group. 

	4. Copy the edited SampleUpdateInfo.xml file to the following folder on every BizTalk Server computer in this BizTalk group: 
 
		32-bit computer: `%SystemRoot%\Program Files\Microsoft BizTalk Server 20xx\Schema\Restore` 
 
		64-bit computer: `%SystemRoot%\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft BizTalk Server 20xx\Bins32\Schema\Restore` 
 
	5. On each computer in the BizTalk Server group, open a command prompt, and go to: 
 
		32-bit computer: `%SystemRoot%\Program Files\Microsoft BizTalk Server 20xx\Schema\Restore`
 
		64-bit computer: `%SystemRoot%\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft BizTalk Server 20xx\Bins32\Schema\Restore` 
 
		At the command prompt, run:  
	`cscript UpdateRegistry.vbs SampleUpdateInfo.xml` 
 
		Run UpdateRegistry.vbs on every server in the BizTalk group. 
 
8. Now move the databases to their respective Availability Groups. 
9. Replicate the SQL DBMail Profile and Account for BAM Alerts on the SQL instances hosting the replica of the BAMAlerts database. 
10. Enclose the body of SQL Agent job steps within an IF block to make sure they run only if the target is the primary. 
11. Script Logins and SQL Agent Jobs to replicate them on the corresponding replica. The UpdateDatabase script also updates the server name in the Operations_OperateOnInstances_OnMaster_BizTalkMsgBoxDb and TrackedMessages_Copy_BizTalkMsgBoxDb jobs. So script the SQL Agent Jobs only after running the UpdateDatabase script. 

## Requirements 
* BizTalk Server 2016 Enterprise
* SQL Server 2016 Enterprise
* Windows Server 2012 R2
* Windows Server 2016 

### Availability Group Listener configured with non-default port (1433) 
Use SQL alias on BizTalk Server machines. 

### Supporting Availability Group Multi-Subnet Failovers 
BizTalk Server uses Microsoft OLE DB for database connections, which does not support the **MultiSubnetFailover** connection option. BizTalk Server does not support the `MultiSubnetFailover (=TRUE)` connection option, and this may cause higher recovery time during multi-subnet failover. 

### Read-Only Routing 
Read-only routing refers to the ability of SQL Server to route incoming connections for an availability group listener to a secondary replica that is configured to allow read-only workloads. 

BizTalk does not use Read-Only Routing for any of the connections to its databases. This means the “Readable Secondary” option on Availability Replicas in the availability group does not have any impact on BizTalk database connections. 

### Behavior of BizTalk Server Host Instances during SQL Server Failover 
If the SQL Server availability group experiences a failover, the BizTalk Server databases on the availability group are temporarily unavailable. 

#### Behavior of In-Process Host Instances during SQL Server Failover 
If the BizTalk Server databases are unavailable, then an in-process instance of a BizTalk Server host is recycled until the connection to the SQL Server is restored. Once the connection to the SQL Server databases is restored, document processing resumes normally.
 
#### Behavior of Isolated Host Instances During SQL Server Failover 
If the BizTalk Server databases are unavailable, then an isolated instance of a BizTalk Server host pauses, and an error similar to the following is generated in the BizTalk Server Application log: 

	All receive locations are being temporarily disabled because either the MessageBox or Configuration database is not available. When these databases become available, the receive locations will be automatically enabled.
 
Once the connection to the SQL Server databases is restored, an informational message similar to the following is written to the BizTalk Server Application log, and then document processing resumes normally: 

	All receive locations are being enabled because both the MessageBox and Configuration databases are back online.

#### BizTalk Server Log Shipping for Disaster Recovery 
BizTalk Server implements database standby capabilities through the use of database log shipping. BizTalk Server log shipping automates the backup and restore of databases and their transaction log files, allowing a standby server to resume database processing in the event that the production database server fails. 

**Secondary databases in availability group are not backups.** Continue to backup BizTalk databases and their transaction logs using BizTalk Server Log Shipping jobs. The way BizTalk Log Shipping is implemented ensures that backups are always performed against the current primary replica of every database. The backup preference setting on the availability group is not honored by the BizTalk Server Log Shipping jobs. 

If you are adding other BizTalk databases to the BizTalk Databases Backup job, be sure to use the Availability Group Listener name as the database server for them when setting up the Backup.

## Known limitations 

These limitations are for BizTalk Server, SQL Server AlwaysOn Availability Group, and Azure Virtual Machines. These limitations may or may not get addressed in future. 

* Logins, SQL Agent Jobs, the SQL DB Mail profile, and accounts are not managed within Availability Groups. This requires manual modification in Jobs to make sure they run against the primary replica. 
* SQL Server Analysis Services and SQL Server Integration Services do not participate in Availability Groups. Without this support from SQL Server, there is no HA solution for these in Azure Virtual Machines. BizTalk Server’s BAM capabilities are dependent on these services. 
* Availability Groups does not support MSDTC between databases on the same SQL instance. Therefore, a minimum 8 SQL instances are required to configure BizTalk. 
* To address MSDTC limitations with Availability Groups, BizTalk databases can be configured using a minimum of two servers hosting four SQL instances each. However, in Azure Virtual Machines, ILB does not support multiple IP addresses. This forces us to create each instance of SQL on a separate server. 
* BizTalk Server cannot use Read-Only Routing. 
* BizTalk Server does not set the `MultiSubnetFailover` connection property. 
* BizTalk Backup Jobs using Log Shipping will always target the primary replica irrespective of the backup preference set on the Availability Group.
