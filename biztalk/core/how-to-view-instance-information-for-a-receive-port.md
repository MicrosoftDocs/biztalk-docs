# How to View Instance Information for a Receive Port
This topic describes how to use the BizTalk Server Administration console to view the service instances for a receive port. Each time the receive port receives a message, a service instance is created to process the message. When you follow the procedure in this topic, instance information displays in the Group Overview page for the receive port.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform the procedure in this topic, you must be logged on with an account that is a member of the BizTalk Server Administrators group.

1. Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerStartMenuItemui](../includes/btsbiztalkserverstartmenuitemui-md.md)], and then click **BizTalk Server Administration**.  
  
2. In the console tree, expand the BizTalk group and the BizTalk application for which you want to view instance information for a receive port.  
  
3. Click **Receive Ports**, select the receive port, click **View**, and then click **Instance Information**.  
  
    The query results panel in the lower section of the page displays all instances of the receive port.
