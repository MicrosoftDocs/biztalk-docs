# How to Refresh a Resource
This topic describes how to use the BizTalk Server Administration console to refresh a resource artifact. This updates the artifact information in the BizTalk Management database. Another way to do this is by adding the artifact to the application using the BTSTask [AddResource Command](../core/addresource-command.md) with the overwrite option.  
  
 Resource artifacts are contained in an application's Resources folder. You might want to refresh a resource artifact if you make changes to the source file and want to replace the file in the application with the updated file.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform the procedure in this topic, you must be logged on with an account that is a member of the BizTalk Server Administrators group. For more detailed information on permissions, see [Permissions Required for Deploying and Managing a BizTalk Application](../core/permissions-required-for-deploying-and-managing-a-biztalk-application.md).  
  
### To refresh a resource artifact  
  
1. Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerStartMenuItemui](../includes/btsbiztalkserverstartmenuitemui-md.md)], and then click **BizTalk Server Administration**.  
  
2. In the console tree, expand **BizTalk Server Administration**, expand the BizTalk group containing the resource artifact to refresh, and then expand the application containing the artifact.  
  
3. Click the **Resources** folder, right-click the file to refresh, and then click **Modify**.  
  
4. In the **Modify Resources** dialog box, select the file to refresh, and then click **Refresh**.  
  
5. Browse to the updated file with which you want to replace the current file, and then click **OK**.  
  
    The current file is replaced with the updated file. In addition, the configuration, settings displayed on the **Options** tab of the **Modify Resources** dialog box are applied to the refreshed file. For more information about changing these settings, click **Help** in the dialog box.
