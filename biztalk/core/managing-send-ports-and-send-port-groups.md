# Manage Send Ports and Send Port Groups

## Overview
This section provides instructions on using the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console to create, configure, and manage send ports and send port groups in a BizTalk application. A send port specifies the location to which messages are sent and optionally responses are received. Any time a message is sent to a send port, a new instance of the send port service is created, which is called a *service instance*.  
  
 A send port group is a logical grouping of send ports. When a message is sent to a send port group, it is routed to all of the associated send ports.  For background information about send ports and send port groups, see [Send Ports and Send Port Groups](../core/send-ports-and-send-port-groups.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can use Microsoft Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Object Model to create and run scripts that automate administrative tasks. For information about using WMI, see the **WMI Class Reference** [!INCLUDE[ui-guidance-developers-reference](../includes/ui-guidance-developers-reference.md)].
> 
> [!NOTE]
>  While developing a BizTalk application, the developer can use BizTalk design tools in [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)], such as Orchestration Designer, to create and configure send ports and send port groups. For more information, see [Using Ports in Orchestrations](../core/using-ports-in-orchestrations.md).
