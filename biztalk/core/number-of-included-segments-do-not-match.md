|Message Text|Number of included segments do not match|  
  
## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that the number of segments in the transaction set of the X12 interchange does not equal the number in the transaction set trailer (SE01 field). This occurs when the interchange is preserved and the interchange is suspended on an error.  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, make sure that the number in the SE01 field of the interchange trailer is the same as the number of segments in the transaction set, and then resend the interchange.
