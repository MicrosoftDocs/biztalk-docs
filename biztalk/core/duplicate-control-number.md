## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that the EDI receive pipeline could not process an incoming interchange because it had the same interchange, group, or transaction set control number as a previously received interchange. This will result in a failure as long as the appropriate duplicate control number checks are enabled.  

## User Action  
 To resolve this error, do one of the following:  

- Ensure that the interchange sent to BizTalk Server does not have the same interchange, group, or transaction set control number as a previous interchange, if the corresponding duplicate control number check is enabled.  

- Disable the duplicate control number check. In the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration Console, right-click the appropriate party, and open either the EDIFACT Interchange Processing Properties or the X12 Interchange Processing Properties dialog box for the party as an interchange sender. To disable a check for an EDIFACT interchange, clear the Check for duplicate UNB5 (Interchange control number), Check for duplicate UNG5 (Group control number) in interchange, or Check for duplicate UNH1 (Transaction set reference number) in group property. To disable a check for an X12 interchange, clear the Check for duplicate ISA13 (Interchange control number), Check for duplicate GS6 (Group control number) in interchange, or Check for duplicate ST2 (Transaction set control number) in group property.
