# How to Define Durations
Duration specifies the amount of time, defined by a beginning and ending milestone for a particular activity item. For example, the number of days a PO is valid.  
  
 Use the BAM View wizard to set or modify durations. Before you can set durations, use the BAM Activity wizard to create business activities and items. For more information about using the wizard, see [Define Business Activities and Views in Excel](../core/defining-business-activities-and-views-in-excel.md).  
  
### To define durations  
  
1.  In the BAM View wizard, click **Next** until you see the second **Edit BAM View: View Items** page, and then click **New Duration**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  You must have at least two milestones or groups before you can create a duration.  
  
2.  Type a name for **Duration Name**.  
  
3.  From the drop-down list, select **Start business milestone**, **End business milestone**, **Time Resolution** and then click **OK**.
