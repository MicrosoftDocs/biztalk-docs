# How to Use the BAM Add-In for Excel
To use the BAM Add-in for Excel template to define a BAM view, follow the steps in this procedure.  
  
 This procedure assumes you have already opened Excel.  
  
### To define a BAM view  
  
1.  On the tool bar click the **BAM** menu item and the click **BAM Activity** and define your activity.  
  
     For more information about creating an activity, see [Defining a Business Activity](../core/how-to-define-a-business-activity.md).  
  
2.  On the **BAM** menu, click **BAM View**.  
  
3.  In the **Business Activity Monitoring View Wizard**, click **Next** to continue.  
  
4.  On the **BAM View** page, verify that **Create a new view** is selected, and click **Next**.  
  
5.  On the **New BAM View: Name and Activities** page, in the **View Name** box, type a descriptive name.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >  Do not use **BizTalkOrchestration** as a view name. This name is reserved in another part of BAM.  
  
6.  In the list of activities, select the check boxes for each activity you want to include in the BAM view you are currently defining, and then click **Next**.  
  
7.  On the **New BAM View: View Items** page, select the check boxes for each activity item you want to include in the BAM view you are currently defining, and click **Next**.
