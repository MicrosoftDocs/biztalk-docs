## Explanation  
 The ENTSSO system usually checks for updates on the ENTSSO database every 30 seconds. If the database is unavailable for a specified time (usually five minutes), the system itself goes offline. In this state the system will not respond to requests for credentials. Some offline and administrative activities are still possible.  
  
## User Action  
 This error indicates that the ENTSSO database is offline. You should investigate immediately.
