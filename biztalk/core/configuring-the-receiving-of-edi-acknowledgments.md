# Configuring the Receiving of EDI Acknowledgments
In [!INCLUDE[prague](../includes/prague-md.md)], with the introduction of bi-directional agreement, you can set up receiving of an acknowledgement in the same agreement that you configure for sending an acknowledgement. You do so by specifying properties in the different one-way agreement tabs. For information on how to configure receiving of an acknowledgement, see [Configuring the Sending and Receiving of EDI Acknowledgments](../core/configuring-the-sending-and-receiving-of-edi-acknowledgments.md).
