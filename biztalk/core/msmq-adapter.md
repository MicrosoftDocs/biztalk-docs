# MSMQ Adapter
The MSMQ adapter lets you use Message Queuing 4.0 from [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)]. Integrating Message Queuing technology with BizTalk Server enables applications that are running at different times to communicate across heterogeneous networks and systems that may be temporarily offline.  
  
 The MSMQ adapter features include the following:  
  
-   Improved performance  
  
-   Support for multithreaded operations  
  
-   Support for Message Queuing 4.0 features, including support for remote transactional reads and receiving from subqueues (available with Message Queuing 4.0).  
  
-   Support for processing messages larger than 4 MB
