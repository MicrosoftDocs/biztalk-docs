# Rule Engine
This section describes several components, functionalities, and operations of the Business Rule engine. The rule engine provides the execution context for a rule set. The **RuleEngine** object uses the following plugâ€“in components for implementation:  
  
-   **Ruleset executor (inference engine)**. Implements the algorithm responsible for rule condition evaluation and action execution. The default rule set executor is a discrimination network-based forward-chaining inference engine designed to optimize in-memory operation.  
  
-   **Ruleset translator**. Takes as input a **RuleSet** object and produces an executable representation of the rule set. The default in-memory translator creates a compiled discrimination network from the rule set definition.  
  
-   **Rule set tracking interceptor**. Receives output from the rule set executor (inference engine) and forwards it to rule set tracking and monitoring tools.
