# How to Open a Saved Tracking Query
You can open a message or service instance query against live tracking data (currently running service instances and messages). This is done by using the Query tab on the Group Hub page from within the BizTalk Server Administration Console.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 You must be logged on as a member of the BizTalk Server Administrators group to perform this procedure.  
  
### To open a saved query  
  
1. Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerStartMenuItemui](../includes/btsbiztalkserverstartmenuitemui-md.md)], and then click **BizTalk Server Administration**.  
  
2. On the **Group Hub** page, under the **New Query** tab, click **Open Query**.  
  
3. Click the query you want, and then click **Open**.  
  
4. If a security warning displays the first time you open a query, optionally check **Don't show this message again** to prevent it from occurring again. Click **Yes** to continue.
