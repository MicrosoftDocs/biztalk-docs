## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates BizTalk Server was unable to compare a context property while trying to decide to Batch a message.  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, ensure that the filter provided in Active batches doesn’t specify a context property which has an CSD type that can’t be bitwise compared.
