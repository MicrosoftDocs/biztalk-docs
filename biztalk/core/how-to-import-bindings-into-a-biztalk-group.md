# How to Import Bindings into a BizTalk Group
This topic describes how to use the BizTalk Server Administration console or the command line to import bindings into a BizTalk group from an .xml file. For instructions on exporting the bindings from a BizTalk group into an .xml file that you can import, see [How to Export Bindings for a BizTalk Group](../core/how-to-export-bindings-for-a-biztalk-group.md).  
  
 You can also import bindings into a BizTalk application, as described in [How to Import Bindings into a BizTalk Application](../core/how-to-import-bindings-into-a-biztalk-application.md).  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform the procedures in this topic, you must be logged on with an account that is a member of the BizTalk Server Administrators group. For more detailed information on permissions, see [Permissions Required for Deploying and Managing a BizTalk Application](../core/permissions-required-for-deploying-and-managing-a-biztalk-application.md).  
  
## To import bindings into a BizTalk group  
  
#### Using the BizTalk Server Administration console  
  
1.  Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerStartMenuItemui](../includes/btsbiztalkserverstartmenuitemui-md.md)], and then click **BizTalk Server Administration**.  
  
2.  In the console tree, expand  **BizTalk Server Administration**, expand the BizTalk group, and then right-click **Applications**.  
  
3.  Point to **Import**, and then click **Bindings**.  
  
4.  Click the binding file and click **Open**.  
  
     The artifacts in the binding file are written to the group. They display in appropriate folders of the \<All Artifacts\> node.  
  
#### Using the command line  
  
1.  Open a command prompt as follows: Click **Start**, click **Run**, type `cmd`, and then click **OK**.  
  
2.  Type the following command, substituting the appropriate values, as described in the following table:  
  
     **BTSTask ImportBindings /Source:** *value* **/GroupLevel** [**/Server:***value*] [**/Database:***value*]  
  
     For example, the following command imports bindings into the group defined in the BizTalk Management database running on a SQL Server instance named MyServer.  
  
     **BTSTask ImportBindings /GroupLevel /Server:MyServer /Database:BiztalkMgmtDb /Source:C:\Bindings\Binding1.xml**  
  
    |Parameter|Value|  
    |---------------|-----------|  
    |**/Source**|Full path of the binding file to import, including the file name. Paths that include spaces must be enclosed in quotation marks (").|  
    |**/GroupLevel**|Option to import the binding file into the current group.|  
    |**/Server**|Name of the SQL Server instance hosting the BizTalk Management database, in the form ServerName\InstanceName,Port.<br /><br /> Instance name is only required when the instance name is different than the server name. Port is only required when SQL Server uses a port number other than the default (1433).<br /><br /> Examples:<br /><br /> Server=MyServer<br /><br /> Server=MyServer\MySQLServer,1533<br /><br /> If not provided, the name of the SQL Server instance running on the local computer is used.|  
    |**/Database**|Name of the BizTalk Management database. If not specified, the BizTalk Management database running in the local instance of SQL Server is used.|
