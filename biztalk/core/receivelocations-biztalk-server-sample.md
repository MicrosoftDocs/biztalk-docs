# ReceiveLocations (BizTalk Server Sample)
The ReceiveLocations sample demonstrates how to create receive locations in the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] environment by using the **ExplorerOM** administration objects. For more information about receive locations in general, see [Receive Locations](../core/receive-locations.md).  
  
## Prerequisites  
  
-   You must have [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] administrative privileges to use the administrative objects in this sample.  
  
-   The Windows PowerShell script requires the Windows PowerShell execution policy to allow script execution. For more information see [Examining the Execution Policy](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=128930).  
  
## What This Sample Does  
 This sample demonstrates using the **ExplorerOM** administrative classes to create and configure receive ports and receive locations. A Windows PowerShell example script is also included in this topic. The sample performs the following operations:  
  
-   Create a new receive port named “My Receive Port”.  
  
-   Create a new receive location associated with the new port and configured to use the HTTP transport protocol.  
  
-   This sample also contains example procedures to delete and enumerate receive ports and locations.  
  
## Where To Find This Sample  
 This sample is located in the following SDK location:  
  
 \<*Samples Path*\> \Admin\ExplorerOM\ReceiveLocations  
  
 The following table shows the files in this sample and describes their purpose.  
  
|File(s)|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|ReceiveLocations.cs|[!INCLUDE[btsVCSharp](../includes/btsvcsharp-md.md)] source file for the operations demonstrated in this sample.|  
|ReceiveLocations.sln and ReceiveLocations.csproj|Solution and project files for this sample.|  
  
## Building and Running This Sample  
  
#### To build this sample  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)], open the solution file ReceiveLocations.sln.  
  
2.  On the **Build** menu, click **Build Solution**.  
  
#### To run this sample  
  
1.  Open a command prompt with [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] administrative privileges.  
  
2.  Change to the \<*Samples*\>\Admin\ExplorerOM\ReceiveLocations\bin\debug directory.  
  
3.  Run ReceiveLocations.exe.  
  
4.  View the new receive port and receive location with the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console.  
  
## Windows PowerShell Script Example  
 The following PowerShell example script demonstrates the same operations as the [!INCLUDE[btsVCSharp](../includes/btsvcsharp-md.md)] version. Make sure the script execution policy has been properly configured as mentioned in the requirements section of this topic.
