|Message Text|The certificate used to decrypt a message has been revoked. Certificate thumbprint: {0}|  
  
## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that the receive pipeline could not process the incoming message because the certificate to be used to decrypt the message has been revoked.  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, do one of the following:  
  
-   Create a new certificate to replace the revoked certificate. Add the certificate to the Current User/Personal certificate store, and then send the public key of the certificate to the sending of the AS2 message.  
  
-   Disable the revocation list check by opening the BizTalk Server Administration Console, opening the AS2 Properties dialog box for the party resolved for the outgoing message, clicking the General node, and then clearing the Check Certification Revocation List property.
