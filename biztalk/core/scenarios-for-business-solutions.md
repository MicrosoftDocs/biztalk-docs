# Scenarios for Business Solutions
This section describes two complete, model BizTalk applications. Each application represents a particular business pattern and demonstrates other constituent integration patterns.  
  
 Each section presents an overview of the application, a developer's guide that describes the patterns and design decisions reached in the course of developing the application, and deployment information for building and running the application.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The patterns and guidance documented in these sections are intended to illustrate an approach to a particular kind of business solution. Patterns are simple mechanisms that are meant to be applied to a specific problem and are usually combined with other patterns. They are not meant to be plugged into an application. Example code is provided "as is" and is not intended for production use. It is only intended to illustrate the pattern and therefore does not include extra code, such as exception handling, logging, security, and validation. Microsoft does not support deploying the example code "as is" to production.
