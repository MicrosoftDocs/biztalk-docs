## Explanation  
 When creating an application at the API level, you specified the number of fields (i.e. UserID, Password) the application would define. Each field that has been defined must also be created. This warning message lists the application name, number of fields defined, and number of fields created.  
  
## User Action  
 Determine which fields were defined but not created, and then go back and create them.
