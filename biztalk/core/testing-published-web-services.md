# Testing Published Web Services
As you develop your Web service, you may want to test it by republishing your Web service. Each time you republish your Web service, you must reset Internet Information Services (IIS).  
  
 You can test your published Web service by creating a Web service client application or by using a browser such as Internet Explorer.
