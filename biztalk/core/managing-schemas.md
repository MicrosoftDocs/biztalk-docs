# Manage Schemas

## Overiew
This section provides instructions on using the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console to manage schemas. Schemas are used by pipelines and orchestrations to represent the message that will be processed.  
  
 Schemas are created in [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] and compiled into BizTalk assemblies. You cannot add a schema to an application individually; a schema is added to an application as follows:  
  
- When you add a BizTalk assembly containing a schema to the application, as described in [How to Add a BizTalk Assembly to an Application](../core/how-to-add-a-biztalk-assembly-to-an-application.md).  
  
- When you import an .msi file into an application that includes a BizTalk assembly containing a schema, as described in [How to Import a BizTalk Application](../core/how-to-import-a-biztalk-application.md).  
  
- When a developer deploys into an application an assembly containing a schema from [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)], as described in [Deploying BizTalk Assemblies from Visual Studio into a BizTalk Application](../core/deploying-biztalk-assemblies-from-visual-studio-into-a-biztalk-application.md).  
  
  For background information about schemas, see [Schemas](../core/schemas.md). For information about developing schemas, see [Creating Schemas Using BizTalk Editor](../core/creating-schemas-using-biztalk-editor.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can use Microsoft Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Object Model to create and run scripts that automate administrative tasks. For information about using WMI, see the **WMI Class Reference** [!INCLUDE[ui-guidance-developers-reference](../includes/ui-guidance-developers-reference.md)].
