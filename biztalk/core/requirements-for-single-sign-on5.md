# Requirements for Single Sign-On
To use Single Sign-On (SSO), you must have:  
  
-   Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)]  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../includes/vs2010-md.md)]  
  
-   Enterprise Single Sign-On  
  
-   A Server System that supports SSO  
  
 The isolated host should be configured as authentication trusted.  
  
### To enable SSO  
  
1.  In the **Transport Properties** window, select **Yes** for **Use SSO**.  
  
2.  Select an appropriate affiliate application when specifying transport properties.  
  
     For information about creating affiliate applications, see [Creating Affiliate Applications](../core/creating-affiliate-applications3.md).  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  After performing work using SSO, remember to reset any **Web-Sharing** folder to **Do not share**. Applications using that folder will not update or uninstall correctly if the folder is shared because it is considered to be in use.
