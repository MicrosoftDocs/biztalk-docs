# CorrelationID
The `CorrelationID` element is used to specify a correlation ID for a message.  
  
## Format  
 The `CorrelationID` element consists of an `Expression` element that uses one or more `Operation` elements to specify the string to use as the correlation ID.  
  
```  
<ic:CorrelationID>  
  <ic:Expression>  
    <!-- Operations -->  
  </ic:Expression>  
</ic:CorrelationID>  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 The following common operations are not allowed in correlation ID expressions:  
  
-   And  
  
-   Equals  
  
## Example  
 The following Workflow Foundation (WF) interceptor sample configuration block uses "OrderNum" to establish a correlation ID. Using the WF and common operations, you can build sophisticated expressions to construct an appropriate correlation ID for your workflow.  
  
```  
<ic:CorrelationID>  
  <ic:Expression>  
    <wf:Operation Name="GetWorkflowProperty">  
      <wf:Argument>OrderNum</wf:Argument>  
    </wf:Operation>  
  </ic:Expression>  
</ic:CorrelationID>  
```  
  
 For Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) applications, you can use WCF-specific and common operations to construct a correlation ID. The following sample uses the **XPath** operation and XPath to retrieve a credit card number from a message for use as a correlation ID:  
  
```  
<ic:CorrelationID>  
  <ic:Expression>  
    <wcf:Operation Name ="XPath">  
      <wcf:Argument>//s:Body/creditCard:CreditCardNumber</wcf:Argument>  
    </wcf:Operation>  
  </ic:Expression>  
</ic:CorrelationID>  
```
