# How to Configure Password Synchronization
Use the SSOCONFIG command line utility to configure your password synchronization settings.  
  
### To specify the directory for replay files  
  
1.  On the **Start** menu, click **Run**.  
  
2.  In the **Run** dialog box, type **cmd**, and then click **OK**.  
  
3.  At the command line, go to the Enterprise Single Sign-On installation directory. The default is \<drive\>:\Program Files\Common Files\Enterprise Single Sign-On.  
  
4.  Type **ssoconfig -replayfiles \<replay files directory\> &#124; -default** and press Enter.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Replay files are not deleted when you change the service account. If you change this account, you will need to delete the replay files manually.  
  
#### To display or change maximum password synchronization age  
  
1.  On the **Start** menu, click **Run**.  
  
2.  In the **Run** dialog box, type **cmd**, and then click **OK**.
