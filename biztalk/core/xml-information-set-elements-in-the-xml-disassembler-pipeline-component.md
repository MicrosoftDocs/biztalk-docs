# XML Information Set Elements in the XML Disassembler Pipeline Component
The XML Disassembler handles XML information set elements as follows.  
  
|Element|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|comment|Comments are preserved in the document; however, any comments in XML envelopes are not preserved.|  
|CDATA|CDATA is preserved in the document. CDATA elements appearing outside of a document (for example, in an envelope) are not preserved.|  
|processing instructions|The XML Disassembler preserves processing instructions appearing in or before an XML document. Processing instructions appearing after an XML document or before or after an envelope are not preserved.|  
|XML declaration|The XML declaration element of any incoming XML message is removed.|
