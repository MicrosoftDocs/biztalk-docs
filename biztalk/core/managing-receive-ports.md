# Manage Receive Ports

## Overview
This section describes how to create, configure, and manage receive ports for a BizTalk application by using the BizTalk Server Administration console. A receive port is logical grouping of similar receive locations. For background information on receive ports, see [Receive Ports](../core/receive-ports.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can use Microsoft Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Object Model to create and run scripts that automate administrative tasks. For information about using WMI, see the **WMI Class Reference** [!INCLUDE[ui-guidance-developers-reference](../includes/ui-guidance-developers-reference.md)].
