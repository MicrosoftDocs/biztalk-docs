# SSO Security in BizTalk Adapter for TIBCO Rendezvous

## Overview
Microsoft BizTalk Adapter for TIBCO Rendezvous provides Single Sign-On (SSO) support. An affiliate application created by Enterprise Single Sign-On tools represents a server system such as TIBCO Rendezvous. 
  
> [!CAUTION]
>  It is highly recommended that you restrict the use of BizTalk Adapter for Enterprise Applications to authorized users only, because the client files directly connect to the line-of-business applications.
