# Deploying Ports and Assemblies
Using [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], you can duplicate ports and assemblies on a target computer. [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] exports the send ports/receive location configuration into an XML file.  
  
 You use the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] to perform these tasks:  
  
- Deploy or remove [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] assemblies in a BizTalk Configuration database.  
  
- Install or uninstall the assemblies in the global assembly cache (GAC).  
  
- Import or export [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] assembly binding information to and from binding files.  
  
  For information about how to use [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] to deploy ports and assemblies, see [How to Export Bindings for a BizTalk Application](../core/how-to-export-bindings-for-a-biztalk-application.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The Microsoft BizTalk Adapter for PeopleSoft Enterprise only requires that you have Visual Studio on a source (development) computer. Visual Studio is not required on the production computer.
