# Nodes That Provide Wildcard Capabilities
BizTalk Editor provides a direct mapping to the XSD concepts that provide wildcard character capabilities for elements and attributes. The **Any Element** node maps directly to the XML Schema definition (XSD) language **any** element and the **Any Attribute** node maps directly to the XSD **anyAttribute** element. The remainder of this section provides additional information about these nodes.
