# How to Delete Schemas
Sometimes you might want to not only exclude a schema from its BizTalk project, but also completely remove the schema from your hard disk. This is known as deleting, as opposed to excluding, a schema. This topic describes the steps required to delete a schema.  
  
### To delete a schema  
  
1.  In Solution Explorer, right-click the schema that you want to delete, and then click **Delete**.  
  
2.  In the confirmation dialog box, click **OK**.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Deleted schemas are permanently removed from the file system, so proceed cautiously and back up your files regularly.
