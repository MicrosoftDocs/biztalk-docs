## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that the receive pipeline could not process the incoming X12 interchange because a segment in the interchange does not repeat the minimum number of times required by the document schema.  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, have the sender of the interchange as repetition of the segment so that it repeats at least the minimum number of times required by the document schema, and then resend the interchange.
