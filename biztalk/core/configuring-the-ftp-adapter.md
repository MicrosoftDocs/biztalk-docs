# Configuring the FTP Adapter


## Before you begin
- The FTP adapter supports reading and writing data from a secure FTP server. The adapter provides support for file transfer from an FTP server over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Level Security (TLS).
- The FTP adapter supports downloading of files from read-only file locations.
- The FTP adapter supports atomic file transfer for ASCII mode also.

See [Best practices and recommendations for the FTP adapter](../core/best-practices-and-recommendations-for-the-ftp-adapter.md).


## Configure the receive location

You can set FTP receive location adapter properties in the BizTalk Server Administration console. If properties are not set in the receive location, then the default receive handler values in the BizTalk Server Administration console are used.

> [!NOTE]
>  Before completing the following procedure, you must have already added a receive port. See [How to Create a Receive Port](../core/how-to-create-a-receive-port.md).
> 1.  In the BizTalk Server Administration console, expand **BizTalk Server Administration**, expand **BizTalk Group**, expand **Applications**, and then expand the application in which you want to create a receive location.

2. In the left pane, click the **Receive Ports** node. In the right pane, right-click the receive port that is associated with an existing receive location or that you want to associate with a new receive location, and then click **Properties**.

3. In the **Receive Port Properties** dialog box, in the left pane, select **Receive Locations**. In the right pane, double-click an existing receive location or click **New** to create a new receive location.

4. In the **Receive Location Properties** dialog box, in the **Transport** section next to **Type**, select **FTP** from the drop-down list and then click **Configure**.

5. In **FTP Transport Properties**, do the following:

   **Batch**

   |Use this|To do this|
   |--------------|----------------|
   |**Maximum Files**|Specify the maximum number of files per BizTalk Server batch.<br /><br /> Zero (0) indicates no limit.<br /><br /> **Default value:** 0|
   |**Maximum Size**|Specify the maximum number of bytes per BizTalk Server batch.<br /><br /> Zero (0) indicates no limit.<br /><br /> **Default value:** 0|

   |   **Temporary Folder**   |  Specify the location for a temporary folder. You use this location to guarantee recovery from a transfer failure.                                                |


6. Click **OK** to save settings.

7. In the **Receive Location Properties** dialog box, enter the appropriate values to complete the configuration of the receive location and then click **OK** to save settings. For information about the **Receive Locations Properties** dialog box, see [How to Create a Receive Location](../core/how-to-create-a-receive-location.md).

> [!NOTE]
>  Do not configure multiple FTP receive locations to poll the same FTP URL. If multiple FTP receive locations are polling the same URL concurrently then each receive location can receive a copy of the file, which can cause data duplication. This behavior occurs because the FTP protocol has no provision for locking files when reading them from the target URL.
>
>  To provide high availability for the FTP receive adapter, you should configure the FTP receive adapter to run in a clustered BizTalk Host instance. See [Considerations for Running Adapter Handlers within a Clustered Host](../core/considerations-for-running-adapter-handlers-within-a-clustered-host1.md).

## Configure the send port

You can set FTP send port adapter properties in the BizTalk Server Administration console. If properties are not set for the send port, the default send handler values in the BizTalk Server Administration console are used.

1. In the BizTalk Server Administration console, create a new send port or double-click an existing send port to modify it. See [How to Create a Send Port](../core/how-to-create-a-send-port2.md). Configure all of the send port options, and in the **Transport** section of the **General** page, specify **FTP** for the **Type** option.

2. On the **General** page, in the **Transport** section, click the **Configure** button next to **Type**.

3. In **FTP Transport Properties**, do the following:

4. Click **OK** and **OK** again to save settings.


## FTP commands required by the FTP adapter
The FTP adapter is subject to the limitations of the FTP protocol, and requires that certain FTP commands are available on the source or destination FTP Server.

The FTP adapter operates as an FTP client and may require that the following commands are available on the FTP server to function correctly:


| Command  |  Required by Receive  |  Required by Send  |
|---|---|---|
|   SYST   | ✔ <br/><br/>Optional starting with [!INCLUDE[bts2016_md](../includes/bts2016-md.md)] | ✔<br/><br/>Optional starting with [!INCLUDE[bts2016_md](../includes/bts2016-md.md)] |

## Configuring an FTP Adapter to Work with Legacy Hosts

This sections addresses what you need to know to facilitate communication between the FTP adapter and a mainframe computer.
> [!NOTE]
>  You cannot use the temporary folder function when sending files to an MVS or AS400 host. Input into this field is not supported and will cause errors.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The following information is provided as a guide and should not be substituted for information found in AS400 or IBM documentation.

## MVS
 To send files to an FTP server on a mainframe, the mainframe must support IBM Generation Data Group (GDG). In the name field, each file name will append a (+1) to the destination file name (a full path with quotes around it).

## AS400
 There are three methods of naming files and defining their paths when transferring files to and from an AS400 system:

-   **Filename field**: When sending a file to an FTP server, enter the file name in the **Filename** field. The file name must conform to the file-naming conventions of the AS400 system because the file will be stored in the Library File System.

-   **Quote command**: Use the Quote command to run a script on the remote computer. Enter the Quote command into the **Before GET**, **Before PUT**, **After GET**, and **After PUT** fields on any of the endpoints. Enter the Quote command in the following format:

    ```
    QUOTE RCMD <command to be run on the remote system>.
    ```

-   **Integrated File System (IFS)**: IFS is an area on the AS400 system that allows the storage of PC-based files and therefore the same naming conventions as a PC. To use the IFS instead of the default Library File System, the first command to enter is `quote site namefmt 1`. This command tells the AS400 system to use the IFS naming convention.
