# Interchange Aggregation Report
This report provides one record that indicates the number of EDI interchanges that share the same EDI encoding type, sender party, receiver party, and direction. This report does not provide details about the individual interchanges.  
  
 This status report is displayed by clicking the Interchange Aggregation Report link at the bottom of the Group Hub page in the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration Console.  
  
## Fields in the Status Report  
 The Interchange Aggregation Report displays the following information for each record:  
  
- A count of how many interchanges share the same EDI encoding type, sender party, receiver party, and direction  
  
- The Sender Party for each interchange in the record  
  
- The Receiver Party for each interchange in the record  
  
- The Direction (receive or send) of each interchange in the record  
  
- The date and time at which the earliest interchange in the time range was sent or received (Earliest Started Date/Time)  
  
  > [!NOTE]
  >  For received documents, if the date specified in the interchange is YYMMDD format and YY is greater than or equal to 75, [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] will display the year as 19YY. If the date is less than 75, it will be displayed as 20YY.  
  > 
  >  For example, if you receive an interchange that contains the value 991113 in ISA09, the Earliest Started Date/time will be listed in the report as 11/13/1999.  
  
- The date and time at which the latest interchange in the time range was sent or received (Latest Ended Date/Time)  
  
- The EDI encoding type for each interchange in the record
