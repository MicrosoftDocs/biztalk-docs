## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that the X12 interchange failed cross-field validation in the receive pipeline or the send pipeline. This indicates that the X12ConditionDesignator_Check flag is set to "Yes", and that at least one element in the interchange failed a rule identified by the prefix "X12ConditionDesignatorX".  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, do one of the following:  
  
-   Identify which data element failed a cross-field validation rule. Contact the sender of the interchange and indicate that the rule must be followed when creating the interchange.  
  
-   Open the schema for the interchange, and set the X12ConditionDesignator_Check flag for the data element that failed validation to "No".
