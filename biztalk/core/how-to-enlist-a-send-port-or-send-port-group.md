# How to Enlist a Send Port or Send Port Group
This topic describes how to use the BizTalk Server Administration console to enlist a send port or send port group. Enlisting a send port or send port group associates the send port or send port group with a BizTalk host and creates the subscriptions for the send port or send port group. If a send port group does not contain a send port, enlisting the send port group does not create any subscriptions. In addition, enlisting a send port group does not change the state of any send ports that it contains.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Starting a send port or send port group also automatically enlists it. In addition, by default starting an application enlists and starts all of its artifacts. For more information, see [How to Start a Send Port or Send Port Group](../core/how-to-start-a-send-port-or-send-port-group.md). Also see [How to Start and Stop a BizTalk Application](../core/how-to-start-and-stop-a-biztalk-application.md).
