# How to Search for All Service Instances
You can use the **Query** tab in the BizTalk Server Administration Console to search for all service instances. You cannot unenlist a specific service type if there are any running or suspended instances. For example, before you can unenlist a specific service type, you can search for all service instances to ensure that there are no running or suspended instances.  

> [!NOTE]
>  When Grouping and Filtering by URI, only send and receive ports are displayed in the results. Grouping and Filtering by URI is not possible for orchestrations, which are not included in the displayed results.  

## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure, you must be logged on as a member of the BizTalk Server Operators group.  

### To search for all service instances  

1. Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerStartMenuItemui](../includes/btsbiztalkserverstartmenuitemui-md.md)], and then click **BizTalk Server Administration**.  

2. In the console tree, expand [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerAdminConsoleui](../includes/btsbiztalkserveradminconsoleui-md.md)], and then click the BizTalk group.  

3. In the details pane, click the **New Query** tab.  

4. In the **Query Expression** group, in the **Value** column, select **All In-Progress Service Instances** from the drop-down list box.  

5. In the **Field Name** column, in the empty drop-down list box next to the asterisk (`\`), select one or more of the following:

   |   **Maximum Matches**   |               The number of matches to display (required). This is usually set to 50, the default.<br /><br /> When you include Group Results By, this displays the number of groups, not the total number of records.               |
   |    **Service Class**    |                                                 You can search for isolated adapters; messaging; messaging, and isolated adapters; MSMQT; Orchestration; or Routing Failure Report.                                                  |

   |   **Service Type ID**   |                                                                                    You can group or filter service instances by service type ID.                                                                                     |
