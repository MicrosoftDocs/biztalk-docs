# How to Terminate Suspended Orchestration Instances
You can terminate any suspended orchestration instances or ports from the Query results or preview pane in the BizTalk Server Administration Console.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Each instance of an ordered delivery a send port may have several messages associated with it. To prevent accidental termination or data loss, be sure you have reviewed all such associations before terminating an instance.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 You must be logged on as a member of the BizTalk Server Operators group to perform this procedure.  
  
### To terminate suspended orchestration instances  
  
1.  Click **Start**, click **Programs**, click [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerStartMenuItemui](../includes/btsbiztalkserverstartmenuitemui-md.md)], and then click **BizTalk Server Administration**.  
  
2.  In the console tree, expand [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerAdminConsoleui](../includes/btsbiztalkserveradminconsoleui-md.md)], and then click the BizTalk group.  
  
3.  In the details pane, click the **New Query** tab.  
  
4.  In the **Query Expression** group, in the **Value** column, select **Suspended Service Instances** from the drop-down list box.  
  
5.  Do one of the following:  
  
    -   To terminate a single instance, in the **Field Name** column, in the empty drop-down list box next to the asterisk (**\***), select the **Service Name** filter and then in the **Value** column, specify the service name.  
  
    -   To terminate instances in bulk, in the **Field Name** column, in the empty drop-down list box next to the asterisk (**\***), select **Group Results By** and then in the **Value** column, specify the service name.  
  
6.  Click **Run Query**.  
  
7.  In the query results list, right-click the orchestration instance or group of instances you want to terminate, and then click **Terminate Instance** or **Terminate Instances**.
