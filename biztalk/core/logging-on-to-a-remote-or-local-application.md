# Logging on to a Remote or Local Application
After you finish setting affiliate credentials for your user, you can use Enterprise Single Sign-On service (ENTSSO) to provide access to applications. If the user is local, you can use ENTSSO to retrieve credentials for a non-Windows application. In contrast, if the user is remote, you can use ENTSSO to retrieve credentials for a local application.
