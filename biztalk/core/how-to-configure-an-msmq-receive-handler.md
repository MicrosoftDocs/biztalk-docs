# How to Configure an MSMQ Receive Handler
Use the following procedure to change the host with which the MSMQ receive handler is associated.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Each host can associate with only one receive handler.  
  
### To change the host with which the MSMQ receive handler is associated  
  
1.  In the BizTalk Server Administration console, expand **BizTalk Server Administration**, expand **BizTalk Group**, expand **Platform Settings**, and then expand **Adapters**.  
  
2.  In the expanded adapter list, click **MSMQ**, in the right pane, right-click the receive handler that you want to configure, and then click **Properties**.  
  
3.  In the **Adapter Handler Properties** dialog box, on the **General** tab, in the **Host Name** list, select the host with which the receive handler will be associated.  
  
4.  Click **OK**.
