## Status Definitions  
 The status values used in EDI status reports have the following definitions:  
  
- Accepted: Valid interchange  
  
- Accepted with Errors: Errors were noted in segments  
  
- Sent: The interchange was sent successfully  
  
- All: Display a message with any of the other values  
  
- Ack Expected  
  
  > [!NOTE]
  >  The Interchange Status field in the Interchange Status and ACK Details status report will be set to "Ack Expected" for an outbound message when the message is sent if [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] expects a technical acknowledgment. This occurs if the **TA1 Expected** property is set in **Acknowledgements** page for the one-way agreement tab. The status will be changed to “Accepted” when the technical acknowledgment has been received and validated. Note that this only occurs for a technical acknowledgment, not a functional acknowledgment.  
  
- Ack Not Expected  
  
- Rejected: The interchange was invalid due to errors.
