# Using the Flat File Serializing Engine
The flat file serializing engine is invoked by calling the **Serialize** method of the **IFFDocumentSpec** interface. By providing a customized **XmlReader** as the argument to the method, you can control the final data that gets serialized. Data could be in any format, or could simply be a reader created of off an XmlDocument.  
  
## Example  
  
```  
Stream stm = docspec.Serialize(new MyXmlReader(originalXmlReader), Encoding.Unicode);  
```
