|  Message Text   |      Password sync server (for MIIS) access denied.%r      |
  
## Explanation  
 MIIS Callback access has been denied. The most likely cause of this error is failure to use the Kerberos authentication between the ENTSSO system and MIIS.  
  
## User Action  
 Confirm that your ENTSSO system is using Kerberos authentication. For more information, see [SSO Security Recommendations](../core/sso-security-recommendations.md).
