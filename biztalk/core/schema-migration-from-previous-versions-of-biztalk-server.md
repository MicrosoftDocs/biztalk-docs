# Schema Migration from Previous Versions of BizTalk Server
This version of BizTalk Server uses XML Schema definition (XSD) language to represent message schemas, while previous versions used the XML-Data Reduced (XDR) syntax to represent message schemas. If you are migrating from a previous version of BizTalk Server, you must convert your schemas to use XSD rather than XDR.  
  
 You need to perform the following tasks to convert a BizTalk schema from XDR syntax to XSD syntax:  
  
- Change the extension of the schema file from.xdr to.xsd.  
  
- Add the renamed schema to the appropriate BizTalk project.  
  
- Convert the renamed schema from XDR to XSD by opening the schema in BizTalk Editor.  
  
- Make the conversion permanent by saving the schema.  
  
  For detailed information about how to perform these steps, see [How to Migrate XDR Schemas to XSD Schemas](../core/how-to-migrate-xdr-schemas-to-xsd-schemas.md).
