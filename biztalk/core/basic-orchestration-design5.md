# Basic Orchestration Design
When you create a basic orchestration in BizTalk Adapter for PeopleSoft Enterprise, you receive XML into the receive port of your orchestration. The XML is then sent to the back-end system to be processed. In the back-end system, an exception might occur that would stop the orchestration and generate a fault. The fault that is produced provides information that the orchestration was not completed. This is not helpful in debugging the cause of the error.

Exception handling  
  
 When a fault occurs the call is suspended. In the Auditing log, the call is set to FAILED. When you right-click FAILED in the Auditing log, the failed call opens a pop-up message. When you click the reporting selection, you are shown the fault and the reason for the failure from the back-end system.  
  
 To prevent the orchestration from entering a suspended state and to redirect the fault, you can create a CatchExpression. To trap the exception generated by the back-end, and to help in locating the cause of the fault, you can use the Scope shape in your orchestration.
