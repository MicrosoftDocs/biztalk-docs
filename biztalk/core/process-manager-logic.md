# Process Manager Logic
This section describes how the process manager, the **OrderManager** orchestration, processes orders. It describes key fields in the various order messages and follows new and updated orders through the orchestration.  
  
 The **OrderManager** orchestration coordinates subordinate orchestrations to process the order. You can add, delete, or modify these stages without having to change the **OrderManager**. The **OrderManager** does much of the coordination through custom messages defined by .NET classes. For a list of all messages in the solution, see [Message Reference for the Business Process Management Solution](../core/message-reference-for-the-business-process-management-solution.md). For information about defining message types with .NET classes, see [Constructing Messages in User Code](../core/constructing-messages-in-user-code.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Because of the size and scope of **OrderManager**, you may want to read these sections, especially the second, with the orchestration open in Microsoft Visual Studio.
