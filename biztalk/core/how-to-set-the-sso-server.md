# How to Set the SSO Server
Each time you use ssomanage, you must first point the user to the Single Sign-On server you want to connect to.  
  
 You can do this in one of two ways:  
  
-   Individual users can point themselves to the correct Single Sign-On Server.  
  
-   A local computer administrator for the Single Sign-On server can point all the members of the Single Sign-On Users account to this server.  
  
### To set the Enterprise Single Sign-On Server using the MMC Snap-In  
  
1.  Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Microsoft Enterprise Single Sign-On**, and then click **SSO Administration**.  
  
2.  In the MMC Snap-In under the **Console Root**, right-click **Enterprise Single Sign-On**, and click **Select**.  
  
3.  Browse to the desired server.  
  
4.  If appropriate, select the **Set SSO Server for all users** check box.  
  
5.  Click **OK**.  
  
### To set the Enterprise Single Sign-On Server for a single user using the command line  
  
1.  On the **Start** menu, click **Run**, and then type **cmd**.  
  
2.  At the command line prompt, go to the Enterprise Single Sign-On installation directory. The default installation directory is **\<drive\>**:\Program Files\Common Files\Enterprise Single Sign-On.  
  
3.  Type **ssomanage –server \<SSO server name\>**, where **\<SSO server name\>** is the computer name of the Single Sign-On Server the user wants to connect to.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  On a system that supports User Account Control (UAC), you may need to run the tool with Administrative privileges.  
  
### To set the Enterprise Single Sign-On Server for all users using the command line  
  
1.  On the **Start** menu, click **Run**, and then type **cmd**.  
  
2.  At the command line prompt, go to the Enterprise Single Sign-On installation directory. The default installation directory is **\<drive\>**:\Program Files\Common Files\Enterprise Single Sign-On.  
  
3.  Type **ssomanage –serverall \<SSO server name\>**, where **\<SSO server name\>** is the computer name of the Single Sign-On Server all members of the Single Sign-On Users account will be pointed to.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  On a system that supports User Account Control (UAC), you may need to run the tool with Administrative privileges.  
  
### To determine the Enterprise Single Sign-On Server to which a user is connected using the command line  
  
1.  On the **Start** menu, click **run**, and then type **cmd**.  
  
2.  At the command line prompt, go to the Enterprise Single Sign-On installation directory. The default installation directory is **\<drive\>**:\Program Files\Common Files\Enterprise Single Sign-On.  
  
3.  Type **ssomanage –showserver**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  On a system that supports User Account Control (UAC), you may need to run the tool with Administrative privileges.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This command displays the settings for the current user as well as for other users if they exist.
