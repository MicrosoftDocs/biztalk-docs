# How the TPE Works
To troubleshoot a specific customer order or analyze trends of specific business events and milestones in the shipping process, for example, a business analyst can specify the view of the data he wants to see. To extract the data the business analyst requires, the developer uses TPE to perform the mapping between the specific business event data and the actual orchestration. After you create, save, test, and deploy the tracking profile, the business analyst can retrieve the data collected to analyze a specific aspect of a business process.
