## Explanation  
 This error indicates the interchange does not contain the delimiter set values.  

## User Action  
 To resolve this error, do one of the following:  

- Add delimiter set values to the interchange, as follows:  

  1.  Open up the message.  

  2.  Determine whether there is a UNA segment in the interchange. If there is not a UNA segment, ask the partner to add the UNA segment to the interchange.  

- Enter the delimiter values to the EfactDelimiters pipeline property, as follows:  

  1. In [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration Console, right-click the receive location or send port using the pipeline that you want to set properties for. Click **Properties**.  

  2. Click the ellipsis button (â€¦) next to the pipeline that you want to set properties for.  

  3. Enter values for the UNA delimiters as a comma-delimited list (for UNA1, UNA2, UNA3, UNA4, UNA5, and UNA6), changing the defaults as required. The defaults are as follows: 0x3A, 0x2B, 0x2C, 0x3F, 0x20, 0x27.  

  4. Click **OK**.
