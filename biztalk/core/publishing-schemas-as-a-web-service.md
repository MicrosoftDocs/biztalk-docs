# Publishing Schemas as a Web Service
You use the BizTalk Web Services Publishing Wizard to create Web services that use existing schemas. You declare the Web services, Web methods, and request and response schemas that you want to publish. Using the wizard, you define the target namespace, SOAP header requirements, and the location of the generated Web service project.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  You must compile the BizTalk assemblies containing the schemas.  
> 
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Each Web method can have one request schema and one response schema.  
> 
> [!NOTE]
>  To publish schemas as a Web service, you must have [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] installed.  
> 
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Prior to running the BizTalk Web Services Publishing Wizard, you must enable Web services. For more information about enabling Web services, see [Enabling Web Services](../core/enabling-web-services.md).
