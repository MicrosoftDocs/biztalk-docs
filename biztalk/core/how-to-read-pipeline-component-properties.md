# How to Read Pipeline Component Properties
The Properties window contains two sections for components: general properties and component properties. General properties are common to all components, though their values change between components.  
  
### To read the general properties for a pipeline component  
  
1.  Drag the pipeline component into a stage of the pipeline, or select a component if it already exists in the pipeline.  
  
2.  In the Properties window, in the **General** section, do the following.  
  
    |Use this|To do this|  
    |--------------|----------------|  
    |**Name**|Indicates the component name.|  
    |**Assembly**|Indicates the assembly and associated .NET information for the component.|  
    |**Description**|Indicates the friendly name of the pipeline component.|  
    |**Managed**|Indicates whether the pipeline component is managed. **Yes** if the component is a .NET managed component; **No** if the pipeline component is a COM component.|  
    |**Path**|Indicates the fully qualified path to the .NET component.|  
    |**Type**|Indicates the component type, the assembly, and the associated .NET information for the component.|
