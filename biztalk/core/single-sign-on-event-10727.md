## Explanation  
 This Warning indicates that SSO was unable to replay a password change recorded in the replay file.  

 Replay files are used by password sync when the ENTSSO server cannot contact the SSO database. A progress file indicates how far through SSO was able to read the replay file in-case contact with the SSO database is again lost.  

## User Action  
 To resolve this warning, do the following:  

- Check System and Application event logs for associated events.
