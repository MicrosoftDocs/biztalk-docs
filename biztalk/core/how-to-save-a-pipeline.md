# How to Save a Pipeline
Saving a pipeline stores information about the pipeline configuration to a .btp file, which specifies:  
  
-   The name of the pipeline.  
  
-   The template and policy that it is based on (send or receive).  
  
-   The sequence of components that are part of the pipeline, including the order and set of components used in each stage.  
  
-   The configuration information for each of the pipeline components.
