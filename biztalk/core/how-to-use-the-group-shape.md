# How to Use the Group Shape
![](../core/media/ebiz-orch-group.gif "ebiz_orch_group")  
Group shape  
  
## Annotations and placeholders  
 You can use the **Group** shape as a placeholder for functionality yet to be added, or you can use it to make annotations about what actions take place within it.  
  
 The name property on the **Group** shape can be up to 512 characters long. You can type annotations into the **Name** property and, when the shape is collapsed, the entire name will be displayed. When the shape is expanded, the name is truncated.
