|Message Text|The AS2 Decoder failed processing when validating the MIC value returned in the MDN.  Details of the MDN message are as follows:  AS2-From:"{0}" AS2-To:"{1}" MessageID:"{2}" OriginalMessageID:"{3}"|  
  
## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that the receive pipeline could not process the incoming MDN because the MIC (Message Integrity Check) failed validation.  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, verify that the algorithm used for generating the MDN (in the Signed-Receipt-MICalg header of the original message) is the same as the algorithm specified in the Signed-Receipt-MICalg property for the AS2 Message Receiver. Both should be either SHA1 or MD5. If the algorithm specified is the same, verify that Received-Content-MIC extension field in the second part of the multipart signed MDN message includes a valid MIC digest. If it does, determine why the MDN does not correspond to the interchange that was sent.
