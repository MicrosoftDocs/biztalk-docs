# How to Configure the BTS_BACKUP_USERS Role for Archiving and Purging Data from the BizTalk Tracking Database
The DTA Purge and Archive (BizTAlkDTADb) job normally runs using the credentials of the logged-on SQL Server Agent service account user. For added security, however, you can configure the DTA Purge and Archive (BizTalkDTADb) job to run using the credentials of an account which is a member of the BTS_BACKUP_USERS role. This helps to prevent elevation of privileges by running SQL Server Agent jobs under accounts with essential permissions.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 You must be logged on with an account that is a member of the SQL Server sysadmin fixed server role to perform this procedure.  
  
### To configure the BTS_BACKUP_USERS role for archiving and purging data from the BizTalk Tracking database  
  
1.  Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Microsoft SQL Server 2008 SP2**, and then click **SQL Server Management Studio**.  
  
2.  In the **Connect to Server** dialog box, specify the name of the SQL server where the BizTalk Tracking (BizTalkDTADb) database resides and the appropriate authentication type, and then click **Connect** to connect to the appropriate SQL Server.  
  
3.  In **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio**, double-click **BizTalkDTADb**, double-click **Security**, double-click **Roles**, and then double-click **Database Roles**.  
  
4.  In the **Object Explorer Details** pane, double-click **BTS_BACKUP_USERS**.  
  
5.  In the **Database Role Properties â€“ BTS_BACKUP_USERS** dialog box, under **Members of this role**, click **Add**.  
  
6.  In the **Select Database User or Role** dialog box, enter a user account with SQL Server Agent Service credentials, and then click **OK**.
