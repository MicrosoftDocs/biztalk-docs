# Changes in Dehydration Policy from BizTalk Server 2004
BizTalk Server dehydration policy has changed from [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2004](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2004-md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)]. The explanation for the difference between [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2004](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2004-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)] can be summarized by the following Boolean that determines dehydration in [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2004](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2004-md.md)] (true = dehydrate)  
  
```  
Dehydrate = (WaitingHistory == -1 OR WaitingHistory > TestThreshold)  
```  
  
 Dehydration policy for [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)] has changed in this minor way. [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)] always dehydrates at a receive/delay/listen if there is a wait longer than 2***MaxThreshold**.
