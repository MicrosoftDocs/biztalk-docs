# XLANG-s Data Types
XLANG/s defines standard value types that are reflections of their C# counterparts. These include **Boolean**, **Byte**, **Char**, **Decimal**, **Double**, **Int16**, **Int32**, **Int64**, **SByte**, **Single**, **String**, **UInt16**, **UInt32**, and **UInt64**. XLANG/s supports single-dimensional arrays, but does not support array literals.  
  
 XLANG/s also has rich support for message handling. Messages can be based on schemas, .NET classes, Web message types (WSDL), or complex message types. XLANG/s supports the following complex data types:  
  
-   **messagetype.** This data type defines multipart message types which are defined as combinations of data elements and XSD-based messages and Method-Message types (messages that match the signature format of a method of a class or interface).  
  
-   **porttype.** This data type defines a collection of port operations that a port instance of that type can act upon.  
  
-   **correlationsettype.** This data type defines the data that will be used in any instance of a correlation set variable. Correlation set data is the routing mechanism used to ensure that messages moving through the system are dispatched to the appropriate running instance of a business process. For example, if a purchase order is sent to a trading partner for processing, it is imperative that the correct instance of the business process corresponding to that purchase order be invoked on its return.  
  
-   **servicelinktype.** This data type defines the set of **porttype** values that form a logically consistent group of ports used in a business process. The use of service links is a powerful mechanism that allows dynamic assignment to a group of ports at run time. This allows you to define a single business process that can be used to interact with multiple trading partners.
