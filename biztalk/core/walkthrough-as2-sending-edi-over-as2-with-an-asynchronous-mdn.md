# Walkthrough (AS2): Sending EDI over AS2 with an Asynchronous MDN
This walkthrough provides a set of step-by-step procedures that creates a solution for sending EDI messages over AS2, with an asynchronous MDN.  You can create and test the full solution in this walkthrough on a single computer  
  
## Prerequisites  
 The following are prerequisites for performing the procedure in this topic:  
  
- You must be logged on as a member of the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administrators or [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] B2B Operators group.  
  
- The computer that runs the walkthrough must have Internet Information Services (IIS) 7 installed.  
  
- If the computer that runs the walkthrough is installed with a 64-bit version of Windows, you must ensure that the BizTalk hosts are marked as 32-bit only. You must also ensure IIS has the Enable 32-Bit Application Setting for the Application Pools set to True. For more information, see [Tutorial 3: AS2 Tutorial](../core/tutorial-3-as2-tutorial.md).  
  
## How the Solution Sends an EDI/AS2 Message and Returns an Asynchronous MDN  
 The solution will do the following:  
  
1. A one-way FILE receive port receives an EDI interchange from Contoso.  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   >  The events in this list may not occur in the order shown.  
  
2. Using a passthrough receive pipeline, the receive port drops the test message into the MeassageBox unchanged.  
  
3. A static one-way send port picks up the EDI interchange and encodes it into AS2 format.  
  
4. The send port sends the EDI interchange over AS2 transport to the Fabrikam party.  
  
5. The one-way receive port at Fabrikam receives the AS2 message using the Fabrikam virtual directory. The receive pipeline decodes the EDI interchange from AS2, and drops the EDI interchange into the MessageBox.  
  
6. The same one-way receive port also generates an MDN and drops the MDN into the MessageBox.  
  
7. A static one-way send port pick up the EDI message.  
  
8. The static one-way send port sends the EDI message to a local folder.  
  
9. A one-way dynamic send port picks up the asynchronous MDN.  
  
10. The one-way dynamic send port sends the MDN to Contoso.  
  
11. A one-way receive port receives the MDN, and drops it into the MessageBox.  
  
12. A static one-way send port with a passthrough send pipeline picks up the MDN.  
  
13. The one-way send port sends the MDN to a local folder.  
  
    The following figure shows the architecture for this solution.  
  
    ![AS2 sending with an asynchronous MDN](../core/media/343bbfcc-5387-426c-8700-db9738816218.gif "343bbfcc-5387-426c-8700-db9738816218")  
  
## The Functionality in this Solution  
 The following applies to the functionality of this walkthrough:  
  
-   This walkthrough deals with AS2 functionality, not EDI functionality. As a result, all ports involved in AS2 processing use either AS2Receive or AS2Send pipelines, not AS2EdiReceive or AS2EdiSend. Ports that are not involved in AS2 processing use PassThruReceive or PassThruTransmit pipelines.  
  
-   Status reporting is not enabled.  
  
-   This solution does not configure signing, compression, encryption, or message storage in the non-repudiation database. For procedures on configuring those properties, see [Configuring AS2 Properties](../core/configuring-as2-properties.md).  
  
## Configuring and Testing the Walkthrough  
 The procedures required for this solution include the following:  
  
- Build and deploy a BizTalk project with the required message schema, making the schema available for use by [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] in processing the received interchange.  
  
- Enable the BTS ISAPI filter used in receiving the AS2 message.  
  
- Create a Fabrikam virtual directory that receives the AS2 message from Contoso, as configured in the receive location.  
  
- Create a Contoso virtual directory that receives the AS2 message from Fabrikam, as configured in the receive location.  
  
- Specify that the Fabrikam and Contoso virtual directories are not managed by Windows SharePoint Services.  
  
- Create a one-way FILE receive port to receive the EDI test message that will be sent via AS2 transport. Create the local folder to receive the test message.  
  
- Create a static one-way HTTP send port for [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] to send the AS2 message containing the EDI business document to Fabrikam. Configure the send pipeline to be the AS2Send pipeline.  
  
- Create a one-way HTTP receive port for [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] to receive the AS2 message. Configure the receive pipeline to be the AS2Receive pipeline. Configure the receive location to receive the AS2 message via the Fabrikam virtual directory.  
  
- Create a static one-way FILE send port (with a passthrough send pipeline) to route the message payload to a local folder. Create the local folder.  
  
  > [!NOTE]
  >  If you do not have a send port to subscribe to the message payload, it will be suspended in the MessageBox.  
  
- Create a dynamic one-way HTTP send port to return the MDN to Contoso.  
  
  > [!NOTE]
  >  The test solution is on a single computer; as a result, the one-way send port sending the AS2 message (from Contoso) and the one-way send port sending the MDN response (from Fabrikam) are on the same computer.  
  
- Create a one-way receive port for [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] to receive the MDN response from Fabrikam.  
  
- Create a static one-way FILE send port (with a passthrough send pipeline) to route the MDN to a local folder. Create the local folder.  
  
- Create a party (trading partner) for both Fabrikam and Contoso.  
  
- Create a business profile each for both the trading parties.  
  
- Create an AS2 agreement between the business profiles for Fabrikam and Contoso. The AS2 agreement would contain properties to send an AS2 message and receive an asynchronous MDN in return.  
  
- Test the walkthrough using a test EDI interchange.  
  
  > [!NOTE]
  >  For a test message, you can use the SamplePO.txt file that is used in the EDI Interface Developer tutorial. That file is shipped in the [!INCLUDE[btsBiztalkServerPath](../includes/btsbiztalkserverpath-md.md)]\SDK\EDI Interface Developer Tutorial\ folder. This is an X12 850 message.

4.  In the **Second Partner** section, from the **Name** drop-down list, select **Fabrikam**.  
  
5.  In the **Second Partner** section, from the **Profile** drop-down list, select **Fabrikam_Profile**.  
  
     You will notice that two new tabs get added next to the **General** tab. Each tab is for configuring a one-way AS2 agreement.  
  
6.  Perform the following tasks on the **Contoso->Fabrikam** tab.  
  
    1.  On the **Identifiers** page, enter values for **AS2-From** and **AS2-To**. For **AS2-From**, enter `Contoso`. For **AS2- To**, enter `Fabrikam`.  
  
    2.  In the **Acknowledgements (MDNs)** page, do the following:  
  
        1.  Select the **Process inbound MDN into MessageBox for routing/delivery options** check box.  
  
            > [!NOTE]
            >  Checking the **Process inbound MDN into MessageBox for routing/delivery options** is required for the testing of this walkthrough, because only then will the returned MDN be dropped into the MessageBox. That enables you to create a send port to subscribe to the MDN, and to send the MDN to a local directory, so you can verify the AS2 transmission.  
  
        2.  Select the **Request MDN** check box.  
  
        3.  Make sure the **Request Signed MDN** check box is cleared.

        5.  In **Receipt-Delivery-Option (URL)**, enter **http://localhost/Contoso/BTSHttpReceive.dll**.  
  
        6.  The **Disposition-Notification-To** is by default set to the value you specified for **Receipt-Delivery-Option (URL)** property. The value of this field is not used during AS2 processing.  
  
    3.  On the **Send Ports** page, associate the two-way send port that will be sending the EDI interchange to Fabrikam. In the **Send ports** grid, under the **Name** column, click an empty cell, and from the drop-down list, select the send port **SendISAToFab**.  
  
7.  Perform the following tasks on the **Fabrikam->Contoso** tab.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  In this walkthrough, we specify the required value in the tab so that an agreement can be successfully created. To successfully create an agreement, both one-way agreement tabs must have values defined for **AS2_From** and **AS2-To**.  
  
    1.  On the **Identifiers** page, enter values for **AS2-From** and **AS2-To**. For **AS2-From**, enter `Fabrikam`. For **AS2- To**, enter `Contoso`.  
  
8.  Click **Apply**.  
  
9. Click **OK**. The newly added agreement is listed in the **Agreements** section of the **Parties and Business Profiles** pane. The newly added agreement is enabled by default.  
  
### Testing the Walkthrough  
 This section provides information on how to test the walkthrough.  
  
##### To test the solution  
  
1. In Windows Explorer, move to [!INCLUDE[btsBiztalkServerPath](../includes/btsbiztalkserverpath-md.md)]SDK\EDI Interface Developer Tutorial. Copy the **SamplePO.txt** file.  
  
2. Paste the **SamplePO.txt** file into the local folder that you created to receive the test message from Contoso.  
  
3. Move to the local folder that you created to send the EDI payload to. Confirm that the folder contains an EDI file. Open the file and the original test message, and verify that they have the same content.  
  
4. Move to the local folder that you created to send the resulting MDN to. Confirm that the folder contains a test file; open the file, and confirm that it is an MDN file.
