# Reliable Messaging with the MSMQ Adapter
You can improve the reliability of sending and receiving messages with the MSMQ adapter by using particular configuration settings and by using transactions.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If you do not use transactions, you can lose messages in clustered configurations if a computer fails.
