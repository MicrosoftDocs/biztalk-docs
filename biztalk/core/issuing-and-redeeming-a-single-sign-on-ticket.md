# Issuing and Redeeming a Single Sign-On Ticket
After you link a user and an affiliate application, you can issue tickets to help ensure security while maintaining communications. Single Sign-On ticketing works just like other ticketing technologies: before sending the message off, you append the Single Sign-On ticket to the message as a string. The server receives your message, decodes the ticket, and uses the information as appropriate.  
  
### To issue a Single Sign-On ticket  
  
1.  Create a new ticket object with a call to I`SSOTicket`.  
  
2.  Issue the ticket with a call to I`SSOTicket.IssueTicket`.  
  
### To redeem a Single Sign-On ticket  
  
1.  Create a new ticket object with a call to I`SSOTicket`.  
  
2.  Redeem the ticket with a call to I`SSOTicket.RedeemTicket`.
