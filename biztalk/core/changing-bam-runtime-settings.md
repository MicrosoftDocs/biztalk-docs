# Changing BAM Runtime Settings
In general, you configure the BAM Runtime components when you install MicrosoftÂ® [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)]. You may want to change the BAM Runtime settings, for example to scale up your system or if you have password expiration policy.
