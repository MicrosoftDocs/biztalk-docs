# How to View BAM Aggregations
BAM aggregations are defined by the business analyst in Excel using the Excel add-in.  
  
### To view your BAM aggregations  
  
1. On Computers running [!INCLUDE[btsPlatformsComApis](../includes/btsplatformscomapis-md.md)]; click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, right-click **Internet Explorer**, and then click **Run as administrator**. In the **User Account Control** dialog box, click **Continue**. In the Internet Explorer address bar, type `http://<server>/BAM/`, where *\<server>* is the name of the computer that is running the BAM portal.  
  
    -- or --  
  
    Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, point to [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerStartMenuItemui](../includes/btsbiztalkserverstartmenuitemui-md.md)], and then click **BAM Portal Web Site**.  
  
2. From the **MyViews** navigation pane, click a view to expand the view to show the task list.  
  
3. Click the **Aggregations** task to expand the list of defined aggregations.  
  
4. Click an aggregation listed to load the aggregation in the content frame of the BAM portal.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If there are no views shown, then either views have not been created, a task typically performed by a business analyst, or permissions have not been granted to the user, a task typically performed by an administrator.
