# How to Configure BizTalk Server for Sending Encrypted Messages
The following procedure lists the steps that you have to follow to configure [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] to send encrypted messages.  
  
-   To create a pipeline to send encrypted messages  
  
-   To configure the send port for sending encrypted messages  
  
## Prerequisites  
 Before configuring [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)]s for sending encrypted messages, you must perform the steps in [How to Install the Certificates for Encrypted Messages](../core/how-to-install-the-certificates-for-encrypted-messages.md).  
  
### To create a pipeline to send encrypted messages  
  
1. In Solution Explorer in the Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)], select the project in which you want to create the pipeline.  
  
   1.  On the **File** menu, click **Add New Item**.  
  
   2.  In the **Add New Item** dialog box, expand BizTalk Project Items, click **Pipeline Files**, and then click the **Send Pipeline** template.  
  
   3.  In the **Name** field, type a name for the pipeline.  
  
   4.  Click **Add**.  
  
        The new pipeline appears in Solution Explorer.  
  
2. Drag the MIME/SMIME Encoder pipeline component into the Encode stage of a receive pipeline.  
  
    ![MIME&#47;SMIME Encoder pipeline component](../core/media/bts-dev-mimesmimeencoder.gif "BTS_DEV_MIMESMIMEEncoder")  
  
   -   In the Properties window, configure the MIME/SMIME Encoder pipeline component **Enable encryption** property to `True`. For more information about the **Enable encryption** property, see [How to Configure the MIME-SMIME Encoder Pipeline Component](../core/how-to-configure-the-mime-smime-encoder-pipeline-component.md).  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   >  You can configure the send pipeline component properties using the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console after the pipeline has been deployed into a BizTalk group. For more information, see [How to Configure Per-Instance Pipeline Properties for a Send Port](../core/how-to-configure-per-instance-pipeline-properties-for-a-send-port.md).  
   > 
   > [!NOTE]
   >  The MIME/SMIME Encoder pipeline component performs both encryption and digital signing (when configured to perform both functions). Therefore, if you are configuring [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] to send encrypted and signed messages, you can use the same send pipeline. In other words, you do not have to create separate pipelines for encryption and digital signing.  
  
3. Build and deploy the send pipeline.  
  
### To configure the send port for sending encrypted messages  
  
1.  Add the BizTalk assembly that you created in previous procedure to the BizTalk Application including the send ports to send encrypted messages. For more information about how to add BizTalk assemblies, see [How to Add a BizTalk Assembly to an Application](../core/how-to-add-a-biztalk-assembly-to-an-application.md).  
  
2.  Configure the send port in the BizTalk Application with the send pipeline that you created in previous procedure, and then assign the encryption certificate that you installed in [How to Install the Certificates for Encrypted Messages](../core/how-to-install-the-certificates-for-encrypted-messages.md). For more information about how to configure send ports, see [How to Assign a Certificate to a Send Port](../core/how-to-assign-a-certificate-to-a-send-port.md).
