## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that either the receive pipeline could not process the incoming interchange or the send pipeline could not process the outgoing interchange because the value of the AS2-From header did not conform to the specifications in AS2 RFC 4130.  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, make sure that the AS2-From header in the incoming or outgoing message conforms to the specifications in section 6.2 of AS2 RFC 4130, and then have the message resent.
