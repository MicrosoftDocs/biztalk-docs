## Explanation  
 This Warning event indicates that an application ticket was issued with validation required. Tickets cannot be redeemed without being validated. Validation of the ticket is on a per affiliate application basis.  

## User Action  
 To resolve this warning, do the following:  

- If you are using Enterprise Single Sign-On, ensure that your message is flowing only through trusted hosts. This will reduce the risk of tampering with the data in the message.  

- If your scenario allows it, turn off validation for this application. Validation is an administration option which can be turned off for the system or just for this particular application.
