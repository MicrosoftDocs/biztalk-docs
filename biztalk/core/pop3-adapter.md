# POP3 Adapter
You use the Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3) adapter to retrieve data from a server that houses POP3 mailboxes into a server running Microsoft BizTalk Server by means of the POP3 protocol.  
  
 The POP3 adapter consists of only one adapter, a receive adapter. The receive adapter controls the receive locations that use the POP3 adapter.  
  
 This topic discusses the workflow of the POP3 receive adapter.  
  
 **POP3 Receive Adapter**  
  
 The POP3 receive adapter retrieves e-mail from a specified mailbox on a specified POP3 server. By default, the POP3 receive adapter applies MIME processing to the e-mail messages that it downloads and submits these messages to BizTalk Server as multipart BizTalk messages. The POP3 receive adapter can receive and process e-mail in the following formats:  
  
- Plain text  
  
- MIME encoded  
  
- MIME encrypted  
  
- MIME encoded and signed  
  
- MIME encrypted and signed  
  
  **Batching Support for the POP3 Receive Adapter**  
  
  The POP3 receive adapter does not support batching.  
  
  **Authentication with POP3 Server**  
  
  The following authentication methods are supported for use with the POP3 adapter:  
  
- **Basic.** The POP3 server uses user provided credentials for authentication.  These credentials are sent in clear text.  
  
- **Digest (APOP).** The POP3 server uses a digest string for authentication.  
  
- **Secure Password Authentication (SPA).** The POP3 server uses current process credentials for authentication.
