# BizTalk Server Message Context Properties (Receive Handlers)
In addition to the message payload, the supplementary information that composes a message must be accessible from a BizTalk Server orchestration at run time.  
  
## TIBCO RV Message Information Promoted as Message Context Properties  
 The following table lists this supplementary information:  
  
|Data Identification|Type|Routable|Receive Location|
