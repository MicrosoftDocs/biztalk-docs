# How to Enable SOAP Message Tracing
You can enable SOAP message tracing to help you debug the Web services publishing application. You set a breakpoint in a published Web service to return detailed exceptions to the Web client. To trace SOAP messages, you should use a SOAP extension. For more information about SOAP extension, see "How to: Implement a SOAP Extension" at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=62314](/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/7w06t139(v=vs.100)).
