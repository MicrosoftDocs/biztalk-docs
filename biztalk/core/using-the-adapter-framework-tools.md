# Using the Adapter Framework Tools
The BizTalk Adapter Framework uses the following tools and views to manage and develop custom adapters:  
  
- **BizTalk Server Administration console.** This is an independent application available from the **Start** menu. It is used to manage almost everything about your [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] installations. It allows you to install new adapters; manage their associated receive and send handlers; and manage ports, assemblies, and orchestrations.  
  
- **Add Adapter Metadata Wizard.** This wizard is available from within a BizTalk project in Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)]. It is available by right-clicking the project name in the Solution Explorer window in [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)], and then clicking **Add Generated Items**. The Add Adapter Metadata Wizard is available for developers that want to communicate with application adapters. Use this wizard to pull schemas corresponding to these application adapters into your project.  
  
- **Adapter property pages.** These are available through the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console. Use these pages to configure receive handlers, receive locations, send handlers, and send ports for your adapter.
