# Error - Duplicate Property Field Promotion
**Error Code**  
  
 BEC2016  
  
 **Explanation**  
  
 Multiple nodes in this schema are being promoted as Property Fields to the same **Field Element** node in the same property schema.  
  
 **User Action**  
  
 Use the **Property Fields** tab of the **Promote Properties** dialog box, accessed through the **Promote Properties** property of the **Schema** node, to delete all but one of the Property Field promotions that are associated with the same **Field Element** node in the property schema. You may want to add new **Field Element** nodes to the property schema so that the deleted promotions can be re-promoted to their own **Field Element** nodes.
