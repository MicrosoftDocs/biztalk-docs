# How BizTalk Server Implements Host Throttling
The [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] host throttling mechanism continually monitors for a throttling condition, calculates the severity of the throttling condition, and applies host throttling progressively depending on the calculated severity. The throttling mechanism is self tuning and the default configuration options are suitable for the majority of [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] processing scenarios. [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] host throttling exposes several configurable options that can be used to tune throttling for specific scenarios. For information about changing these configuration options, see [How to Modify Host Settings](../core/how-to-modify-host-settings.md).  

## Components of the host throttling algorithm  
 [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] uses the following algorithm when applying host throttling:  

1.  Continuously monitor the following parameters to see if they exceed certain thresholds. If the values for the parameter exceed the threshold for the parameter then a throttling condition exists.  

    -   Amount of memory in use (both systemwide and host process memory).  

    -   Number of in-process messages being delivered or processed (threshold for outbound throttling).  

    -   Number of threads in use.  

    -   Database size, measured by the number of items in the queue tables for all hosts and the number of items in the spool and tracking tables.  

    -   Number of concurrent database connections.  

    -   Rate of message publishing (inbound) and delivery or processing (outbound).  

2.  Determine the severity of the throttling condition. Throttling conditions are ranked in severity as follows (from most severe to least severe).  

    -   Host process memory in use exceeds threshold.  

    -   Number of in-process messages exceeds threshold.  

    -   Count of threads in use exceeds threshold.  

    -   Database size exceeds threshold.  

    -   All other throttling conditions.  

3.  Progressively apply throttling based upon the severity of the throttling condition(s). Throttling is applied more aggressively as the severity level increases. Progressive throttling is achieved as follows:  

    -   One or more throttling conditions are detected and assigned a severity.  

    -   An instruction to implement throttling is issued based on the condition with the highest severity. Depending on the throttling condition, if the condition persists, the size of various thread pools may be reduced and memory may be freed by dehydrating running orchestrations.  

    -   A delay is applied in the publishing or processing of the message, depending on whether the message is inbound or outbound. The delay period is proportional to the severity of the throttling condition, so higher severity throttling conditions will initiate a longer throttling period than lower severity throttling conditions. This delay period is adjusted up and down within certain ranges by the throttling mechanism as conditions change. The current delay period is exposed through the **Message delivery delay (ms)** and the **Message publishing delay (ms)** performance counters associated with the **BizTalk:Message Agent** performance object category. These performance object counters are documented in the topic [Host Throttling Performance Counters](../core/host-throttling-performance-counters.md).  

    -   The throttling mechanism continues to check if a throttling condition is present. If the throttling conditions are mitigated then the throttled messages are unblocked and the thread pool and other resources are allowed to operate in an unrestricted mode. If the system continues to operate without any throttling conditions, the delay period is greatly reduced. If the throttling condition persists, the delay amount is incremented proportional to the severity of the condition and subsequent messages are subject to the higher delay.  

    -   Throttling is no longer implemented when the delay period has elapsed.  

## Type of throttling conditions  
 There are three primary types of throttling conditions: rate based, resource based, and orchestration.  

1. **Rate based throttling** is divided into two categories; inbound (published) and outbound (delivered):  

   - For inbound (published) messages, BizTalk Server throttles publishing of messages if The **Message publishing incoming rate** for the host instance exceeds the **Message publishing outgoing rate\\*** the specified **Rate overdrive factor (percent)** value. The **Rate overdrive factor (percent)** parameter is configurable on the **Message Publishing Throttling Settings** dialog box. Rate based throttling for inbound messages is accomplished primarily by inducing a delay before publishing the batch of messages into the MessageBox database. No other action is taken to accomplish rate based throttling for inbound messages.  

   - For outbound (delivered) messages, BizTalk Server throttles delivery of messages if The **Message delivery incoming rate** for the host instance exceeds the **Message delivery outgoing rate** \* the specified **Rate overdrive factor (percent)** value. The **Rate overdrive factor (percent)** parameter is configurable on the **Message Processing Throttling Settings** dialog box. Rate based throttling for outbound messages is accomplished primarily by inducing a delay before removing the messages from the in-memory queue and delivering the messages to the End Point Manager (EPM) or orchestration engine for processing. No other action is taken to accomplish rate based throttling for outbound messages.  

      For more information about the rate overdrive factor and other rate-based throttling values, see [How to Modify Rate Based Throttling Settings](../core/how-to-modify-rate-based-throttling-settings.md).  

2. **Resource based throttling** monitors system resources such as threads, memory, and database size and can be applied to any service class. For more information about resource-based throttling values, see [How to Modify Resource Based Throttling Settings](../core/how-to-modify-resource-based-throttling-settings.md).  

3. **Orchestration throttling** can prevent dehydration and when to pause/resume subscriptions. For more information about orchestration throttling values, see [How to Modify Orchestration Throttling Settings](../core/how-to-modify-orchestration-throttling-settings.md).  

## Throttling condition triggers, actions, and mitigation strategies  
 This section describes the triggers for various throttling conditions, the resultant actions by the throttling mechanism, and techniques that may be employed to mitigate the throttling condition.  

### Inbound Throttling  
 The BizTalk throttling mechanism applies inbound throttling to the orchestration engine (XLANG) and to inbound adapters.  

 Use the **Message publishing throttling state** and **Message publishing throttling state duration** counters associated with **BizTalk:MessageAgent** performance object category to measure the current throttling state and duration of throttling. For more information about the available host throttling performance counters, see [Host Throttling Performance Counters](../core/host-throttling-performance-counters.md).  

 Inbound throttling can cause inbound messages to backlog at the source. If inbound throttling is applied to a receive adapter then the receive adapter may stop receiving messages until the throttling condition is mitigated.

### Outbound Throttling  
 The BizTalk throttling mechanism applies outbound throttling to the orchestration engine (XLANG) and to outbound adapters.  

 Use the **Message delivery throttling state** and **Message delivery throttling state duration** counters associated with **BizTalk:MessageAgent** performance object category to measure the current throttling state and duration of throttling. For more information about the available host throttling performance counters see [Host Throttling Performance Counters](../core/host-throttling-performance-counters.md).  

 Outbound throttling can cause delayed message delivery and messages may build up in the in-memory queue and cause de-queue threads to be blocked until the throttling condition is mitigated. When de-queue threads are blocked no additional messages are pulled from the MessageBox into the in-memory queue for outbound delivery.
