# Configuring a Port to Receive EDI Messages and Acknowledgments
To receive an EDI interchange, you can create either a one-way receive port or a request-response (two-way) receive port to receive the interchange.  

-   Create a one-way receive port if you will also create a one-way send port to send EDI acknowledgments (if enabled). You will also have to clear the **Route ACK to send pipeline on request-response receive port** agreement property.  

-   Create a request response receive port and location to return EDI acknowledgments (if enabled) over the associated send pipeline. You will also have to select the **Route ACK to send pipeline on request-response receive port** agreement property.  

## Creating a One-Way Receive Port  
 Create the receive port and location with the following configuration:  


|                   Location                    |                                              Property                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Setting                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## Creating a Request-Response Receive Port  
 Create the receive port and location with the following configuration:  

|Location|Property|Setting|  
|--------------|--------------|-------------|  
|**Receive Port Properties: General**|Port type|Request Response|  
|**Receive Port Properties: General**|Authentication|Set to **Drop messages if authentication fails** or **Keep messages if authentication fails** to authenticate the party that sent the received message.<br /><br /> Set to **No authentication** to disable authentication of the party that sent the received message.<br /><br /> **Note:** If set to **Drop messages if authentication fails** or **Keep messages if authentication fails**, the message must resolve to an agreement.|  
|**Receive Location Properties: General**|Transport Type|Can be any of a number of transport types, except FILE, which is not available in the drop-down list.<br /><br /> **Note:** A security issue could occur if you create a receive location that uses the EDIReceive pipeline and has a transport type of HTTP. The EdiReceive pipeline will not generate an HTTP "200 OK" acknowledgment. If no EDI acknowledgment is returned, the connection will remain open until the time-out period has expired.|  
|**Receive Location Properties: General**|Receive handler|BizTalkServerApplication|  
|**Receive Location Properties: General**|Receive pipeline|EdiReceive|  
|**Receive Location Properties: General**|Send pipeline|EdiSend|  
|**FILE Transport Properties: Authentication**|Use these credentials when host does not have access to network share (with User name and Password)|Set if authentication is required.|  
|**FILE Transport Properties: Batching**|Number of messages in a batch|Set if interchange is batched.|  
|**FILE Transport Properties: Batching**|Maximum batch size (in bytes)|Set if interchange is batched.|  

## Setting Agreement Properties  
 After creating the receive port and location, you need to set the agreement properties required for the receive pipeline to function. These properties are set in various pages of the **Agreement Properties** dialog box. For a list of the properties that the EDI Disassembler must have to process an EDI interchange in the EdiReceive receive pipeline, see [How the EDI Disassembler Works](../core/how-the-edi-disassembler-works.md).
