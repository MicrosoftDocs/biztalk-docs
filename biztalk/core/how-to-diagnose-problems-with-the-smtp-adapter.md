# How to Diagnose Problems with the SMTP Adapter
This section contains steps that can be followed to help diagnose problems with the SMTP adapter.  
  
### Check the SMTP log files of the SMTP Server for errors  
  
-   The target SMTP server log files can contain information that is helpful for troubleshooting problems with the SMTP adapter. By default the SMTP log files on [!INCLUDE[btsWinSvrNoVersion](../includes/btswinsvrnoversion-md.md)] are located in the following directory:  
  
     *%WinDir%\\*system32\LogFiles\SMTPSVC1\  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  *%WinDir%* is a placeholder for the location of the Windows directory on the SMTP server.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  SMTP logging is disabled by default on [!INCLUDE[btsWinSvr2k8](../includes/btswinsvr2k8-md.md)]. For information about enabling logging for SMTP, see the Windows Server documentation.
