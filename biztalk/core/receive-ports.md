# Receive Ports
A receive port can function as a one-way port or as a two-way port. A one-way receive port only receives messages. A request-response (or two-way) port can both receive and send messages. A receive port is a logical grouping of receive locations. For example, you create multiple receive locations, and you want the messages received at these locations to be processed by a specific orchestration.
