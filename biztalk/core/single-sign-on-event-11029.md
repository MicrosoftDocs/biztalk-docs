|  Message Text   | The SSO database is case sensitive. The SSO server will run in case sensitive mode. See documentation for details.%r |
  
## Explanation  
 By default the SSO server is not case-sensitive. However, the SQL Server SSO database has been configured to be case-sensitive, so the SSO Server will also run in case sensitive mode.  
  
## User Action  
 Be aware of this when specifying application names and external account names as they are now case-sensitive. For more information, see [SSO Server](../core/sso-server.md).
