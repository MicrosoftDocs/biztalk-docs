# Single Sign-On: Event 11029
## Details  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Product Name|Enterprise Single Sign-On|  
|Product Version|[!INCLUDE[btsSSOVersion](../includes/btsssoversion-md.md)]|  
|Event ID|11029|  
|Event Source|ENTSSO|  
|Component|N/A|  
|Symbolic Name|SSO_INFO_CASE_SENSITIVE|  
|Message Text|The SSO database is case sensitive. The SSO server will run in case sensitive mode. See documentation for details.%r|  
  
## Explanation  
 By default the SSO server is not case-sensitive. However, the SQL Server SSO database has been configured to be case-sensitive, so the SSO Server will also run in case sensitive mode.  
  
## User Action  
 Be aware of this when specifying application names and external account names as they are now case-sensitive. For more information, see [SSO Server](../core/sso-server.md).
