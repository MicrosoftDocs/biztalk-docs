## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that the receive pipeline could not process the incoming X12 interchange because the group control number in the GS06 and GE02 fields of the interchange did not conform to the data type or length specified in the service schema. The service schema is the X12ServiceSchema in BaseArtifacts.dll.  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, make sure that the group control numbers contained in the GS06 and GE02 fields of the interchange conform to the data type (X12_N0) and length (between one and nine digits) specified in the service schema, and then have the interchange resent.
