# Creating Tracking Profiles
You create a new tracking profile or modify an existing one to better manage and monitor a specific business process for your organization. The Tracking Profile Editor (TPE) allows you to define the data to collect to meet the business analyst's requirement. The profile you create or modify can be as simple or as complex as you like depending on your business requirements.  
  
 As a developer, you create a new profile based on a BAM activity definition. A deployed activity definition may already have a profile defined for it. If not, you create a tracking profile by performing these tasks:  
  
-   Selecting a deployment server and database  
  
-   Selecting a deployed BAM activity definition from the BizTalk Management database  
  
-   Defining the data to be extracted from the orchestration  
  
-   Connecting activities, if the actual implementation of your business process spans more than one orchestration
