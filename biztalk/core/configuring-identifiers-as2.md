# Configuring Identifiers (AS2)
In the partner agreement, you must specify the sender and receiver parties. These values are also used for agreement resolution for the inbound or outbound messages.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The following properties are disabled on this page if you cleared the **Local BizTalk processes messages received by the party or supports sending messages from this party** check box while creating the party for which you are creating the agreement.  
> 
> - **AS2To** under **Additional Agreement Resolvers** section.  
> 
>   The properties are disabled only on the one-way agreement tab that corresponds to the properties for interchanges being sent from the party. For example, if you create two parties Party A and Party B and for Party A, you cleared the check box, the above list of properties are disabled on the **Party A->Party B** one-way agreement tab.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 You must be logged on as a member of the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administrators or [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] B2B Operators group.  
  
### To configure the identifier properties  
  
1. Create an AS2 agreement as described in [Configuring General Settings (AS2)](../core/configuring-general-settings-as2.md). To update an existing AS2 agreement, right-click the agreement in the **Parties and Business Profiles** page, and click **Properties**.  
  
2. On a one-way agreement tab, click **Identifiers**.  
  
3. In the **AS2-From** page, specify the name of the trading partner sending the AS2 message.  
  
4. In the **AS2-To** page, specify the name of the trading partner receiving the AS2 message.  
  
5. Under the **Additional Agreement Resolvers** section, for the **AS2To** property, enter an additional alias for the partner that receives the message.  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   >  This property is optional. This property is available for backward compatibility. When a party definition is migrated from BizTalk Server 2006 R2 or BizTalk Server 2009 to BizTalk Server, the name of the party in the previous versions of [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] is included as a value for this property. This ensures that the agreement resolution happens and the existing applications and partner definitions can be used with BizTalk Server.  
  
6. Click **Apply** to accept the changes before continuing with the configuration, or click **OK** to validate the changes and then close the dialog box.
