# Accessing Nested Members of a Class
The rule engine allows you to use a nested property or method of an object in a rule. For example, suppose you have a class named AClass, which has a property named B of type BClass, which has a field named C. The rule engine allows you to build rules accessing the field C by using the A.B.C syntax. However, it is possible to use this syntax only when building the rules programmatically, not when using the Business Rule Composer tool. The following sample code demonstrates how to use a property of an object, which is a property of another object:  
  
```  
// Create the condition list IF 1 == 1  
Equal eq = new Equal(new Constant(1), new Constant(1));  
  
// Create the action collection  
ActionCollection ac = new ActionCollection();  
  
// Create class binding and class member binding to cField  
// Set the value of cField to "Changed"  
Constant chg = new Constant("Changed");  
ArgumentCollection argCol = new ArgumentCollection();  
argCol.Add(chg);  
ClassBinding lstClass = new ClassBinding(typeof(AClass));  
ClassMemberBinding bBinding = new ClassMemberBinding("bObj", lstClass);  
ClassMemberBinding CBinding = new ClassMemberBinding("cField", bBinding,argCol);  
UserFunction uf_C = new UserFunction(CBinding);  
ac.Add(uf_C);  
  
// Create the rule  
Rule rl = new Rule("ChangeCField", eq, ac);  
  
// Create the policy  
RuleSet rs = new RuleSet("NestedNodeTest");  
rs.Rules.Add(rl);  
  
//Create the facts  
AClass aObj = new AClass();  
Console.WriteLine("The value of aObj.bObj.cField BEFORE executing the policy");  
Console.WriteLine(aObj.bObj.cField);  
  
//Execute the policy  
PolicyTester tester = new PolicyTester(rs);  
tester.Execute(aObj);  
  
Console.WriteLine("The value of aObj.bObj.cField AFTER executing the policy");  
Console.WriteLine(aObj.bObj.cField);  
```
