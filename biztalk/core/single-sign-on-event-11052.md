|  Message Text   | The SSO Affiliate Administrators account contains one or more individual (not group) accounts. If these individual accounts are deleted from Active Directory or the local computer they must be promptly removed from the SSO system or they could become a security risk.%r<br /><br /> SSO Affiliate Administrators: %1%r<br /><br /> Individual accounts: %2 |
  
## Explanation  
 Deleting an individual account from the Active Directory or local computer does not automatically delete that account from the SSO System. This means that if the account USER1 was deleted locally, and then a different user (for instance, a new employee) joined the system using that same name, the SSO System would grant the new USER1 all security rights possessed by the original USER1. This poses a security risk.  
  
 As a best practice, it is recommended that SSO Administration accounts use Active Directory group (not individual) accounts.  
  
## User Action  
 No action is necessary until an individual account is deleted from Active Directory or the local computer. At that point, you must delete the individual account from the SSO System as soon as possible.
