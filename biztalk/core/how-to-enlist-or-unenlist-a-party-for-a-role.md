# How to Enlist or Unenlist a Party for a Role
This topic describes how to use the BizTalk Server Administration console to enlist or unenlist a party for a role. Enlisting a party for a role assigns the party to the role and unenlisting the party removes the party from the role.  
  
 When enlisting or unenlisting a party for a role, bear in mind the following points:  
  
-   You must create a party before you can enlist it. For instructions, see [Create a Party](managing-parties.md).  
  
-   You can enlist or unenlist a party for a role without needing to restart the application.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The application developer can enlist or unenlist a party during the development process by using the procedure in this topic.
