# Handling Encoding in a Disassembler Pipeline Component
Ensure that your custom disassembler component encodes outbound documents in one of the following formats:  
  
- UTF-8  
  
- UTF-16  
  
- UTF-32  
  
- UTF-16LE  
  
- UTF-16BE  
  
  The orchestration engine may not be able to process documents with other encoding formats.  
  
  UTF-32LE and UTF-32BE are not supported by the .NET Framework; to use these formats, you must create a custom encoding implementation.
