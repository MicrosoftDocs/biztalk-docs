# Interceptor Configuration File
The BAM interceptors for Windows Workflow Foundation and Windows Communication Foundation rely on an interceptor configuration file to determine what events and date elements to intercept. The configuration file is XML and is defined by the interceptor configuration schema and either the Windows Workflow Foundation schema or the Windows Communication Framework schema depending upon which technology you are targeting.  
  
 This section focuses on the base interceptor configuration including elements and attributes. Additional functionality is provided by the technology-specific interceptors and are explained in separate sections.
