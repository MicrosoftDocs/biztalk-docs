# ListApp Command
Prints to the console a list of all of the resource artifacts in a BizTalk application, along with the locally unique identifier (LUID) and type of each artifact. A resource artifact is one that you can add to a BizTalk application by using the [AddResource command](../core/addresource-command.md), such as an assembly, a script, a file, a policy, a COM component, a virtual directory, a BAM artifact, or a certificate. These resource artifacts also display in the Resources node of the BizTalk Server Administration console.  
  
 If you specify the ResourceSpec parameter for this command, the same information is written to an .xml file. You can use this .xml file with the **ExportApp** command to export a subset of artifacts in an application to an .msi file, as described in [ExportApp Command](../core/exportapp-command.md).  
  
 For virtual directories, this command substitutes the Web server host name with "localhost." If you use the file generated by the ResourceSpec parameter with the ExportApp command, you manually edit the file to replace "localhost" with the host name and port number if the Web server exists on a remote computer. If you do not, the virtual directory and its contents will not be added to the application .msi file.  
  
 Example: http://MyWebServer:80/MyVirtualDirectory.  
  
## Usage  
 **BTSTask ListApp** [**/ApplicationName:**<em>value</em>] [**/ResourceSpec:**<em>value</em>] [**/Server:**<em>value</em>] [**/Database:**<em>value</em>]  
  
## Parameters  
  
|Parameter|Required|Value|  
|---------------|--------------|-----------|  
|**/ApplicationName** (or **/A**, see Remarks)|No|Name of the BizTalk application for which to list artifacts. If the name includes spaces, you must enclose it with double quotation marks (").  If this parameter is not specified, the default application is used.|  
|**/ResourceSpec** (or **/R**, see Remarks)|No|Full path of the .xml file to generate with this command. This file will list the artifacts in the application, along with the LUID and type of each one. Example: C:\Artifacts\MyArtifacts.xml. If the path includes spaces, it must be enclosed with double quotation marks ("). If a file having the same path and file name already exists, it is overwritten.|  
|**/Server** (or **/S**, see Remarks)|No|Name of the SQL Server instance hosting the BizTalk Management database, in the form ServerName\InstanceName,Port.<br /><br /> Instance name is only required when the instance name is different than the server name. Port is only required when SQL Server uses a port number other than the default (1433).<br /><br /> Examples:<br /><br /> Server=MyServer<br /><br /> Server=MyServer\MySQLServer,1533<br /><br /> If not provided, the name of the SQL Server instance running on the local computer is used.|  
|**/Database** (or **/D**, see Remarks)|No|Name of the BizTalk Management database. If not specified, the BizTalk Management database running in the local instance of SQL Server is used.|  
  
## Sample  
 **BTSTask ListApp /ApplicationName:MyApplication /ResourceSpec:C:\Artifacts\MyArtifacts.xml**  
  
## Remarks  
 Parameters are not case-sensitive. You do not need to type the entire parameter name to specify it; you can type the first few letters of the parameter name that identify it unambiguously.
