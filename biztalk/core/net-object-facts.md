# .NET Object Facts
In the Business Rule Composer, you can specify a .NET assembly as a data source. You can subsequently select a class or class member from the assembly, and drag it onto a vocabulary definition or rule.  
  
 Asserted .NET object processing is the most straightforward of the processing types. The engine processes each object as a unique instance. For more information about the**Assert** function, see [Engine Control Functions](../core/engine-control-functions.md).
