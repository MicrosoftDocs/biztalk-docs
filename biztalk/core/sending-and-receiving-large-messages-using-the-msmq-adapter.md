# Sending and Receiving Large Messages Using the MSMQ Adapter
The MSMQ adapter default message handling depends, in part, on the size of the message. When a message is less than four megabytes (4 MB), the MSMQ adapter uses the .NET Framework Class Library. Otherwise, it uses the large message extensions in Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)].  
  
 If your application consistently receives or sends large messages, you may have to control the amount of memory that the adapter uses. For more information about conserving memory, see [Optimizing Performance of the MSMQ Adapter](../core/optimizing-performance-of-the-msmq-adapter.md).
