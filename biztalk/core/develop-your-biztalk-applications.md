# Develop your BizTalk applications
This section contains information for developers who are tasked with creating BizTalk applications. Once these applications are created, they are usually managed by an administrator, using information found in the Operations and Administrative Tasks.  
  
 The topic Developing BizTalk Server Applications discusses the activities associated with developing a BizTalk Server application, which consists of such things as schema definitions, message mappings, receive and send pipelines, message subscriptions, and orchestrations.  
  
 The topic Creating Custom Components discusses the development of components which are used to modify or extend certain elements of BizTalk Server infrastructure, such as send or receive adapter components, send or receive pipeline components, and functoid components. These elements of infrastructure are used by BizTalk Server applications, but are not themselves parts of a BizTalk Server application.
