## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that the EDI receive pipeline could not process an incoming interchange because it had the same interchange, group, or transaction set control number as a previously received interchange. This will result in a failure as long as the appropriate duplicate control number checks are enabled.  

## User Action  
 To resolve this error, do one of the following:  

- Ensure that the interchange sent to BizTalk Server does not have the same group control number as a previous interchange, if the corresponding duplicate control number check is enabled.  

- Disable the duplicate group control number check. In the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration Console, right-click the appropriate party, and open either the EDIFACT Interchange Processing Properties or the X12 Interchange Processing Properties dialog box for the party as an interchange sender. To disable a check for an EDIFACT interchange, clear the Check for duplicate UNG5 (Group control number) in interchange property. To disable a check for an X12 interchange, clear the Check for duplicate GS6 (Group control number) in interchange property.
