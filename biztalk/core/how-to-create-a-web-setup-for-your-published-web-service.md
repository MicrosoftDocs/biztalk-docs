# How to Create a Web Setup for Your Published Web Service
You can create an installation package to facilitate setting up your Web service in a production environment. This produces an .MSI file.  
  
### To create an installation package to produce an .MSI file using Visual Studio  
  
1.  Open your published ASP.NET Web service project.  
  
2.  In Solution Explorer, right-click the solution node, click **Add**, and then click **New Project**.  
  
3.  In the **Add New Project** dialog box, in the **Project Types** area, expand **Other Project Types**, expand **Setup and Deployment Projects**, and then select **Visual Studio Installer**. In the **Templates** area, select **Web Setup Project**.  
  
4.  In the **Name** text box, type a name for the Web Setup Project. You can use the same name as the ASP.NET Web Service project and add "_Setup" as a suffix and then click **OK**.  
  
5.  In Solution Explorer, right-click the newly created Web setup project node, and point to **View**, and then click **File System**.  
  
6.  In the **File System** window, right-click the **Web Application Folder** node and point to **Add**, then click **Project Output**.  
  
7.  In the **Add Project Output Group** dialog box, select **Primary Output** and **Content Files** from the ASP.NET Web Service project and then click **OK**.  
  
8.  In Solution Explorer, expand the **Detected Dependencies** node under the Web setup project.  
  
9. Select all dependencies. In the **Properties** window, set the **Exclude** property to **True**.  
  
10. Build your Web setup project.
