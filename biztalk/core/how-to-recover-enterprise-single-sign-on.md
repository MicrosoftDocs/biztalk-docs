# How to Recover Enterprise Single Sign-On
Before you can recover BizTalk Server, you must first recover Enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO).  
  
## Prerequisites  
  
-   You must be logged on as a member of the Single Sign-On Administrators group and a member of the Administrators group to perform this task.  
  
-   You must have the password used during SSO configuration.  
  
-   All databases are intact on the remote server.  
  
-   The backup master secret file is intact and stored in a safe place.  
  
### To recover Enterprise Single Sign-On  
  
1.  Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerStartMenuItemui](../includes/btsbiztalkserverstartmenuitemui-md.md)], and then click **BizTalk Server Configuration**.  
  
2.  In Microsoft BizTalk Server Configuration, in the console tree, click **Enterprise SSO**.  
  
3.  In the details pane, select **Enable Enterprise Single Sign-On on this computer**, and then click **Join an existing SSO system**.  
  
4.  In **Data stores**, enter the name of the SQL server hosting the SSO database and the name of the SSO database.  
  
5.  In **Windows service**, enter the user name and password for the SSO service account that you used when you originally installed and configured BizTalk Server.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  You can use a different account, but it must be a member of the Single Sign-On Administrators group.  
  
6.  Click **Apply Configuration**.  
  
     A warning that no master secrets were retrieved is displayed. You can use Event Viewer to verify that the Enterprise Single Sign-On service is now started and running on the computer.  
  
7.  Click **File**, and then click **Exit**.  
  
8.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **cmd**, and then click **OK**.  
  
9. At the command prompt, type:  
  
     **cd Program Files\Common Files\Enterprise Single Sign-On**  
  
10. At the command prompt, type:  
  
     **ssoconfig -restoreSecret**  *\<backupfile\>*  
  
     where *\<backupfile\>* is the name of the master secret file that you backed up.  
  
     When **ssoconfig** prompts you for the backup file password, enter the password that was specified during SSO configuration. If the password is correct, **ssoconfig** displays the following message:  
  
     **The operation completed successfully**
