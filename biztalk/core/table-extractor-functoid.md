# Table Extractor Functoid
The **Table Extractor** functoid determines which data to extract from each row of the looping grid as the **Table Looping** functoid presents the rows. You need one **Table Extractor** functoid for each output field. For example, suppose your input instance message had an address in a single format, but your output instance message needed the address in two formats with each format tagged. Then you would need a **Table Extractor** functoid for the tag and for each element of the address. For more information about configuring the **Table Extractor** functoid, see [Table-Driven Looping Configuration](../core/table-driven-looping-configuration.md). Also see [Table-Driven Looping Example](../core/table-driven-looping-example.md).
