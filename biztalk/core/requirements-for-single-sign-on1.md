# Single Sign-On requirements for BizTalk Server

To use Single Sign-On (SSO), you must have the following software installed:  
  
- Microsoft BizTalk Server
  
- Visual Studio  
  
- Enterprise Single Sign-On  
  
- A Server System that supports SSO  
  
- The isolated host should be configured as **Authentication Trusted**.  
  
## Enable SSO  
  
1. In the **Transport Properties** window, select **Yes** for **Use SSO**.  
  
2. Select an appropriate affiliate application when specifying transport properties.  
  
   For information about creating an affiliate application, see [Creating Affiliate Applications](../core/creating-affiliate-applications4.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
> After performing work using SSO, remember to reset any Web-Sharing folder to **Do not share**. Applications using that folder will not update or uninstall correctly if the folder is shared because it is considered to be in use.
