# Request Assistance
When you require assistance from your systems administrator or other support person with your [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] implementation, you can use the **Assistance** button at the bottom of the **Results** detail page to place an assistance request.  
  
## How to request assistance  
 Clicking the **Assistance** button opens a **Request Technical Assistance Web** page dialog box. To request assistance, you enter a subject describing your problem in the **Subject** text box. In the **Problem Description** text box you describe the problem you are encountering with the details your systems administrator will need to address the problem. When you are satisfied with the problem description, click the **Send Report** button to send the assistance request. Your request is placed in the server application event log and your systems administrator can retrieve it using message and service instance tracking from the Group Overview page..
