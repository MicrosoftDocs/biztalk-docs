# Using Visual Studio
Within the BizTalk project system, you can use many of the tools available in Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)], as well as tools designed specifically for creating applications that run on Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)]. This topic describes some of the common procedures that you can use to create an application that runs on [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)].  

 When you use the BizTalk project system, you use many of the same user interface (UI) components, such as Solution Explorer and the Properties window, to create your application. Additionally, there are components, such as BizTalk Editor, that are available only after you install [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)]. While you can use these specific [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] UI components with any project system, they specifically enable you to build applications that run on [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)].  

 While the BizTalk project system uses many of the same menus and menu commands as other [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] project systems, some commands are new, unavailable, expanded, or restricted when you use the BizTalk project system. This topic describes the various menus available in [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] and how they interact with the BizTalk project system.  

> [!NOTE]
>  The following topics are focused on showing the menus and menu items that behave differently from [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)].  

## File Menu  
 Most of the **File** menu commands work the same way for BizTalk projects as for other [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] projects. Certain commands are unsupported or unavailable when working with the BizTalk projects. For example, the **Print** command is not supported when you are working with pipelines.  

## View Menu  
 The following table lists BizTalk project system windows, toolbars, and toolboxes available from the **View** menu.  


|   Submenu name    |  Submenu name (if applicable)   |                                                                                                                                                                               Description                                                                                                                                                                               |

|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|         **Add Reference**         |                                                                                                                      Use this menu item to reference other projects, other .NET projects, or COM projects.                                                                                                                      |
|     **Add Service Reference**     |                                                                              Use this menu item to add WCF service references. You also use this item to add Web references by clicking **Advanced** on the **Add Service Reference** dialog box.                                                                               |
|      **Add Generated Items**      |                                                                                                                    Use this menu item to add a generated adapter or schema file or to consume a WCF service.                                                                                                                    |
| **Add Adapter Service Reference** | Use this menu item to browse (and search) metadata and generate .NET CLR proxy classes using the selected operations and/or types. **Note:**  This item appears in BizTalk menu only if at least one adapter (shipped with [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)]) is installed on your computer. |
| **Add Consume Adapter Reference** |       Use this menu item to browse (and search) metadata from adapter and then generate XML Schemas for selected operations. **Note:**  This item appears in BizTalk menu only if at least one adapter (shipped with [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)]) is installed on your computer.       |

 For information about adding Web references for BizTalk Web services, see [Adding Web References](../core/adding-web-references.md).  

## Build Menu  
 The **Build** menu contains the build commands. It also contains the command to run **Configuration Manager** to set build and deployment configuration options. To deploy a project, right click the project in Solution Explorer then click the **Deploy** command. You should use this method of deployment only when you are developing your application or if you have a simple scenario. This method of deployment does **not** keep track of versions, and you can easily overwrite previous versions of an assembly. Reusing the same version is useful in a development or testing phase, but not in the production environment. For information about deployment, see [Understanding BizTalk Application Deployment and Management](../core/understanding-biztalk-application-deployment-and-management.md).  

 To add your BizTalk artifacts to the BizTalk Management database, run the Assembly Deployment Wizard. For more information about the Assembly Deployment Wizard, see [How to Deploy a BizTalk Assembly from Visual Studio](../core/how-to-deploy-a-biztalk-assembly-from-visual-studio.md).  

> [!NOTE]
>  [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] contains a version of Dotfuscator that will take a compiled assembly and obfuscate it, renaming symbols and other identifiers in an effort to protect intellectual property. Assemblies run through this tool cannot be deployed.  

## Debug Menu  
 The BizTalk project system supports the **Debug** menu commands. For information about debugging in [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], see [Debugging Orchestrations](../core/debugging-orchestrations.md).  

## BizTalk Menu  
 When you work with a project, the **BizTalk** menu appears when you open the BizTalk Editor or the BizTalk Mapper or the BizTalk Orchestration Designer. In other words, the BizTalk menu appears when you try to edit a schema or a map or an orchestration.  

> [!NOTE]
>  You might be able to access Orchestration Designer, BizTalk Editor, and BizTalk Mapper from other project systems in [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)]; however, the behavior of these BizTalk tools might be unpredictable. You should use Orchestration Designer, BizTalk Editor, and BizTalk Mapper within the context of a BizTalk project.  

## Help Menu  
 The following table lists some of the commands on the **Help** menu as they pertain to [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Help.  


|            Menu command            |                                                                                                                                                                             Description                                                                                                                                                                             |
