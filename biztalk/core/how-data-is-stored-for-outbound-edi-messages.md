# How Data Is Stored for Outbound EDI Messages
[!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] does the following to generate a status report entry for an outbound interchange:  
  
1.  When outbound message XML is sent to the EDI send pipeline, the send pipeline creates an entry in the status reporting data store with the following values:  
  
    -   Interchange status entry is set to Processed  
  
    -   Interchange ACK status entry (one per interchange) is set to Expected  
  
    -   Functional ACK status entries (one per group in X12, one for all groups in EDIFACT) are set to Expected  
  
2.  After the EDI message has been sent to the trading partner, and the acknowledgment has been returned from the trading partner, the EDI receive pipeline that receives the acknowledgment updates the Interchange status, the Interchange ACK status, and the Functional ACK status entries to Accepted/Partially Accepted/Rejected, as appropriate.  
  
## Data Stored by the Send Pipeline for Outbound Interchanges  
 The send pipeline creates a record in the status report data store for each interchange that it sends. Most data required for the entry is available from the interchange header/trailer segments (ISA/IEA or UNB/UNZ). Other data is available from send port properties. The data stored includes:  
  
-   Record Type = Interchange Status  
  
-   Interchange Direction = Update Data = Send  
  
-   Interchange Receiver = Update Data  
  
-   Interchange Sender = Update Data  
  
-   Interchange Date = Update Data  
  
-   Interchange Time = Update Data  
  
-   Interchange Control ID = Update Data  
  
-   Interchange Status: Processed/Sent. A status of Processed indicates that the send pipeline has successfully processed the interchange and handed it over to the send adapter for delivery.  
  
-   Interchange Control Count (Groups/Messages in X12 respectively) = Data  
  
-   Interchange Send Port ID = Data  
  
## Data Stored by the Receive Pipeline for Each Technical Acknowledgment Received in Response to an Outbound Interchange  
 The receive pipeline creates a record in the status report data store for each technical acknowledgment that it receives. The receive pipeline creates a record of each interchange received in the status report data store. creates one technical acknowledgment status report entry in the data store for each technical ACK received as a response to an interchange sent to a trading partner. The technical acknowledge is the TA1 for X12 and the CONTRL message with only the UCI Segment for EDIFACT. The data stored includes:  
  
-   Record Type = Interchange ACK Status  
  
-   Interchange ACK Direction = Send – Update Data  
  
-   Interchange Receiver = Update Data (required for correlation)  
  
-   Interchange Sender = Update Data (required for correlation)  
  
-   Interchange Date = Update Data (required for X12 correlation)  
  
-   Interchange Control ID = Update Data (required for correlation)  
  
-   Interchange ACK Status = Generated or Not Applicable \<Refer Note 0\> - Update Data  
  
-   Interchange ACK Control ID= Not valued – will be applied by send side  
  
-   Interchange ACK Date = Not valued – will be applied by send side  
  
-   Interchange ACK Time = Not valued – will be applied by send side  
  
-   ACK/Action Code = Update Data  \<refer note 1\> (from X12-TA104 or EDIFACT-UCI4)*  
  
-   ACK Note Code = Update Data \<Refer Note 2\> (from X12-TA105, not applicable for EDIFACT)*  
  
 The following ACK/Action Codes are used:  
  
|Data in ACK/Action Code|Error description for Reporting|Comment (applicability)|  
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------|  
|A|Accepted|X12|  
|E|Accepted, errors noted|X12|  
|P|Partially Accepted|X12|  
|R|Rejected|X12|  
|4|Rejected|EDIFACT|  
|8|Accepted/Partially Accepted|EDIFACT|  
  
 The following ACK Note Codes are used:  
  
|Data in ACK Note Code (in X12)|Description|

## Data Updated by the Receive Pipeline for Each Technical Acknowledgment Received in Response to an Outbound Interchange  
 For each technical acknowledgment that the receive pipeline receives, it updates the status report entry for the correlated sent interchange.  
  
 The EDI Disassembler locates records in the data store using data in the UCI and TA1 Segments of the incoming acknowledgment, as follows:  
  
|Fields in ACK|Fields in Data store|Comment|  
|-------------------|--------------------------|-------------|  
|Interchange Sender ID|Interchange Receiver|-|  
|Interchange Receiver ID|Interchange Sender|-|  
|-|Interchange Date|-|  
|Interchange Control Number|Interchange Control ID|-|  
|-|Interchange Direction = Send|Required in preserved batch scenario for uniqueness|  
|Record Type|Interchange Status and Interchange ACK Status|-|  
  
 The data stored includes:  
  
-   Interchange ACK Direction = Receive – Existing Data  
  
-   Interchange ACK Status = Received  
  
-   Interchange Receiver = Existing Data  
  
-   Interchange Sender = Existing Data  
  
-   Interchange Date = Existing Data  
  
-   Interchange Control ID = Existing Data  
  
-   Interchange ACK Control ID= Update Data  
  
-   Interchange ACK Date = Update Data  
  
-   Interchange ACK Time = Update Data  
  
-   ACK/Action Code = Update Data (from X12-TA104 or EDIFACT-UCI4)* \<Refer Note 1\>  
  
-   ACK Note Code 2 = Update Data (from X12-TA105 and not valued for EDIFACT)* \<Refer Note 2\>  
  
 The data from the ACK X12:TA1-104 or EDIFACT UCI4 is to be mapped as follows:  
  
|Data in ACK/Action Code|Mapped for Status Reporting|Comment|  
|------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------|  
|A|Accepted|X12|  
|P|Partially Accepted|X12|  
|R, M, W, X|Rejected|X12|  
|E|Accepted with errors|X12|  
|4|Rejected|EDIFACT|  
|7, 8|Accepted/Partially Accepted|EDIFACT|  
  
 The following ACK Note Codes are used:
