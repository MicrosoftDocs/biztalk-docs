# How to Customize General Settings in BizTalk Mapper
You can change the default settings of certain view options in a map. These settings would be available to you whenever you open Visual Studio. This topic provides information on such options.  
  
 You can also set the default settings for colors and fonts. For information on how to choose the settings, see [How to Customize Colors and Font in BizTalk Mapper](../core/how-to-customize-colors-and-font-in-biztalk-mapper.md).  
  
## Prerequisites  
 These options require that BizTalk Mapper is running.  
  
### To customize the general settings  
  
1. In [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)], on the **Tools** menu, click **Options**.  
  
    Alternatively, you can hold down the ALT key and press TO from the keyboard. For a list of Mapper keyboard shortcuts, see [BizTalk Mapper Keyboard Shortcuts](../core/biztalk-mapper-keyboard-shortcuts.md).  
  
2. In the **Options** dialog box, in the left pane, expand the **BizTalk Mapper** node, and then click **General**.  
  
3. Click the checkbox to enable/disable one or more of the following view options:  
  
   -   Automatic scrolling  
  
   -   Optimized display of links  
  
   -   Highlighting the relevant links for an item  
  
   -   Relevance view  
  
   -   Confirmation message for moving a relationship to another grid page  
  
   -   Confirmation message for search traversal from beginning/end.  
  
   -   Preferred script for script functoids  
  
   -   Search defaults for source schema, destination schema, and also functoid names, labels, comments, inputs, and scripts.  
  
4. Click **OK**. The settings are saved as default.  
  
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   >  If you do not want to use the customized settings, click **Restore Defaults** in the **Options** dialog box.
