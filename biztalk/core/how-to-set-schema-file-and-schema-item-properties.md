# How to Set Schema File and Schema Item Properties
Both schema file properties and item properties are set in the [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] Properties window. This topic describes the steps required to examine and/or set schema file/item properties.  
  
### To set schema file properties in the Properties window  
  
1.  In Solution Explorer, right-click the schema for which you want to examine and/or set the relevant properties, and then click **Properties**.  
  
     You can examine and/or set the properties of interest. For information about the properties available for a BizTalk schema, see [Schema File Properties](../core/schema-file-properties.md).  
  
2.  In the Visual Studio Properties window, set the desired schema file properties and press ENTER.  
  
### To set schema item properties in the Properties window  
  
1.  In Solution Explorer, select the schema for which you want to examine and/or set the relevant properties.  
  
2.  If necessary, press F4 to open the [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] Properties window.  
  
3.  In the Properties window, examine and/or set the properties of interest. For information about the properties available in the Properties window for a BizTalk schema, see [Node Properties - By Node Type](../core/node-properties-by-node-type.md).  
  
     Any new property values you set are effective immediately without any requirement to approve or cancel the changes you have made.
