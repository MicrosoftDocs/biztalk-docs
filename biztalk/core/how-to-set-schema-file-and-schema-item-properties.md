# How to Set Schema File and Schema Item Properties
Both schema file properties and item properties are set in the [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] Properties window. This topic describes the steps required to examine and/or set schema file/item properties.  
  
## Set schema file properties in the Properties window  
  
1. In Solution Explorer, right-click the schema for which you want to examine and/or set the relevant properties, and then click **Properties**.  
  
    You can examine and/or set the properties of interest. For information about the properties available for a BizTalk schema, see the **Schema File Properties** [!INCLUDE[ui-guidance-developers-reference](../includes/ui-guidance-developers-reference.md)].
  
2. In the Visual Studio Properties window, set the desired schema file properties and press ENTER.  
  
## Set schema item properties in the Properties window  
  
1. In Solution Explorer, select the schema for which you want to examine and/or set the relevant properties.  
  
2. If necessary, press F4 to open the [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] Properties window.  
  
3. In the Properties window, examine and/or set the properties of interest. For information about the properties available in the Properties window for a BizTalk schema, see **[Node Properties - By Node Type** [!INCLUDE[ui-guidance-developers-reference](../includes/ui-guidance-developers-reference.md)].
  
    Any new property values you set are effective immediately without any requirement to approve or cancel the changes you have made.
