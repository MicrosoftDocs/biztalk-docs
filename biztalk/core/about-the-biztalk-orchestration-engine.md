# About the BizTalk Orchestration Engine
At run time, the BizTalk Orchestration Engine executes XLANG/s files that are produced by BizTalk Orchestration Designer. Orchestration Designer is a rich graphical tool for visually designing business processes. It generates XLANG/s files that have an .odx extension and contain additional visualization information in their headers and custom attribute information in their bodies.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  XLANG/s can be viewed as a messaging language with some of the expression capabilities of C#.  
  
 The primary functions of the orchestration engine are:  
  
-   Persistence  
  
-   Hosting the .NET components  
  
-   Transactions  
  
-   Large message support  
  
-   Runtime validation  
  
-   Load throttling
