# Managing Groups
This section provides procedures for managing a BizTalk group. You use the BizTalk Server group to represent a unit of organization—such as an enterprise, department, or hub—that requires a contained Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] implementation. The BizTalk Management (BizTalkMgmtDb) database stores configuration information for the BizTalk group and the servers in that group. For more information about the BizTalk group, see [BizTalk Groups](../core/biztalk-groups.md).
