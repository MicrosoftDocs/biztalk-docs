# How to Open the Promote Properties Dialog Box
Property promotion is managed in the **Promote Properties** dialog box. This topic provides step-by-step instructions for opening this dialog box to manage your promoted properties.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  When you use the **Quick Promotion** feature of BizTalk Editor, you add a new **Property Field** promotion without needing to open the **Promote Properties** dialog box, although the promotion will be visible in that dialog box the next time it is opened.  
  
 There are two ways to open the Promote Properties dialog box.  
  
### To open the Promote Properties dialog box from the Schema node  
  
1.  In the schema tree, select the **\<Schema\>** node.  
  
2.  In the Properties window, click the ellipsis (**...**) button in the value field of the **Promote Properties** property.  
  
     The **Promote Properties** dialog box opens.  
  
### To open the Promote Properties dialog box from any node  
  
1.  In the schema tree, select any node.  
  
2.  Right-click the selected node, click **Promote**, and then click **Show Promotions**  
  
     The **Promote Properties** dialog box opens.
