## Explanation  
 This Warning event indicates that SSO has re-established contact with the SSO database, but was unable to open the replay or progress file. If SSO cannot open a replay file, it will proceed to the next replay file.  

 Replay files are used by password sync when the ENTSSO server cannot contact the SSO database. A progress file indicates how far through SSO was able to read the replay file in-case contact with the SSO database is lost again part-way through playing back of a replay file.  

## User Action  
 To resolve this Warning event, do the following:  

- You should check the System and Application Event logs for associated events to determine why SSO was unable to contact the SSO database.
