# Using BizTalk Mapper Commands
When BizTalkMapper becomes active, it adds a menu called **BizTalk** to the Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] shell. This menu provides access to the BizTalk Mapper commands and their functionality. When BizTalk Mapper is active, the **BizTalk** menu provides the commands that are specific to editing BizTalk maps.  

 Where applicable, BizTalk Mapper uses existing [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] menu items for commands that have obvious parallels to standard application functionality. For example, when BizTalk Mapper is active, the **Save** command on the **File** menu saves changes to the map that is currently being edited.  

 The following table describes the commands within BizTalk Mapper that can be used in the process of developing maps.

This is because the recursive process expands only the first occurrence of a given complex type. You must manually expand later occurrences of the same type. This behavior is designed to optimize performance when expanding nodes in large and complex schemas. |
