# How to Configure a Strong Name Assembly Key File
In the process of deploying a BizTalk solution, [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] first builds the assemblies. The deployment process requires that each assembly is strongly signed. You can strongly sign your assemblies by associating the project with a strong name assembly key file. If you haven't already done so, before deploying a solution from [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)], use the following procedure to generate a strong name assembly key file and assign it to each project in the solution.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform the procedure in this topic, you must be logged on with an account that is a member of the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administrator's group. In addition, your account must have Write permissions on the global assembly cache (GAC). The Administrators account on the local computer has this permission.  
  
### To configure a strong name assembly key file  
  
1.  Start **Visual Studio Command Prompt**.  
  
2.  At the command prompt, from the folder where you want to store the key file, type the following command, and then press ENTER:  
  
     **sn /k**  *file_name* **.snk**  
  
     Example: **sn /k ErrorHandling.snk**  
  
     A confirmation message, **Key pair written to** \<*file_name*\>**.snk**`,` displays on the command line.  
  
3.  In [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] Solution Explorer, right-click the project and then click **Properties**.  
  
4.  Click the **Signing** tab and choose **Browse** in the **Choose a strong name key file** drop down box.  
  
5.  Browse to the key file and click it. Click **Open**, and then close the project properties.  
  
6.  Repeat steps 3 through 6 for each project in the solution that you want to deploy using this strong name assembly key file.
