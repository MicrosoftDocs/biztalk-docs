## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that the receive pipeline could not process the incoming interchange because the interchange contained more instances of a segment than allowed by the schema.  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, make sure that the interchange does not have more than the maximum allowed number of segments, and then resend the interchange.
