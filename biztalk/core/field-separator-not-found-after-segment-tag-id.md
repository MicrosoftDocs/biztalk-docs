|Message Text|Field separator not found after segment tag id|  
  
## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that the receive pipeline could not process the interchange because the interchange contained a segment that had a segment identifier without a data element separator immediately following it.  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, ensure that all segment identifiers in the interchange have data element separators immediately following them, and then have the interchange resent.
