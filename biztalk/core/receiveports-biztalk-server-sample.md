# ReceivePorts (BizTalk Server Sample)
The ReceivePorts sample demonstrates how to create a new receive port by using the **ExplorerOM** administrative classes.  
  
## Prerequisites  
  
-   You must have [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] administrative privileges to use the administrative objects in this sample.  
  
-   The Windows PowerShell script requires the Windows PowerShell execution policy to allow script execution. For more information see [Examining the Execution Policy](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=128930).  
  
## What This Sample Does  
 This sample demonstrates using the **BtsCatalogExplorer** and **ReceivePort** classes from the **Microsoft.BizTalk.ExplorerOM** namespace to add a new receive port to [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)]. The sample is written in Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsVCSharp](../includes/btsvcsharp-md.md)]. A Windows PowerShell example script is also included in this topic. The sample demonstrates the following operations:  
  
-   Connecting to the BizTalk Management database by using the **BtsCatalogExplorer** class.  
  
-   Adding a new receive port by using the **AddNewReceivePort** method.  
  
-   Enumerating receive ports.  
  
-   Deleting receive ports.  
  
## Where To Find This Sample  
 The sample is located in the following SDK location:  
  
 \<*Samples Path*\>\Admin\ExplorerOM\ReceivePorts  
  
 The following table shows the files in this sample and describes their purpose.  
  
|File(s)|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|ReceivePorts.cs|[!INCLUDE[btsVCSharp](../includes/btsvcsharp-md.md)] source file for operations demonstrated in this sample.|  
|ReceivePorts.sln and ReceivePorts.csproj|Solution and project file for the sample.|  
  
## Building and Running This Sample  
  
#### To build this sample  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)], open the solution file ReceivePorts.sln.  
  
2.  On the **Build** menu, click **Build Solution**.  
  
#### To run this sample  
  
1.  Open a command window and navigate to the following folder:  
  
     \<*Samples Path*\>\Admin\ExplorerOM\ReceivePorts\bin\Debug  
  
2.  Run the file ReceivePorts.exe. The new receive port should be created and shown in the port enumeration. After the enumeration the receive port is immediately removed.  
  
## Windows PowerShell Script Example  
 The following Windows PowerShell example script can be used to demonstrate the same features of the **ExplorerOM** classes:
