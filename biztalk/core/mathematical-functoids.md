# Mathematical Functoids

## Overview
**Mathematical** functoids are used to perform a variety of basic mathematical operations.  
  
 The number of input parameters to the **Mathematical** functoids varies from functoid to functoid, and where reasonable, these functoids accept large numbers of inputs. For example, the **Division** functoid requires exactly two input parameters (the dividend and the divisor), while the **Addition** functoid accepts between 2 and 100 input parameters, resulting in their sum.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Because Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] uses the underlying functionality of the .NET Framework, the results produced by some of the **Mathematical** functoids may vary from the equivalent functoids in previous versions of BizTalk Server. Test your maps thoroughly to be sure you are getting the results you expect.  

## Functoids list  
 The **Mathematical** functoids are: 

* Absolute Value
* Addition
* Division
* Integer
* Maximum Value
* Minimum Value
* Modulo
* Multiplication
* Round
* Square Root
* Subtraction

More info on these functoids is [!INCLUDE[ui-guidance-developers-reference](../includes/ui-guidance-developers-reference.md)].
