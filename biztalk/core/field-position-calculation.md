# Field Position Calculation

## Overview
When you use the **Positional Length** and **Positional Offset** properties of the **Field Element** and **Field Attribute** nodes in your schema to define the layout of the positional records in your flat file message, the **Start Position** and **Length** columns of the **Flat File** tab in BizTalk Editor show the calculated starting positions and lengths, respectively, of the relevant fields and records.  

> [!NOTE]
>  The **Flat File** tab appear as an alternate tabbed view with the XSD view in BizTalk Editor when you have configured the flat file extension using the **Schema Editor Extensions** property of the **Schema** node. More details on this property [!INCLUDE[ui-guidance-developers-reference](../includes/ui-guidance-developers-reference.md)].

 In general, the starting position of a particular field *N* is the starting position of the previous field, plus the length of the previous field, plus the (positional) offset you have specified for field *N*.  

 All field position calculation in Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] is performed automatically, on-the-fly, without any need to execute a command (as was required in previous versions of BizTalk Server).
