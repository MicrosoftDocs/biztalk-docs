# Communication Direction
Each *port* has its own communication direction. The communication direction is used in combination with the communication pattern of the port's type to complete the definition of how a port can be used. The communication direction, or polarity, determines in which direction messages will be transmitted over that port.  
  
 If the port's type has a one-way communication pattern, its communication direction can be either Send or Receive. If the port's type has a two-way (request-response) communication pattern, its communication direction can be Send-Receive, in which a request is sent and a response is received, or Receive-Send, in which a request is received and a response is sent.
