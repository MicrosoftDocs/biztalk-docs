## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates BizTalk Server could not process the incoming AS2 message because the message did not contain an AS2-From header indicating the source of the message. An AS2 message must have an AS2-From header. The message will be suspended if it does not have an AS2-From header.  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, do the following:  
  
-   Ensure the sending party adds an AS2-To header to the HTTP, AS2, and MIME header of the AS2 message before sending it.
