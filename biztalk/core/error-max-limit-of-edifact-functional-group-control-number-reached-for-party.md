|  Message Text   | Max limit of acceptable Edifact functional group control number has reached for party {0}. Reset counter by navigating to Party in receiver role screen, field UNG 5 in Partner Agreement manager |
  
## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that the send pipeline could not process the outgoing EDIFACT interchange because the group control number in the UNG5 field specified in the party settings, specifically the reference number in field UNG5.2, was greater than the maximum allowable value. The maximum allowable value for the group control number depends upon the values of the three fields in UNG5. The maximum number of characters is 14 for the reference number in field UNG5.2, 13 for the prefix in UNG5.1 and 13 for the suffix in UNG5.3, and 14 for all three fields combined.  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, reset the reference number field (UNG5.2) of the group control number, as follows:  
  
1.  In the EDI Properties dialog box for the party resolved for the interchange, open the UNG and UNH Segment Definition page for the party as interchange receiver.  
  
2.  Click the Edit field associated with the UNG5 field.  
  
3.  Set the middle field of the group control number (the reference number in UNG5.2) to a new value such that the field has an acceptable number of digits.
