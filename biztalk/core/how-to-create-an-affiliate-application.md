# How to Create an Affiliate Application
You can use the MMC Snap-In or this command to create one or more applications, as specified by the XML file. An example XML file for Windows Initiated SSO is:  
  
```  
<sso>  
<application name="SAP">  
<description>The SAP application</description>   
<contact>someone@example.com</contact>   
<appuserAccount>domain\AppUserAccount</appuserAccount>   
<appAdminAccount>domain\AppAdminAccount</appAdminAccount>   
<field ordinal="0" label="User Id" masked="no" />   
<field ordinal="1" label="Password" masked="yes" />   
<flags groupApp="no" configStoreApp="no" allowTickets="no" validateTickets="yes" allowLocalAccounts="no" timeoutTickets="yes" adminAccountSame="no" enableApp="no" />  
</application>  
</sso>  
  
```  
  
 After you create an affiliate application, you cannot modify the following properties:  
  
-   Name of the affiliate application  
  
-   Fields associated with the affiliate application  
  
-   Affiliate application type (host group, individual, or configuration store)  
  
-   Administration account same as affiliate administrators group. (Specifying this flag will always use the affiliate administrators group as the administrator account for this affiliate application)  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  You can use local accounts for the administration account and user account by setting the allowLocalAccounts flag to yes. However, you should only use this flag in single-computer scenarios.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  You must be an SSO administrator or SSO affiliate administrator to perform this task.  
  
 After you create the affiliate application, you must enable it. For more information, see [How to Enable an Affiliate Application](../core/how-to-enable-an-affiliate-application.md).
