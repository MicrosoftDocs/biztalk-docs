# Custom Party Resolution (BizTalk Server Sample)
The Custom Party Resolution sample demonstrates how to write a custom pipeline component to resolve a custom party.  
  
## What This Sample Does  
 The Custom Party Resolution sample accomplishes its task using the following sequence of steps:  
  
1.  An XML document is retrieved from a folder.  
  
2.  The pipeline resolves the party.  
  
3.  The XML message is written to a folder.
