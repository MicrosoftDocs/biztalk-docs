# Managing Maps Within Projects
This section provides step-by-step instructions for working with entire mapsâ€”for example, the steps involved in creating a map, specifying the schemas in the map, and saving maps. For information about building the mapping structure using links and functoids, see [Using Functoids to Create More Complex Mappings](../core/using-functoids-to-create-more-complex-mappings.md).
