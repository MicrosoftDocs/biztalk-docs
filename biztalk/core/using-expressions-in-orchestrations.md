# Using Expressions in Orchestrations
You can use BizTalk Expression Editor to enter XLANG/s expressions to add logic to manipulate and test the values of your orchestration variables and messages. However, it is not a good practice to use it to perform high-level orchestration logic, which preferably would be visible in the orchestration drawing itself. For business process transparency and ease of reconfiguration, we recommend that you use simple and modular expressions.
