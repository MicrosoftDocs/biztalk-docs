## Explanation  
 This error indicates the port name or the operation name of two different ports that are being merged have the same name.  
  
## User Action  
 Using the Port Configuration Wizard, ensure that all the ports that are being merged have different port names and operation.  
  
 For additional information on port configuration, see the following resource in the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Help:
