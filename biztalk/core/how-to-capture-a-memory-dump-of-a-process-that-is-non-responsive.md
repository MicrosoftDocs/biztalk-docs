# How to Capture a Memory Dump of a Process that is Non Responsive
The BizTalk process BTSNTSvc.exe is defined as **hanging** when the process seems to stop responding. Common symptoms of a process hang include:  
  
- Orchestrations appear to stop running.  
  
- Messages arenâ€™t being processed.  
  
- General timeout issues occur.  
  
- The BizTalk process BTSNTSvc.exe consumes an unusually high amount of CPU cycles as viewed in the **Processes** tab of **Task Manager**.  
  
  To capture a memory dump of a hanging BTSNTSvc.exe process, follow these steps.  
  
### To configure the Debug Diagnostics tool to capture a hang dump  
  
1.  Launch the Debug Diagnostics tool from **Start**, **All Programs**, **IIS Diagnostics**, **Debug Diagnostics Tools**, **Debug Diagnostics Tool 1.0**.  
  
2.  If the **Select Rule Type** dialog of the Rules Configuration Wizard is displayed, click the **Cancel** button.  
  
3.  Click the **Processes** tab of the Debug Diagnostic Tool.  
  
4.  Right click the unresponsive BTSNTSvc.exe process and select **Create Full Userdump**. By default, a memory dump of the process will be saved to the \Program Files\IIS Resources\DebugDiag\Logs\Misc directory of the local computer.
