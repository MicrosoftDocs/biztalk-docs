# Publishing Service Metadata for the WCF Receive Adapters
You can use the BizTalk WCF Service Publishing Wizard to create WCF services for publishing service metadata for existing WCF receive locations. To generate client service model code from the published metadata documents you can use the Service Model Metadata Utility tool (SvcUtil.exe) included in the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) and .NET Framework Runtime Components.  

> [!NOTE]
>  Before you publish service metadata for the WCF adapters, you must create the WCF receive locations by using the BizTalk Administration console or the BTSTask command-line tool included with BizTalk Server. For more information about how to create a WCF receive location, see the appropriate topic for each WCF adapter in [WCF Adapters](../core/wcf-adapters.md).  

## IIS versions

 The WCF service that publishes service metadata can be running on the IIS version included with the operating system.

-   **IIS** provides the advanced process model. The published BizTalk WCF services must run in ASP.NET Compatibility Mode. The service metadata published by Web applications in IIS for the WCF receive adapters can be accessed over the HTTP transport.  

## Publish service metadata for the WCF receive locations

 To publish service metadata for the WCF receive locations, you must use the BizTalk WCF Service Publishing Wizard to create a Web application to host WCF services that provide the service metadata. This allows a receive location to be called as if it were a WCF service.  The BizTalk WCF Service Publishing Wizard generates the following files in the root folder of the created Web application:

You can use a metadata import tool (such as SvcUtil.exe) to generate the client code required to call this service in the development environment. The address at which the metadata is published is the endpoint address of the WCF service plus a **?wsdl** query string. **Note:**  The default metadata binding generated by the BizTalk WCF Publishing Wizard is not secure and it allows anonymous access to the metadata. The service metadata contains a detailed description about the service and may intentionally or unintentionally contain sensitive information. To protect service metadata from unauthorized access, you can modify Web.config to use a secure binding for your metadata endpoint. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
