# CSOM: SharePoint Services Adapter
Using the [!INCLUDE[btsSharePointSvcsNoVersion](../includes/btssharepointsvcsnoversion-md.md)] adapter, you can receive messages from [!INCLUDE[btsSharePointSvcsNoVersion](../includes/btssharepointsvcsnoversion-md.md)] and send messages to [!INCLUDE[btsSharePointSvcsNoVersion](../includes/btssharepointsvcsnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[btsSharePointSvcsNoVersion](../includes/btssharepointsvcsnoversion-md.md)] Adapter uses the [!INCLUDE[btsSharePointSvcsNoVersion](../includes/btssharepointsvcsnoversion-md.md)] Client Side Object Model (CSOM), which is ***automatically*** installed when [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] is installed. There are no additional installation steps on the [!INCLUDE[btsSharePointSvcsNoVersion](../includes/btssharepointsvcsnoversion-md.md)] computer.  
  
 We recommend using the Client Side Object Model (CSOM) of the [!INCLUDE[btsSharePointSvcsNoVersion](../includes/btssharepointsvcsnoversion-md.md)] Adapter.  
  
 [Appendix B: Install the Microsoft SharePoint Adapter](../install-and-config-guides/appendix-b-install-the-microsoft-sharepoint-adapter.md) provides more information on the [!INCLUDE[btsSharePointSvcsNoVersion](../includes/btssharepointsvcsnoversion-md.md)] installation.
