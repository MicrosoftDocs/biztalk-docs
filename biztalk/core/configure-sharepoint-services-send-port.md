# Configure SharePoint Services Send Port
This topic compares a Static Send Port with a Dynamic Send Port and also lists the steps to create a [!INCLUDE[btsWinSharePointSvcsNoVersion](../includes/btswinsharepointsvcsnoversion-md.md)] send port. Specifically:

##  <a name="BKMK_StaticSend"></a> Create a Static Send Port
 When creating a Static Send Port, the send port uses the default Send Handler associated with Transport Type. When using the [!INCLUDE[btsWinSharePointSvcsNoVersion](../includes/btswinsharepointsvcsnoversion-md.md)] adapter, the default Send Handler is **BizTalkServerApplication**. For the steps to add a new Send Handler, go to [How to Create an Adapter Handler](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=263646).

 Create the Static Send Port:

1. In the **BizTalk Server Administration** console, expand **BizTalk Group [*GroupName*]**, expand **Applications**, and then expand the application to contain the send port.

2. Right-click **Send Ports**, click **New**, and then click **Static One-way Send Port**.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   >  A **Static Solicit-Response Send Port** is not configurable with the [!INCLUDE[btsWinSharePointSvcsNoVersion](../includes/btswinsharepointsvcsnoversion-md.md)] adapter.

3. In  **Properties**, click **Windows SharePoint Services** in the **Type** drop-down list. Enter the **Name**, **Send Handler**, and **Send Pipeline** properties.

4. Click **Configure**. In  **Properties**, configure the following:

Expressions include any mix of literals, macros, and XPATH queries. For example, enter **PurchOrd-%XPATH=//po:PurchaseOrderId%-%MessageID%.xml**. When no file name is supplied, the file name of the original file, the value supplied by the orchestration, or 'Msg-%MessageID%.xml' is used. See [Windows SharePoint Services Adapter Expressions](../core/windows-sharepoint-services-adapter-expressions.md) for more information. **Note:**  When sending messages to a list, this Filename value is ignored and not saved in a SharePoint column. Instead, update the 'Title' column using one of the 16 columns available. SharePoint lists do not have a Filename column.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

##  <a name="BKMK_DynamicSend"></a> Create a Dynamic Send Port
 When creating a Dynamic Send Port, the Send Handler is configurable for every adapter. A single Dynamic Send Port can be used by multiple adapters. See [Dynamic Send Port Handler is Configurable](../core/dynamic-send-port-handler-is-configurable.md) for the steps to configure the Dynamic Send Port Handler.

1. In the **BizTalk Server Administration** console, expand **BizTalk Group [*GroupName*]**, expand **Applications**, and then expand the application to contain the send port.

2. Right-click **Send Ports**, click **New**, and then choose **Dynamic One-way Send Port** or **Dynamic Solicit-Response Send Port**

3. In  **Properties**, enter the **Name** and the **Pipeline** properties

    Click **Configure**.

4. In the **Configure Send Handler** window, choose the **Send Handler** for the individual adapters. The default Send Handler is **BizTalkServerApplication**. For the steps to add a new send handler, go to [How to Create an Adapter Handler](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=263646).

    There are many reasons to use separate hosts, including:

   - **32-bit Requirements**: Some adapters require a 32-bit host, like the FTP and POP3 adapters. You can group all or individual 32-bit adapters into their own host.

      [BizTalk Server 64-Bit Support](../core/biztalk-server-64-bit-support2.md)

   - **Host by purpose**: Create a host for sending, a host for receiving, a host for processing orchestrations, and a host for tracking.

   - **Different host settings**: Many settings are implemented at the host-level. As a result, different throttling settings are configurable for each host. For example, you can disable throttling on HostA. Track every event in HostB. Modify the .NET CLR settings for HostC. Increase memory usage on HostD.

   - **Security**: Security is implemented at the host-level. Each host runs under its own Windows account. For example, HostA uses the FILE adapter to access a file share. Give the HostA user account permissions to the file share. HostB uses a web service hosted on an IIS server. Give the HostB user account authorization to the web service. This also prevents other host accounts from accessing entities it doesnâ€™t need to access.

   - **Separate adapters**: For example, you have several artifacts (receive location and send ports) using the HTTP adapter. You want everything associated with the HTTP adapter in its own host.

   - **Separate orchestrations**: Individual orchestrations can be in their own host. For example, if an orchestration uses high memory or high CPU, then put that orchestration into its own host.
