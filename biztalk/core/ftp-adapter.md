# FTP Adapter
The FTP adapter exchanges data between an FTP server and Microsoft BizTalk Server, and allows for the integration of vital data stored on a variety of platforms with line-of-business applications. The adapter can connect to the FTP server via SOCKS4 or SOCKS5 proxy server.  
  
 The FTP adapter can transfer a large number of files from an FTP server to BizTalk Server. It can also transfer files as part of an orchestration.  
  
 The FTP adapter consists of two adapters â€” a receive adapter and a send adapter.  

This section describes the FTP receive and send adapters, as well as security and best-practice information.  
  
 ## Receive adapter  
  
 The FTP receive adapter enables you to move data from an FTP server to [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)]. Key features include:  
  
- Pulling files from the FTP server on demand  
  
- Running polls based on a configurable schedule  
  
- Polling the FTP server and sending data directly to [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)]  
  
- Specifying the FTP server as an IP address, port, password, and host name  
  
- Guaranteed file delivery  
  
   The FTP receive adapter also works with the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console and BizTalk Explorer to configure and administer each receive function, which is composed of the following configuration items:  
  
- Poll interval to run an FTP command (for example, 60 minutes)  
  
- Information with which to route the document to a specific BizTalk send port or receive location  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The FTP receive adapter does not support receiving files from a partitioned data set.  
  
## Send adapter  
  
 The FTP send adapter enables you to move data from [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] to an FTP server. Key features include:  
  
-   Ability to run sends on demand  
  
-   Guaranteed delivery
