# Step 3: How to Complete and Run the Project

After adding the assembly key and binding the ports, it is time to test the orchestration.  
  
For the testing you can use the sample Sample XML BeginDoc if you used the identical object. If not, you can [Step 4: Create a Sample XML BeginDoc](../core/step-4-create-a-sample-xml-begindoc2.md) as this is just a trigger to start the whole process.  
  
### To complete and run the project  
  
1. In the Solution Explorer, right-click your project, and then select **Build**.  
  
2. Right-click your project, and then select **Deploy**.  
  
3. In the BizTalk Explorer, select **Bind**, **Enlist** and **Start** to test your orchestration.
