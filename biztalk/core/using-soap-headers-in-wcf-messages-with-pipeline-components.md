# Using SOAP Headers in WCF Messages with Pipeline Components
You can set the custom SOAP headers with the WCF adapters in pipeline components. You use a combination of the context property name, **OutboundCustomHeaders**, and the target namespace **http://schemas.microsoft.com/BizTalk/2006/01/Adapters/WCF-properties**. When you use the **OutboundCustomHeaders** property, the property must have the \<**headers**\> element as the root element. All of the custom SOAP headers must be placed inside the \<**headers**\> element. If the custom SOAP header value is an empty string, you must assign \<**headers**\>\</**headers**\> or \<**headers**/\> to the **OutboundCustomHeaders** property. For more information about how to use SOAP headers with the WCF adapters, see the SDK sample, Using Custom SOAP Headers with the WCF Adapters, from [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=79960](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=79960).  
  
 The following code example sets custom SOAP headers in a send pipeline component for a property named **OutboundCustomHeaders**:  
  
```  
public IBaseMessage Execute(IPipelineContext pc, IBaseMessage inmsg)  
{  
   try  
      {  
       string stringVar = "<headers>  
             <Origination>Home</Origination>  
             <Destination>Work</Destination>  
          </headers>";  
inmsg.Context.Write("OutboundCustomHeaders","http://schemas.microsoft.com/BizTalk/2006/01/Adapters/WCF-properties", stringVar);  
      }  
   catch (Exception ex)  
      {  
   throw new Exception("Pipeline component exception - " + ex.Message);  
      }  
return inmsg;  
}  
```  
  
 For more information about pipeline components, see [Developing Custom Pipeline Components](../core/developing-custom-pipeline-components.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You must not set the standard SOAP headers that the WCF infrastructure uses for Web services standards such as WS-Addressing, WS-Security, and WS-AtomicTransaction.
