# How to Configure a Windows SharePoint Services Send Port
This topic describes how to create and configure a Windows SharePoint Services send port by using the BizTalk Server Administration Console.  

### To create and configure a Windows SharePoint Services send port  

1. In the BizTalk Server Administration Console, create a new send port or double-click an existing send port to modify it. For more information,see [How to Create a Send Port](../core/how-to-create-a-send-port2.md). Configure all of the send port options and specify **Windows SharePoint Services Transport Properties** for the **Type** option in the **Transport** section of the **General** tab.  

2. On the **General** tab, in the **Transport** section, next to **Type**, click **Configure**.  

3. In the **Windows SharePoint Services Transport Properties** dialog box, do the following:

By default, this is the Default Web Site configured on port 80. If you have configured the Windows SharePoint Services Web service on any other IIS Web site than the Default Web Site, you will have to update this value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

You may need to increase this value if the message or batch size is higher than the average that is expected by the adapter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
   |       Destination Folder URL        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The Windows SharePoint Services destination folder URL, relative to the SharePoint site. For example, Shared Documents, Shared Documents/Purchase Orders/, or Lists/Tasks. You can send messages to a SharePoint list by specifying the URL of the list, for example, Lists/Tasks. If you specify a list as a destination, the message body will not be saved with the list item but the values extracted from the message will still be promoted into the SharePoint columns. **Note:**  Sometimes the SharePoint document library, list, or folder URL is different from the name of that item. Check the address bar in Internet Explorer to find the correct URL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
   |              Filename               |                                                                                                                                                                                                     (Optional) The Windows SharePoint Services filename. You can type in a literal value like 'PurchaseOrder0001.xml' or an expression. Expressions can include any mix of literals, macros and XPATH queries, ex: "PurchOrd-%XPATH=//po:PurchaseOrderId%-%MessageID%.xml". When no file name is supplied, the file name will be the name of the original file, the value supplied by the orchestration, or 'Msg-%MessageID%.xml' if the orchestration does not define the file name. **Note:**  When sending messages to a list, the value specified in the Filename property is ignored and will not be saved in any SharePoint column. SharePoint lists do not have a Filename column. Instead, update the 'Title' column using one of the 16 columns available. <br /><br /> For more information about expressions, see [Windows SharePoint Services Adapter Expressions](../core/windows-sharepoint-services-adapter-expressions.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Use this field to define the namespace aliases that are used by the XPATH queries introduced in fields like 'Filename' or 'Column Value'. For example, po=`'http://OrderProcess/POrder'`, conf=`'http://OrderProcess/Confirmation'` xmlns=""; ipsol='{D8217CF1-4EF7-4bb5-A30D-765ECB09E0D9}'. **Note:**  This property does not override the WSS.ConfigNamespacesAliases message context property defined by the orchestration. The two values are merged instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Select 'Yes' to overwrite existing files. Select 'No' to raise an error and suspend the message when a file with the same name already exists. Select 'Rename' to rename the file. Select 'Orchestration' to use the value defined by the orchestration. **Caution:**  Sending a large number of messages with the same name while the Overwrite property is set to 'Yes' could result in SharePoint errors being logged in the Event Viewer. These errors do not affect the functionality of the adapter. Any message that fails will be retried.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

   | Templates Fallback Document Library | Enter the name of a SharePoint document library where the InfoPath solutions are stored.  For example, Templates. The adapter will only search this document library for a matching InfoPath solution if a solution is not found in the templates document library. The 'Templates Fallback Document Library' and 'Templates Document Library' fields can be used with two sets of InfoPath solutions. There are generic InfoPath solutions that work for all general purposes, and specialized InfoPath solutions that are used only for a particular partner. The 'Templates Fallback Document Library' field should point to the generic solutions, and the 'Templates Document Library' should point to the specialized solutions for that particular partner. **Note:**  This field is required when the Templates Fallback Namespace Column field is not empty. **Note:**  The document library must have at least one SharePoint column of type 'Single line of text' which is populated with the namespace and the root node of the XML documents that can be opened with this InfoPath solution, or just the root node.
