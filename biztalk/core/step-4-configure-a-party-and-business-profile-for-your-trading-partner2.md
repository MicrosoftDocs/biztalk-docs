# Step 4: Configure a Party and Business Profile for Your Trading Partner

![Step 4 of 11](../core/media/tut-step4-of-11.gif "Tut_Step4_of_11")  
  
 In this step, you configure a party and business profile for your trading partner Fabrikam to send an 864 message to your organization and receive a 997 acknowledgment message and an asynchronous MDN in return.  
  
## Prerequisites
  
You must be logged on as a member of the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administrators group.  
  
### To configure a party and business profile for your trading partner  
  
1. Open the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration Console by clicking **Start**, pointing to **All Programs**, pointing to [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerStartMenuItemui](../includes/btsbiztalkserverstartmenuitemui-md.md)], and then clicking **BizTalk Server Administration**.  
  
2. In the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration Console, expand [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerAdminConsoleui](../includes/btsbiztalkserveradminconsoleui-md.md)], and then expand **BizTalk Group**. Right-click **Parties**, point to **New**, and then click **Party**.  
  
3. In the **Party Properties** dialog box, enter **Fabrikam** in the **Name** field.  
  
4. Clear the **Local BizTalk processes messages received by the party or supports sending messages from this party** check box. By clearing the check box you specify that the party (in this case, **Fabrikam**) does not host BizTalk Server.  
  
5. Click **OK**.  
  
6. Right-click the party name, point to **New**, and then click **Business Profile**.  
  
7. In the **Profile Properties** dialog box, on the **General** page, enter `Fabrikam_Profile` in the **Name** text box.  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   >  When you create a party, a profile is also created. You can rename and use that profile instead of creating a new one. To rename a profile, right-click the profile and select **Properties**. In the **General** page, specify a name for the profile.  
  
8. Click **OK**.  
  
## Next Steps
  
You configure the BTS ISAPI filter and the Fabrikam and Contoso Web pages in [Step 5: Configure the Trading Partner Web Pages](../core/step-5-configure-the-trading-partner-web-pages.md).
