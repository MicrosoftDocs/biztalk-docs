# Short-Term Facts vs. Long-Term Facts
Two types of facts are asserted into the working memory of the rule engineâ€”short-term facts and long-term facts.  
  
## Short-Term Facts  
 A short-term fact is specific to a single execution cycle of the rule engine. Short-term facts are retracted automatically from the working memory of the rule engine after the policy executes. If your data changes between execution cycles of the rule engine for a policy, you submit the data as a short-term fact to the rule engine.  
  
 Examples of short-term facts are:  
  
-   The facts you submit as parameters to the **Policy.Execute** method.  
  
-   The facts you submit as parameters to the **Call Rules** shape.  
  
-   The facts you submit from an action of a rule using the **Assert** function.  
  
## Long-Term Facts  
 A long-term fact is loaded into the working memory of the rule engine for use over an arbitrary number of execution cycles. Typically, long-term facts are slowly changing facts that do not typically change between executions of a policy. For example, you may want to create a database connection only once, and execute the policy several times by using the same database connection. The only real distinction between short-term facts and long-term facts is in implementation.  
  
 To submit a fact as a long-term fact, you need to perform the following steps:  
  
1. Create a fact retriever component that implements the **IFactRetriever** interface. Create and assert the fact into the working memory of the rule engine when the **UpdateFacts** method is invoked for the first time, and update the fact when necessary on subsequent invocations of the **UpdateFacts** method.  
  
2. Configure the policy to use the fact retriever component by using the Business Rule Composer.  
  
   For more information about creating a fact retriever and using it in a policy, see [How to Create a Fact Retriever](../core/how-to-create-a-fact-retriever.md).
