# Configuring Fallback Local Host Settings (EDIFACT-Transaction Set Settings)
To process an incoming interchange, [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] must determine the schema that it needs to use in processing and validating the interchange. This consists of determining the target namespace associated with the schema, and determining the schema to be used. In this page of fallback agreement, you enter the properties to be used in determining the target namespace. How BizTalk Server determines the schema is described in [Agreement Resolution, Schema Discovery, and Authorization for Received EDI Messages](../core/agreement-resolution-schema-discovery-and-authorization-for-received-edi.md).  
  
## Prerequisites  
 You must be logged on as a member of the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administrators or [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] B2B Operators group.  
  
### To configure local host settings for transaction sets  
  
1. In the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration Console, right-click the **Parties** node, and then click **EDIFACT Fallback Settings**.  
  
2. In the **EDIFACT Fallback Settings** dialog box, in the **EDIFACT Agreement Pages** tab, under the **Transaction Set Settings** section, click **Local Host Settings**.  
  
3. Select **Create empty XML tags for trailing separators** to have the interchange sender include empty XML tags for trailing separators.  
  
4. Select **Use Dot (.) as decimal separator** to enable BizTalk Server include a dot (.) in the XML message created out of an interchange that contains a decimal number.  
  
5. For **Target Namespace**, enter (or select from the drop-down list) the target namespace that [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] will use to determine the schema to process the received message with  
  
6. Click **Apply** to accept the changes before continuing with the configuration, or click **OK** to validate the changes and then close the dialog box.
