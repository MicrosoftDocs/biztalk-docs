# Reporting Mode in Orchestration Debugger
Reporting mode uses tracked events to show what has happened. It uses data tracked using the **Orchestration Events** option flag. This flag must be set prior to the execution of the orchestration instance. To enable event tracking for a particular orchestration, see [How to Configure Tracking for an Orchestration](../core/how-to-configure-tracking-for-an-orchestration.md).  
  
 The **Orchestration Events** option tracks the execution of each shape in the orchestration as it happens. In reporting mode, you can replay the steps or set breakpoints on the class of orchestration so that you can then debug new instances using interactive mode.  
  
 After you have executed the business process you are interested in, you can use one of the Reporting view queries for the orchestration you wish to examine.
