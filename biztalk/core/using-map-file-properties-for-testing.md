# Using Map File Properties for Testing

## Overview
The map properties, available by right-clicking on the map in the Solution Explorer, control many important behaviors during testing:  
  
- The validation of input and output instances against source and destination schemas  
  
- The choice of whether to create an input instance or use an existing one  
  
- The format of input and output test instances  
  
  For information about the map properties, see the **Map Property Reference** [!INCLUDE[ui-guidance-developers-reference](../includes/ui-guidance-developers-reference.md)].
