# Tracking Data Decode Services Performance Counters
Performance counters allow you to monitor specific aspects of work performed on the site or system by service. Performance counters can help you identify and troubleshoot server performance issues.  
  
 The following performance counters are accessible for each host instance under the **BizTalk:TDDS** performance object category:  
  
|**Category**|**Counter**|**Description**|

|BizTalk:TDDS|Batches being processed|The number of batches that are being processed inside the current SQL transaction.|  
||Batches committed|The number of batches committed to the destination database.|  
||Events being processed|The number of events that are being processed inside of the current SQL transaction.|  
||Event Committed|The number of events committed to the destination database within this second.|  
||Records being processed|The number of records that are being processed inside the current SQL transaction.|  
||Records Committed|The number of records committed to the destination database during this second.|  
||Total Batches|Total batches processed by TDDS.|  
||Total Events|Total events processed by TDDS.|
