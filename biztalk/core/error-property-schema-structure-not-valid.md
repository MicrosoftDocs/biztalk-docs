# Error - Property Schema Structure Not Valid
**Error Code**  
  
 BEC2007  
  
 **Explanation**  
  
 This property schema was found to have a structure that is not valid. The structure of property schemas is limited to one or more **Field Element** nodes as children of the **Schema** node.  
  
 **User Action**  
  
 Correct the structure of this property schema so that the **Schema** node only has **Field Element** nodes as children.
