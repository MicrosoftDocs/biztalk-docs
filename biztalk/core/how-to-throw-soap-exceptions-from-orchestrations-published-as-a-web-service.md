# How to Throw SOAP Exceptions from Orchestrations Published as a Web Service
You can return a SOAP exception from an orchestration that you have published as a Web service. You add a fault message to your SOAP port and send the fault message instead of the response.  
  
### To throw a SOAP exception from an orchestration published as a Web service  
  
1. Add a fault message to the SOAP port type. The message type for the fault message can be any XML Schema (XSD) compliant schema or simple type.  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   >  To return a string as a **SoapException** with error information, you can use the simple type string as the fault message type.  
  
2. In your orchestration, create the fault message.  
  
3. Use the **Send** shape to link to the fault operation in the SOAP port that corresponds to the fault message. A SOAP exception wraps the returned fault message.  
  
   If your orchestration does not return an error, use a different **Send** shape to send the standard SOAP response message using the usual response operation.
