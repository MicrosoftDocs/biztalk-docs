# Interfaces for an Asynchronous Batch-Supported Send Adapter
Batch-aware adapters may send messages synchronously or asynchronously, and may perform transacted sends. To send batches of messages, a send adapter must implement the following interfaces:  
  
- **IBTTransport**  
  
- **IBaseComponent**  
  
- **IBTTransportControl**  
  
- **IPersistPropertyBag**  
  
- **IBTBatchTransmitter**  
  
- **IBTTransmitterBatch**  
  
  For the asynchronous batch send, the Messaging Engine gets a batch from the adapter and adds messages to be transmitted to that batch. The messages are only sent when the Messaging Engine calls the **Done** method on the batch. The adapter returns `False` for each message that it intends to transmit asynchronously. The adapter then gets a batch from the adapter proxy and deletes those messages that it successfully transmitted.  
  
  The following figure shows the object interactions involved in creating an asynchronous batch-supported send adapter.
