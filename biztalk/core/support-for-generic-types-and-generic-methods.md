# Support for Generic Types and Generic Methods
The rule engine supports using specialized generic types and specialized generic methods in a rule. It does not support using generic types and generic methods themselves in a rule. For example, in a business rule you can use **List**\<*int*\>, but not **List**\<T\> (from the **System.Collections.Generic** namespace in the .NET class library). Currently, the Business Rule Composer tool does not support creating rules by using specialized generic types and specialized generic methods. You must create the rules programmatically by using the rule engine object model. The following sample code demonstrates how to use the **List** generic class in a business rule:  
  
```  
  
// Create the condition list IF 1 == 1  
Equal eq = new Equal(new Constant(1), new Constant(1));  
  
// Create the action list List<int>.Add(3)  
ActionCollection ac = new ActionCollection();  
  
//Create class binding and class member bindings  
ClassBinding lstClass = new ClassBinding(typeof(System.Collections.Generic.List<int>));  
ArgumentCollection argc = new ArgumentCollection();  
argc.Add(new Constant(3));  
ClassMemberBinding add = new ClassMemberBinding("Add", lstClass, argc);  
  
// Wrapping the .NET binding as a user function  
UserFunction uf = new UserFunction(add);  
ac.Add(uf);  
  
// Create the rule  
Rule rl = new Rule("AddToList", eq, ac);  
  
// Create the policy  
RuleSet rs = new RuleSet("GenericTest");  
rs.Rules.Add(rl);  
  
// Create the .NET List object  
List<int> lst = new List<int>();  
lst.Add(1);  
lst.Add(2);  
  
// Print the list before executing the policy  
Console.WriteLine("Contents of the lists before executing the policy");  
foreach (int i in lst)  
    Console.WriteLine(i);  
  
PolicyTester pt = new PolicyTester(rs);  
pt.Execute(lst);  
  
// Print the list after executing the policy  
Console.WriteLine("Contents of the lists before executing the policy");  
foreach (int i in lst)  
    Console.WriteLine(i);  
```
