# Batch Status Report
This report shows the activity of instances of the batching orchestration. Each row in the report indicates the status of the batches being processed by a single instance of the batching orchestration.  
  
 The status of preserved batches is not reported in the Batch Status Report, but is reported in the Interchange/ACK Status report.  
  
## Fields in the Status Report  
 The Batch Status Report displays the following information for batched interchanges:  
  
-   Batch Status  
  
-   Batch Name  
  
-   Destination Party Name  
  
-   Activation Time  
  
-   Batch Occurrence  
  
-   EDI Encoding Type  
  
-   Batch Type  
  
-   Batch Target  
  
-   Batch Element Count: how many batch elements have been accumulated by the batching orchestration instance  
  
-   Rejected Elements Count  
  
-   Latest Action: Can be Batch Activated, Scheduled Release, Count Based Release, Manual Override Release, Batch Terminated/Stop Release, Element Added, or External Release  
  
-   Interchange Control Number  
  
-   Interchange Date Time  
  
-   Batch Size (in characters) (not displayed by default)  
  
## View Related Interchanges Status Reports
