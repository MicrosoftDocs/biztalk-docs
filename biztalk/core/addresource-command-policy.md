# AddResource Command: Policy
To add a policy to a BizTalk application, you use the **AddResource** command and specify **System.BizTalk:Rules** for the Type parameter. Running this command adds the policy to the BizTalk Management database. The policy is also displayed in the BizTalk Server Administration console, in the Policies folder of the application to which you added it. In addition, the policy is listed when you use the [ListApp Command](../core/listapp-command.md).  
  
 For this command to succeed, the policy must exist in the Rule Engine database. For instructions on importing a policy into the Rule Engine database, see [How to Import a Policy](../core/how-to-import-a-policy.md). When you add a policy by using AddResource command, any vocabularies used by the policy are automatically added as well.  
  
## Usage  
 **BTSTask AddResource** [**/ApplicationName:**<em>value</em>] **/Type:System.BizTalk:Rules** [**/Overwrite**] **/Name:**<em>value</em>**/Version:**<em>value</em> [**/Server:**<em>value</em>] [**/Database:**<em>value</em>]
