# Warning - Envelope Schema Needs Root Record Node
**Error Code**  
  
 BEC1010  
  
 **Explanation**  
  
 Envelope schemas are required to have at least one root **Record** node as a child of its **Schema** node.  
  
 **User Action**  
  
 Right-click the **Schema** node, click **Insert Child Record** on the shortcut menu, and then type a descriptive name for the inserted **Record** node. In general, envelope schemas will also have additional nodes inserted within the root **Record** node.
