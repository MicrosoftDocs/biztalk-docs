# How to Create Affiliate Applications for Host Initiated SSO
You can define two types of applications:  
  
-   **Individual** There is a 1 to 1 relationship between Windows users and non-Windows users.  
  
-   **Host Group** Multiple non-Windows users can be mapped to the same Windows account.

2.  In the scope pane of the ENTSSO MMC Snap-In, expand the **Enterprise Single Sign-On** node.  
  
3.  Right-click **Affiliate Applications**, and then click **Create Application** to open the **Enterprise Single Sign-On Application Wizard**.  
  
4.  Use the wizard to select the properties of your affiliate application.
