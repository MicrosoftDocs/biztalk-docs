# How to Configure an Application
This topic describes how to use the BizTalk Server Administration console to configure the artifacts in an application, as follows:  

- Bind logical ports and role links to physical ports and parties.  

- Map orchestrations to the host under which they should execute.  

- Configure send and receive ports, send port groups, and receive port locations.  

  If the application does not contain at least one orchestration, send port, send port group, receive port, or receive location, the information in this topic does not apply.  

  After completing this configuration, you will be able to start the application, as described in [How to Start and Stop a BizTalk Application](../core/how-to-start-and-stop-a-biztalk-application.md).  

> [!NOTE]
>  You can also configure artifacts individually from within the application. For more information on configuring individual artifacts, see the links at the end of this topic.  

## Prerequisites  
 To perform the procedure in this topic, you must be logged on with an account that is a member of the BizTalk Server Administrators group. For more detailed information on permissions, see [Permissions Required for Deploying and Managing a BizTalk Application](../core/permissions-required-for-deploying-and-managing-a-biztalk-application.md).  

### To configure an application  

1. Click **Start**, point to **Programs**, point to [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerStartMenuItemui](../includes/btsbiztalkserverstartmenuitemui-md.md)], and then click **BizTalk Server Administration**.  

2. In the console tree, expand  **BizTalk Server Administration**, right-click the application, and then click **Configure**.  

3. In the **Orchestrations** list in the left pane, click an orchestration, configure properties as described in the following table, and then click **OK**. If there are no orchestrations in this application, the **Orchestrations** list does not display.

   |        **Bindings - Receive Ports**        |     From the drop-down list, select the physical receive port that you want to bind to the corresponding inbound logical port. This list includes ports in the current application as well as ports in any referenced applications.     |
   |   **Bindings - Outbound Logical Ports**    |                                                              Displays the name of a logical outbound port. Logical ports are found on the port surfaces in orchestrations.                                                              |
   | **Bindings - Send Ports/Send Port Groups** | From the drop-down list, select the send port or send port group that you want to bind to the corresponding outbound logical port. This list includes ports in the current application as well as ports in any referenced applications. |


4. In the **Messaging** list in the left pane, click **Send Ports and Send Port Groups**, configure properties as described in the following table, and then click **OK**. This list displays all of the send ports and send port groups in the current application.
