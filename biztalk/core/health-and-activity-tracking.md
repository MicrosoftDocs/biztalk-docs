# Health and Activity Tracking
The **Health and Activity Tracking (HAT)** tool was removed in [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] 2009.  The role of the HAT tool was to track and display information relating to live and historical message data stored in the BizTalk Tracking database.  The tool allowed debugging of the flow of an orchestration and the ability to view the flow of a message through a sequential display.  A Query Builder allowed standard and custom queries of the tracking data.  
  
 While the Health Activity Tracking tool is no longer invoked directly from the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] menu, its tracking functionality still indirectly exists from within the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] environment.  Health and activity information is available through improved integration and additional tracking queries within the Group Hub page in the BizTalk Server Administration console.  
  
 A majority of documentation surrounding tracking health and activity data can be found at [Viewing Tracked Message and Instance Data](../core/viewing-tracked-message-and-instance-data.md).  Some of the information in this section includes [Best Practices for Message and Instance Data Tracking](../core/best-practices-for-message-and-instance-data-tracking.md), [Understanding Tracked Data](../core/understanding-tracked-data.md), [Viewing Historical and Tracked Data](../core/viewing-historical-and-tracked-data.md), [Viewing Message Flow](../core/viewing-message-flow.md), and [Debugging an Orchestration](../core/debugging-an-orchestration.md).
