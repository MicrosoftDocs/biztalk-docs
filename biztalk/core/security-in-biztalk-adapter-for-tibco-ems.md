# Security in BizTalk Adapter for TIBCO EMS

## Overview
Microsoft BizTalk Adapter for TIBCO Enterprise Message Service provides Single Sign-On (SSO) support. An affiliate application created by Enterprise Single Sign-On tools represents a server system such as TIBCO Enterprise Message Service.  

This section provides guidelines on how to deploy BizTalk Adapter for TIBCO Enterprise Message Service in a secure environment.  
  
> [!CAUTION]
>  It is highly recommended that you restrict the use of BizTalk Adapter for Enterprise Message Service to authorized users only, as the client files directly connect to the line-of-business applications.
