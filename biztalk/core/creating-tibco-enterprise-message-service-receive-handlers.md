# Creating TIBCO Enterprise Message Service Receive Handlers
TIBCO Enterprise Message Service receiver is a listener service that registers a particular Queue or Topic and receives the relative messages. BizTalk Adapter for TIBCO Enterprise Message Service first registers with TIBCO Enterprise Message Service by opening a new session, and then it continues polling to receive messages.. This section explains how to set the receive port to connect to TIBCO Enterprise Message Service and how to include XML in your orchestration to interact with TIBCO EMS at run time.
