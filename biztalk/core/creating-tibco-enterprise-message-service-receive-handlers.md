# Create TIBCO EMS receive artifacts

## Overview
TIBCO Enterprise Message Service receiver is a listener service that registers a particular Queue or Topic and receives the relative messages. BizTalk Adapter for TIBCO Enterprise Message Service first registers with TIBCO Enterprise Message Service by opening a new session, and then it continues polling to receive messages.. This section explains how to set the receive port to connect to TIBCO Enterprise Message Service and how to include XML in your orchestration to interact with TIBCO EMS at run time.  

## Create a receive port  
  
1.  In the BizTalk Server Administration Console, expand **BizTalk Group**, expand **Applications**, and then expand your application.  
  
2.  Right-click **Receive Ports**, select **New**, and then click **One-way Receive Ports**.  
  
3.  In the **Receive Port Properties** window, on the **General** page, do the following:  
  
    1.  In the **Name** field, type `ReceiveFromTIBCOEMS`.  
  
    2.  In the **Authentication** group box, specify how messages are handled when using authentication.  
  
    3.  Select the **Enable routing for failed messages** checkbox.  
  
4.  On the **Receive Locations** page, do the following:  
  
    1.  Click **New**.  
  
    2.  In the **Receive Locations** window, on the **General** page, type the **Name** of the receive location.  
  
    3.  From the **Type** drop-down list, select the transport type, and from the **Receive handler** drop-down list, select the transport address.  
  
    4.  From the **Receive pipeline** drop-down list, select the receive pipeline.  
  
    5.  On the **Schedule** page, select the **Start date** and the **End date** to restrict receiving documents.  
  
    6.  Select the **Enable service window** checkbox.  
  
    7.  Click **OK**.  
  
5.  On the **Inbound Maps** page, select the inbound maps for transforming documents on the selected port.  
  
6.  On the **Tracking** page, select the desired tracking message bodies and tracking message properties.  
  
7.  Click **OK**.  

## Set the receive port transport properties
For a TIBCO Enterprise Message System (EMS) receive location, the **URL** and **Target Namespace** to the TIBCO EMS System are the only configuration values required.    
 
1.  Expand the **System Definition** and enter all required information for connection to the TIBCO EMS server.  
  
2.  Expand **Message Handling** and enter all required information.  
  
    |Parameter|Description|  
    |---------------|-----------------|  
    |**Message Selector**|Messages are received only if this string evaluates to True with the message in the destination.<br /><br /> Allows the receive port to retrieve only messages that contain header properties that match the expression described in this field.<br /><br /> The syntax of message selectors is based on a subset of the SQL92 conditional expression syntax. The syntax is fully described in the TIBCO EMS users guide.<br /><br /> For example, if a message contains a header property name NewsType, a receive port can retrieve only those that are of type Sports or Editorial.|  
    |**Retry Count**|The retry count for the transport. Default value is 0.|  
    |**Retry Interval**|The period of time the adapter waits before initiating a retry. Default value is five minutes.|  
  
3.  Expand the **Server Connection Definition** and enter all required information.  
  
    |Parameter|Description|  
    |---------------|-----------------|  
    |**Destination**|Mandatory setting. Defines the name and type of the destination. Defines the queue or topic with the following format: Queue[queue.name] or Topic[topic.name].|  
    |**Port Number**|Port on which the TIBCO EMS server listens.|  
    |**Server Name**|Mandatory setting. Name of the system hosting the TIBCO EMS server.|  
  
4.  Provide credentials using Single Sign-On (SSO).  
  
     There are two methods that you can use to access the TIBCO EMS system. You can use Credentials (user name and password parameters) or Single Sign-On.  
  
    -   Select **Yes** in **Use SSO** to use Single Sign-On.  
  
    -   Select an affiliate application in the list.  
  
         An affiliate application, created by Enterprise Single Sign-On tools, represents an application such as TIBCO EMS. Microsoft BizTalk Adapter for TIBCO EMS uses the credentials of an application user. These credentials are retrieved from the SSO database for the server system for a specified affiliate application.  
  
         For more information about how to create an affiliate application, see [Creating Affiliate Applications](../core/creating-affiliate-applications5.md).  
  
5.  Expand **User Credentials** and enter the **User Name** and **Password** to access the TIBCO EMS server.  
  
    |Parameter|Description|  
    |---------------|-----------------|  
    |`Password`|The userâ€™s password that is used to communicate with a TIBCO EMS daemon.<br /><br /> If you did not select **Use SSO**, you must set credential parameters for BizTalk Adapter for TIBCO EMS to communicate with a TIBCO EMS daemon.|  
    |`User Name`|Name of a user that is used to communicate with a TIBCO EMS daemon.<br /><br /> If you did not select **Use SSO**, you must set credential parameters for BizTalk Adapter for TIBCO EMS to communicate with a TIBCO EMS daemon.|  
  
6.  Click **Apply**, and then click **OK**.
