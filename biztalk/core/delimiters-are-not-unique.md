## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that the EDI send pipeline could not process an outgoing interchange because two or more of the separators identified in the interchange, and used to separate facets of the interchange, were the same. The separators are identified in the ISA segment of an X12 interchange and in the UNA segment of an EDIFACT interchange. Two or more separators with the same value can occur in a preserved batch scenario, or if an interchange is received via a passthrough transmit and then picked up by the send port as an XML file in the MessageBox. This error condition will cause processing of the interchange to fail.  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, identify which separators in the interchange have the same value, and change the value of one of the separators.
