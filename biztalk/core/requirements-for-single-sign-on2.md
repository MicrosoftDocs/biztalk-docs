# Requirements for Single Sign-On
To use Single Sign-On (SSO), you need:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)]  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../includes/vs2010-md.md)]  
  
-   Enterprise Single Sign-On  
  
-   A Server System that supports SSO  
  
 The isolated host should be configured as authentication trusted.  
  
### To enable SSO  
  
1.  In the **Transport Properties** window, select **Yes** for **Use SSO**.  
  
2.  Select an appropriate affiliate application when specifying transport properties.  
  
 For information about how to create an affiliate application, see [Creating Affiliate Applications](../core/creating-affiliate-applications2.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  After performing work using SSO, remember to reset any Web-Sharing folder to **Do not share**. Applications that use that folder will not update or uninstall correctly if the folder is shared because it is considered to be in use.
