# BAM Interceptors in a High Availability Environment
This topic describes the failover processes for the BAM WF interceptor and the BAM WCF interceptor in a high availability environment during a SQL Server failover.

## BAM WF Interceptor
 When operating in a high availability environment, the BAM WF interceptor will retry retrieval of the interceptor configuration file when there is a SQL Server connection problem during a SQL Server failover. However, the interceptor will not retry when writing data to the BAM Primary Import database when a SQL Server failover is in process. This is because the interceptor relies on the behavior of the **WorkflowCommitBatchService** class when writing data to the BAM Primary Import database.

 In the following example, **DefaultWorkflowCommitWorkBatchService** is added as a run-time service with enableRetries="true" so that it retries the batch as shown in a snippet from an App.config file:

```
<add type="System.Workflow.Runtime.Hosting.DefaultWorkflowCommitWorkBatchService, System.Workflow.Runtime, Version=3.0.00000.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35"  enableRetries="True"/>
```

 However, if there are existing ambient transactions when the **CommitWorkBatch** method is called, the workflow instance is terminated immediately when a SQL Server connection is not available.

 For more information about the behavior of the **WorkflowCommitBatchService** class in a high availability environment, see the "Reliability and High Availability" section in "Introduction to Hosting Windows Workflow Foundation" at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=88068](/previous-versions/dotnet/articles/aa663362(v=msdn.10)).

## BAM WCF Interceptor
 In a high availability environment, the BAM WCF interceptor does not retry retrieval of the interceptor configuration file when there is a SQL Server connection problem during a SQL Server failover. You should therefore customize the WCF code to compensate for failure or use reliable messaging to resubmit messages.
