# Consuming Web Services
Consuming Web services enables you to add existing Web services to your business process. You can aggregate several Web services into a single orchestration.  
  
 You can consume (call) a Web service from your orchestration by using Web ports. To consume a Web service from an orchestration, you create a Web port and construct Web messages.  
  
 You can use SOAP headers with the consumed Web service, change the URI of a consumed Web service, and dynamically set the URI for a consumed Web service.  
  
 For information about configuring a SOAP receive handler, see [How to Configure a SOAP Receive Handler](../core/how-to-configure-a-soap-receive-handler.md). For information about configuring a SOAP receive location, see [How to Configure a SOAP Receive Location](../core/how-to-configure-a-soap-receive-location.md).
