# How to Use the Role Link Shape
A **Role Link** shape contains placeholders for an implements role or provider role and a uses role or consumer role. It can include one of either, or one of each.  
  
 You can add port types directly to a **Role Link** shape, using either existing roles or new roles, and existing or new port types.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  We recommend that you create the role link type and associated port type prior to create the role link so that you can use an existing role link type for defining your role link. For more information, see [How to Create Role Links in Orchestrations](../core/how-to-create-role-links-in-orchestrations.md).  
  
### To add a Role Link  
  
-   Right-click a Port Surface and then click **New Role Link**.  
  
     —Or—  
  
     From the **BizTalk Orchestrations** tab of the Toolbox, drag the **Role Link** shape onto a Port Surface.  
  
### To remove a Role Link  
  
-   Right-click the **Role Link** to remove, and then click **Delete**.
