## Explanation  
 This Error/Warning/Information event indicates that the EDI receive pipeline could not process an incoming transaction set because the receive pipeline could not find the ST or UNH header.  
  
## User Action  
 To resolve this error, contact the sender of the interchange, and have them ensure that the transaction set in error begins with an ST01 or UNH1 segment.
