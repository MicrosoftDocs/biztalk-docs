# Error - Too Many Logical Inputs to Node
**Error Code**  
  
 btm1006  
  
 **Explanation**  
  
 There are a greater number of logical links connected to the indicated node in the destination schema than the number of input links to the **Looping** functoid that is connected to an ancestor node of the indicated node. The number of links of the former and latter types should match.  
  
 **User Action**  
  
 Rework the number of links connected to the indicated node and to the **Looping** functoid connected to the ancestor node so that they match.
