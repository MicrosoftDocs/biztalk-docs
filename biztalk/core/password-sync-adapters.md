# Password Sync Adapters
A *password sync adapter* is a component that propagates password changes to and from a non-Windows system. Although password sync adapters are similar to traditional Single Sign-On applications, they have several differences:  
  
-   They are administered using a specialized interface.  
  
-   They are described using a specialized XML format in the configuration store.  
  
-   Host Integration Server uses a specialized feature to organize adapters in the configuration store.
