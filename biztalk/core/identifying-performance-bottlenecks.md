# Identifying Performance Bottlenecks
Ideally, when a system is running at almost full capacity (optimal utilization of available resources), sustainable throughput can be achieved, lowering total cost of ownership (TCO).  
  
 When the system does not perform as expected, it is essential to identify the source of the problem. These topics explain how to identify and resolve the performance bottlenecks.
