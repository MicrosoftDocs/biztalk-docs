# PartnerManagement (BizTalk Server Sample)
The PartnerManagement sample demonstrates how to manage parties in the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] environment by using the **ExplorerOM** administration objects.  
  
## Prerequisites  
  
-   You must have [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] administrative privileges to use the administrative objects in this sample.  
  
-   The Windows PowerShell script requires the Windows PowerShell execution policy to allow script execution. For more information see [Examining the Execution Policy](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=128930).  
  
## What This Sample Does  
 This sample demonstrates using the administrative classes from the **Microsoft.BizTalk.ExplorerOM** namespace to manage parties. Parties represent trading partners or back-end applications with which a business process can interact. For more information about parties in general, see the documentation for [Parties](../core/parties.md) or [Role Links and Service Link Roles](../core/role-links-and-service-link-roles.md). The sample is written in Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsVCSharp](../includes/btsvcsharp-md.md)]. A Windows PowerShell example script is also included in this topic. The sample demonstrates the following operations:  
  
-   Creating a new party with a custom or standard alias and adding existing [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] send ports to the party.  
  
-   Enlisting the new party with an existing role link on the BizTalk server.  
  
-   Un-enlisting the new party.  
  
-   Deleting the new party.  
  
## Where To Find This Sample  
 The sample is located in the following SDK location:  
  
 \<*Samples Path*\>\Admin\ExplorerOM\PartnerManagement  
  
 The following table shows the files in this sample and describes their purpose.  
  
|File(s)|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|PartnerManagement.cs|[!INCLUDE[btsVCSharp](../includes/btsvcsharp-md.md)] source file for operations demonstrated in this sample.|  
|PartnerManagement.sln and PartnerManagement.csproj|Solution and project files for the sample.|  
  
## Building and Running This Sample  
 Before you build the sample, you need to make four code modifications to customize the sample for the BizTalk server. This is necessary because the sample uses arbitrary names for send ports associated with the party and an arbitrary role name for the enlistment. Therefore you need to provide valid names to the sample. To demonstrate this sample, this topic describes first building the PartyResolution sample from the following directory: \<*Samples Path*\>\Orchestrations\PartyResolution. This approach is used to make sure a valid role name and send port names are present on the BizTalk server to demonstrate the sample procedures.  
  
#### To build this sample  
  
1.  First make sure the PartyResolution sample has been built and initialized so that a valid role name and send port names can be used by the sample. This is documented in the section entitled “Building and Initializing This Sample” in  [PartyResolution (BizTalk Server Sample)](../core/partyresolution-biztalk-server-sample.md).  
  
2.  In [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)], open the solution file PartnerManagement.sln.  
  
3.  In Solution Explorer, open the source file PartnerManagement.cs.  
  
4.  Scroll down into the function named **CreateParty** and insert the two send port names from the PartyResolution sample or use valid names from the BizTalk server environment. The following code example demonstrates the change using the send ports from the PartyResolution sample.  
  
    ```  
    // Replacing arbitrary send port names with PartyResolution send port names ===  
  
    //            myParty.SendPorts.Add(catalog.SendPorts["NormalDelivery"]);  
    //            myParty.SendPorts.Add(catalog.SendPorts["ExpressDelivery"]);  
                myParty.SendPorts.Add(catalog.SendPorts["SP_FilesToShipmentAgency1"]);  
                myParty.SendPorts.Add(catalog.SendPorts["SP_FilesToShipmentAgency2"]);  
  
    ```  
  
5.  Scroll down into the function named **EnlistParty** and change the foreach loop so that it searches the Supplier assembly for a role named “ShipmentRole” to use with the enlistment. The following code example demonstrates the change to use the ShipmentRole from the PartyResolution sample.  
  
    ```  
                // Search for the “Shipmentrole” instead of “shipperRole”  
                Role svcRole = null;  
    //===       foreach (Role role in catalog.Assemblies[0].Roles)  
                foreach (Role role in catalog.Assemblies["Supplier"].Roles)  
                {  
    //===          if (role.Name == "ShipperRole")  
                   if (role.Name == "ShipmentRole")  
                   {  
                      svcRole = role;  
                      break;  
                   }  
                }  
  
    ```  
  
6.  Scroll down into the function named **UnenlistParty** and change the foreach loop to search the Supplier assembly for the ShipmentRole. The following code example demonstrates this change.  
  
    ```  
                // Search for the “ShipmentRole” instead of “shipperRole”  
                Role svcRole = null;  
    //===       foreach (Role role in catalog.Assemblies[0].Roles)  
                foreach (Role role in catalog.Assemblies["Supplier"].Roles)  
                {  
    //===          if (role.Name == "ShipperRole")  
                   if (role.Name == "ShipmentRole")  
                   {  
                      svcRole = role;  
                      break;  
                   }  
                }  
  
    ```  
  
7.  After creating and enlisting the new party with the ShipmentRole, the sample is designed to immediately un-enlist the party and delete it. Add the following code change to the main procedure to pause execution and allow you to view the created enlistment for the new party in the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console.  
  
    ```  
    static void Main(string[] args)  
    {  
       CreateParty();     
       EnlistParty();     
  
       Console.WriteLine("\nNew Party created and enlisted.\n\nPress <Enter> to unenlist and delete.\n");  
       Console.ReadLine();  
  
       UnenlistParty();   
       DeleteParty();  
    }  
  
    ```  
  
8.  On the **Build** menu, click **Build Solution**.  
  
#### To run this sample  
  
1.  Open a command window and navigate to the following folder:  
  
     \<*Samples Path*\>\Admin\ExplorerOM\PartnerManagement\bin\Debug  
  
2.  Run the file PartnerManagement.exe.  
  
3.  When the sample displays the message that the new party is created and enlisted, open the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console and view the new party named **FedEx** under the **Parties** node.  
  
4.  In the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console, navigate the tree view to the **ShipmentRole** under **Applications\BizTalk Application 1\Role Links**. Double-click **ShipmentRole** and notice **ShipmentAgency1** mapped to the **SupplierAdvice** operation and **ShipmentAgency2** mapped to the **SupplierOrder** operation in the enlistment.  
  
5.  In the command window, press ENTER to allow the sample to un-enlist and delete the new party.  
  
6.  In the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console, verify the party was un-enlisted from the **ShipmentRole** and deleted from the **Parties** node.
