# EDIFACT CONTRL Message as Functional Acknowledgment
If you have selected to generate a functional acknowledgment in business profile settings or trading partner agreement (or fallback agreement if no agreement is defined between the two business profiles), or if the UNB9 field in the message is set to "1", a CONTRL message will be generated as a functional acknowledgment (ACK). This ACK reports the results of syntax checks of the interchange.  
  
 The CONTRL functional ACK includes the following segments:  
  
- UNH message header (mandatory)  
  
- A UCI segment that identifies the subject interchange and indicates the status interchange receipt, and contains references to the UNA, UNB, and UNZ segments of the received interchange (mandatory). The UCI segment has a max occurrence of 1; as a result, it reports the first error encountered in one of the control segments.  
  
- A UCF segment that identifies a group segment (encapsulated by the UNG header and UNE trailer) and indicates the nature of any error (mandatory if the UNG segment exists)  
  
- A UCM segment that identifies a message segment (encapsulated by the UNH header and UNT trailer) and indicates the nature of any error (mandatory)  
  
- A UCS segment that identifies a transaction set and indicates the nature of any error (mandatory)  
  
- A UCD segment that identifies an erroneous composite or component data element and indicates the nature of the error (conditional)  
  
- UNT message trailer (mandatory).  
  
  If a received CONTRL functional acknowledgment only contains UNH, UCI, and UNT segments, the EDIReceive pipeline will process the acknowledgment as a CONTRL receipt (technical) acknowledgment.  
  
  Each instance of a segment at a reporting level (i.e., the UCI, UCF, UCM, UCS, and UCD segments) can report only one error.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The CONTRL message contains several mandatory data elements that will be copied from the received interchange. If the data element in the interchange is missing or is syntactically invalid, a syntactically valid CONTRL message cannot be generated. The error must then be reported by some means other than a CONTRL message.  
> 
> [!NOTE]
>  In BizTalk Server, a CONTRL message (receipt acknowledgment, acceptance, or rejection) is sent in response to a received interchange that contains only one or more CONTRL messages. In [!INCLUDE[bts2010R2](../includes/bts2010r2-md.md)], no CONTRL message (receipt acknowledgment, acceptance, or rejection) is sent in response to a received interchange that contains only one or more CONTRL messages. Errors in received CONTRL messages must be reported by a means other than a CONTRL message. If one or more CONTRL messages are contained in an interchange that contains data messages, the CONTRL message generated as a response to that interchange will be generated as if no CONTRL messages were contained in the received interchange.  
  
 **SG Loops**  
  
 The CONTRL functional ACK will be structured differently depending upon whether the received interchange includes one or more groups. If the interchange includes a group, the ACK will contain one UCF segment per group. Each UCF segment will contain one UCM segment per message, and each UCM segment will include a series of UCS and UCD segments in tandem.  
  
 The XML form of the ACK message will include an SG3Loop element that encapsulates each UCF segment, an SG4Loop element that encapsulates each UCM element, and an SG5Loop element that encapsulates each pair of UCS and UCD elements. SG loop tags are not present in the native EDI format of the message.  
  
 If the interchange does not include a group, the ACK will not contain any UCF segments. Instead it will include one UCM segment per message, and each UCM segment will include a series of UCS and UCD segments in tandem.  
  
 The XML form of the ACK message will include an SG1Loop element that encapsulates each UCM element, and an SG2Loop element that encapsulates each pair of UCS and UCD elements. As with interchanges that include groups, the SG tags are not present in the native format of the ACK.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  By default and industry usage, SG1/SG4 loops are not expected for accepted transaction sets. However, to support compliance with standards, you can force generation of SG1/SG4 by selecting the **Generate SG1/SG4 loop for accepted transaction sets** checkbox in the **Acknowledgements** page of the Agreement Properties dialog box for an agreement between two business profiles (or the **Acknowledgements** page of the EDI Settings tab for a business profile). If this checkbox is selected, the receive pipeline will generate SG1/SG4 loops whether the transaction set is accepted or rejected. Otherwise, these loops will be generated only for erroneous transaction sets (for which UCM5 != 7).
