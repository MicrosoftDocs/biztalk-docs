# Configuring Fallback Validation Properties (X12)
X12 interchange validation generation fallback settings define how [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] checks for duplicate control numbers in the received interchange.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The settings described here also apply to HIPAA interchange validation.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 You must be logged on as a member of the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administrators or [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] B2B Operators group.  
  
### To configure validation  
  
1. In the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration Console, right-click the **Parties** node, and then click **X12 Fallback Settings**.  
  
2. In the **X12 Fallback Settings** dialog box, in the **X12 Agreement Pages** tab, under the **Interchange Settings** section, click **Validation**.  
  
3. Select the **Interchange Control Number** check box to enable the receive pipeline to block duplicate interchanges. If selected, [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] will check that the interchange control number (ISA13) for the received interchange does not match the interchange control number. If a match is detected, the receive pipeline will not process the interchange.  
  
4. If **Interchange Control Number** is selected, in the **Check for duplicate ISA13 within** field, enter the number of days that a check for a duplicate interchange will be performed using a specific interchange control number.  
  
5. Select **Group Control Number** to prevent the receive pipeline from processing interchanges with duplicate group control numbers (GS6).  
  
6. Select **Transaction Set Control Number** to prevent the receive pipeline from processing interchanges with duplicate transaction set control numbers (ST2).  
  
7. Click **Apply** to accept the changes before continuing with the configuration, or click **OK** to validate the changes and then close the dialog box.
