# Deploying Ports and Assemblies
Using [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], you can duplicate ports and assemblies on a target computer. BizTalk Server exports the send ports/receive location configuration into an XML file.  
  
 You can use BizTalk Server to do the following tasks:  
  
-   Deploy or remove BizTalk Server assemblies in a BizTalk Configuration database  
  
-   Install or uninstall the assemblies in the global assembly cache (GAC)  
  
-   Import or export BizTalk Server assembly binding information to and from binding files  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The Microsoft BizTalk Adapter for JD Edwards OneWorld only requires that you have Visual Studio on a source (development) computer. Visual Studio is not required on the production computer.
