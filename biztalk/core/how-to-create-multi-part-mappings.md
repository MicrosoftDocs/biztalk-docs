# How to Create Multi-Part Mappings
If you have multiple maps that are used together, you will need to combine them in an orchestration to test them together. The **Test Map** command works on only one map at a time.  
  
 For more information about designing and using orchestrations, see [Creating Orchestrations Using Orchestration Designer](../core/creating-orchestrations-using-orchestration-designer.md).
