# SendMail
The SendMail sample demonstrates how you can use the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) adapter to send e-mail messages from within a Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] orchestration. Dynamic information used to send the e-mail messages is retrieved from an XML message using property promotion functionality.  
  
## What This Sample Does  
 This sample sends an e-mail message using information obtained from properties promoted out of an incoming XML purchase order (PO) message, using the following sequence of steps:  
  
1.  The [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] orchestration retrieves an input XML PO message.  
  
2.  The [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] orchestration promotes the **PONumber** and **Email** properties for easier access in the future.  
  
3.  The [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] orchestration uses the values of the promoted properties to set the destination address of the dynamic send port and to set the subject of the e-mail message.  
  
4.  The [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] orchestration sends the constructed e-mail message through the SMTP adapter.  
  
## Where to Find This Sample  
 \<*Samples Path*\>\AdaptersUsage\SendMail\  
  
 The following table shows the files in this sample and describes their purpose.  
  
|File(s)|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|AssemblyInfo.cs, SendMail.btproj, SendMail.sln|Provides project, solution, and assembly information files for this sample.|  
|Cleanup.bat|Undeploys assemblies and removes them from the global assembly cache (GAC); removes send and receive ports; removes Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) virtual directories as needed.|  
|PropertySchema.xsd, PurchaseOrder.xsd|Provides schemas for the properties that you want to promote, and for the XML PO message, respectively.|  
|ReceiveSend.odx|Provides a [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] orchestration that processes the incoming XML PO message and sends an e-mail message based on information in the message.|  
|SendMailInput.xml|Contains a sample input file with a PO specified using XML.|  
|Setup.bat|Builds and initializes this sample. **Note:**  This setup file creates and binds ports, and so on, using a different mechanism than most of the setup files for the SDK samples. It does not require a companion .xml file.|  
  
### To build and initialize this sample  
  
1.  In a command window, navigate to the following folder:  
  
     \<*Samples Path*\>\AdaptersUsage\SendMail  
  
2.  Run the file Setup.bat, which performs the following actions:  
  
    -   Creates the following input folder for this sample:  
  
         \<*Samples Path*\>\AdaptersUsage\SendMail\In  
  
    -   Compiles the [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] project for this sample.  
  
    -   Starts the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] orchestration.  
  
        > [!NOTE]
        >  You should confirm that BizTalk did not report any errors during the build and initialization process before attempting to run this sample.  
  
        > [!NOTE]
        >  If you choose to open and build the project in this sample without running the file Setup.bat, you must first create a strong name key pair using the .NET Framework Strong Name Utility (sn.exe). Use this key pair to sign the resulting assembly.  
  
        > [!NOTE]
        >  To undo changes made by Setup.bat, run Cleanup.bat and delete all receive and send ports prefixed with SendMail_1.0.0.0_Microsoft.Samples.BizTalk.SendMail. You must run Cleanup.bat before running Setup.bat a second time.  
  
3.  In the **BizTalk Server Administration** console, locate the receive port prefixed by SendMail_1.0.0.0_Microsoft.Samples.BizTalk.SendMail. Update the receive location for this receive port to point to a directory on your file system to use as the input location.  
  
4.  Using a program such as Notepad, modify the file SendMailInput.xml so that the **Email** element specifies a legitimate e-mail address at which you want to receive the e-mail message generated by this sample.  
  
5.  Click **Start**, point to **Programs**, point to [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerStartMenuItemui](../includes/btsbiztalkserverstartmenuitemui-md.md)], and then click **BizTalk Server Administration**.  
  
6.  In the **BizTalk Server Administration** console, expand the BizTalk Group tree.  
  
7.  Expand the **Platform Settings** tree in the left pane.  
  
8.  Expand the **Adapters** folder, click the **SMTP** node, and then double-click the SMTP adapter row in the right pane.  
  
9. In the **SMTP - Adapter Handler Properties** dialog box, click **Properties**.  
  
10. In the **SMTP Transport Properties** dialog box, on the **Properties** tab, provide appropriate values for the **SMTP server name** and **From (e-mail address)** properties, and then click **OK**.  
  
     These values will be used to construct the From e-mail address for any e-mail messages sent through this SMTP adapter.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If you need to authenticate with your SMTP server, you must ensure that the From e-mail address belongs to the same account that you use for authentication.  
  
11. Stop and then restart the BizTalk service (BizTalkServerApplication) so that the orchestration will adopt these changes.  
  
### To run this sample  
  
1.  Put a copy of the modified file SendMailInput.xml into the input folder.  
  
2.  Observe the arrival of an e-mail message to the e-mail address you specified in the previous procedure.
