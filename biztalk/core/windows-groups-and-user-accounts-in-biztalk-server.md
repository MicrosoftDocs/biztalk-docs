# Windows Groups and User Accounts in BizTalk Server

Information about BizTalk Server local and domain group and user accounts. The Configuration Manager creates the necessary BizTalk group accounts for you by default if you install BizTalk Server and all prerequisite software on a single computer. The information contained in this section applies to multiple computer topologies.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  BizTalk Server supports local group and user accounts only in single computer configurations. BizTalk Server supports domain group and user accounts in both single and multiple computer configurations. If you use domain groups for your BizTalk Server configuration, you must manually create the groups before you configure BizTalk Server. The Configuration Manager cannot create domain groups.  

## Prerequisites

Have permissions to use **Active Directory Users and Computers**, and create domain groups. In most organizations, this task is done by domain administrators, not the BizTalk Server administrators.

## Create groups and user accounts

1. Open **Active Directory Users and Computers**.
2. Create the groups. For the specific steps to create on-premises groups, see [Create a Group Account in Active Directory](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/create-a-group-account-in-active-directory).
