# Error - Could Generate Multiple Equivalent Children
**Error Code**  
  
 btm1026  
  
 **Explanation**  
  
 Links to the destination schema inappropriately enable multiple nodes within an **Equivalent** group node to be generated.  
  
 **User Action**  
  
 Rework the links into the destination schema, potentially using logical functoids, so that only a single node within the **Equivalent** group node can be generated during mapping.
