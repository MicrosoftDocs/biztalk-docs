# Troubleshooting BizTalk Server Migration
This section provides a centralized location for information about common problems encountered while migrating BizTalk applications from [!INCLUDE[btsbiztalkserver2006r2](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r2-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] 2009 to [!INCLUDE[prague](../includes/prague-md.md)].  
  
## Known Issues  
  
#### Custom applications might not work while upgrading  
  
##### Problem  
 While upgrading from [!INCLUDE[btsbiztalkserver2006r2](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r2-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] 2009 to [!INCLUDE[prague](../includes/prague-md.md)], some custom applications might not work.  
  
##### Cause  
 All the BizTalk managed code components run on CLR 4.0. As these components are compiled against [!INCLUDE[netfx40_short](../includes/netfx40-short-md.md)], they need a config file to run in CLR 4.0.  
  
##### Solution  
 To resolve this issue, update the config file.  
  
```  
<configuration>  
<startup useLegacyV2RuntimeActivationPolicy="true">  
<supportedRuntime version="v4.0" />  
</startup>  
</configuration>  
```
