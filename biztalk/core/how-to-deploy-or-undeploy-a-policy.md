# How to Deploy or Undeploy a Policy
This topic describes how to use the BizTalk Server Administration console to deploy or undeploy a policy manually. In addition, starting an application automatically deploys any policies it contains, and stopping an application automatically undeploys its policies. Deploying a policy puts it into effect in the application that uses it. Undeploying a policy makes it inactive so that it no longer functions in any application that uses it in the BizTalk group.  
  
 When deploying or undeploying a policy, bear in mind the following important points:  
  
-   Before you can deploy a policy, it must exist in the Rule Engine database for the BizTalk group. If you import an application that contains a policy, the policy is automatically imported into the Rule Engine database, or you can explicitly import a policy into the Rule Engine database by using the administration console or BTSTask, as described in [How to Import a Policy](../core/how-to-import-a-policy.md). Alternatively, you can add a policy to the Rule Engine database by using the Rule Engine Deployment Wizard, as described in [How to Deploy and Undeploy Policies and Vocabularies](../core/how-to-deploy-and-undeploy-policies-and-vocabularies.md).  
  
-   Before you can deploy a policy, it must be published, as described in [How to Publish a Policy](../core/how-to-publish-a-policy.md).  
  
-   A deployed policy cannot be modified. If you want to modify a deployed policy, you must first undeploy it.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform the procedure in this topic, you must be logged on with an account that is a member of the BizTalk Server Administrators group. For more detailed information on permissions, see [Permissions Required for Deploying and Managing a BizTalk Application](../core/permissions-required-for-deploying-and-managing-a-biztalk-application.md).  
  
### To deploy or undeploy a policy  
  
1.  Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerStartMenuItemui](../includes/btsbiztalkserverstartmenuitemui-md.md)], and then click **BizTalk Server Administration**.  
  
2.  In the console tree, expand **BizTalk Server Administration**, expand the BizTalk group containing the policy that you want to deploy or undeploy, and then expand **\<All Artifacts\>**.  
  
3.  Click **Policies**, right-click the policy, and then click **Deploy** or **Undeploy**.
