# Configuring EDI Batches
The topics in this section describe how to receive a split or preserved batched interchange, how to send a preserved interchange over an XML pipeline, and how to implement an external batch release mechanism.  
  
 The topics in this section do not contain information on how to send interchanges in batches. For more information on how to batch outgoing interchanges, see [Configuring Batching (X12)](../core/configuring-batching-x12.md) (for X12 encoded messages) or [Configuring Batching (EDIFACT)](../core/configuring-batching-edifact.md) (for EDIFACT encoded messages).
