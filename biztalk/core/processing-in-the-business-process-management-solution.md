# Processing in the Business Process Management Solution
This section describes how the Business Process Management Solution works: how it processes orders, how it makes use of interrupts, and how it handles exceptions so that actions can be retried.  
  
 Order processing relies on two main orchestrations, **OrderBroker** and **OrderManager**. The **OrderBroker** orchestration is written so that there can be multiple order manager orchestrations, one for each kind of order. The solution includes only one **OrderManager**. It, too, is relatively generic so that it can be adapted to other types of orders.
