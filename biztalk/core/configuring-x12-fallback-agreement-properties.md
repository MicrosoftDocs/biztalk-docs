# Configuring X12 Fallback Agreement Properties
The properties described in this section apply whenever X12-encoded interchanges (including HIPAA) are exchanged and [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] cannot determine the agreement that the interchanges (inbound or outbound) resolve to. This section also describes general fallback settings common to both X12 and EDIFACT encoded messages.
