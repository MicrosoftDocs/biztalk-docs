# How to Delete Functoids
When developing maps, you will sometimes need to delete an existing functoid. Deleting a functoid also deletes the associated input and output links, as well as any additional input parameters, script specification, and table grid configuration.  
  
### To delete an existing functoid  
  
1.  Display the grid page that contains the functoid you want to delete. For more information about working with grid pages, including switching between grid pages, see [Working with Grid Pages](../core/working-with-grid-pages.md).  
  
2.  Select the functoid you want to delete by clicking on it.  
  
     You can select multiple functoids and then delete them at a time. For more information about bulk-selecting the functoids and links, see [How to Select Multiple Links and Functoids](../core/how-to-select-multiple-links-and-functoids.md).  
  
3.  On the **Edit** menu, click **Delete**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  You can also press the DELETE key, or right-click the selected functoid in the relevant grid page and click **Delete** from the context menu.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  You cannot undo the functoid or link deletion. For more information on how to undo or redo user operations, see [How to Undo or Redo User Operations](../core/how-to-undo-or-redo-user-operations.md).
