# Getting started with BizTalk Server
[!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] is a [publish and subscribe architecture](../core/publish-and-subscribe-architecture.md) that [uses adapters](../core/using-adapters.md) to receive and send messages, implements [business processes through orchestration](../core/defining-business-processes.md), and includes [management and tracking](../core/management-and-tracking-architecture.md) of these different parts. [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] also includes [trading partner management](../core/trading-partner-management-using-biztalk-server.md) for business-to-business messaging, [high availability](../core/planning-for-high-availability3.md) to maximize uptime, a development platform to [create your own components](../core/developing-custom-components.md),  an administration console to [manage your artifacts](../core/operational-and-administrative-tasks-in-your-biztalk-environment.md), and business activity monitoring to manage [aggregations, alerts, and profiles](../core/using-business-activity-monitoring.md).

## Understanding BizTalk, runtime architecture, and TPM
If you're looking to get started with [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], including learning how it works, then here are some good resources:

* [Understanding BizTalk Server](../core/understanding-biztalk-server.md)
* [Runtime Architecture](../core/runtime-architecture.md)
* [Trading Partner Management](../core/trading-partner-management-using-biztalk-server.md)
* Numerous topics on the [TechNet Wiki](/archive/technet-wiki/53832.biztalk-server-2020)

## Install, configure, and tutorials
Read about what's new, install [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)], and step through some tutorials:

* [What's new, installation, configuration, and upgrade](../install-and-config-guides/biztalk-server-what-s-new-installation-configuration-and-upgrade.md)
* [BizTalk Server tutorials](../core/biztalk-server-tutorials.md)
* [Samples in the SDK](../core/samples-in-the-sdk.md)

## Architecting or planning
If you're starting to architect a solution or are in the planning phase, then the following topics may help:

* [Scenarios for business solutions](../core/scenarios-for-business-solutions.md)
