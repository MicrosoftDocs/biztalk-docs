# SSOM: SharePoint Services Adapter Web Service
Using the [!INCLUDE[btsSharePointSvcsNoVersion](../includes/btssharepointsvcsnoversion-md.md)] adapter, you can receive messages from [!INCLUDE[btsSharePointSvcsNoVersion](../includes/btssharepointsvcsnoversion-md.md)] and send messages to [!INCLUDE[btsSharePointSvcsNoVersion](../includes/btssharepointsvcsnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[btsSharePointSvcsNoVersion](../includes/btssharepointsvcsnoversion-md.md)] Web Service Adapter, which is deprecated, uses the [!INCLUDE[btsSharePointSvcsNoVersion](../includes/btssharepointsvcsnoversion-md.md)] Service Side Object Model (SSOM). The web service is installed on the [!INCLUDE[btsSharePointSvcsNoVersion](../includes/btssharepointsvcsnoversion-md.md)] computer, which can be on the same computer as [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] or a separate computer. It is recommended to install [!INCLUDE[btsSharePointSvcsNoVersion](../includes/btssharepointsvcsnoversion-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] on separate computers.  
  
 We recommend using the Client Side Object Model (CSOM) of the [!INCLUDE[btsSharePointSvcsNoVersion](../includes/btssharepointsvcsnoversion-md.md)] Adapter. See [CSOM: SharePoint Services Adapter](../core/csom-sharepoint-services-adapter.md) and [Appendix B: Install the Microsoft SharePoint Adapter](../install-and-config-guides/appendix-b-install-the-microsoft-sharepoint-adapter.md) for installation and configuration options.
