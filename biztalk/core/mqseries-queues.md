# MQSeries Queues
To send messages to MQSeries queues, you can specify a remote definition queue, an alias queue, a transmission queue, or a local queue in the Queue Manager.  
  
 For receiving messages from MQSeries Server, you can specify a transmission queue, an alias queue, or a local queue in the Queue Manager.  
  
 Typically, you use a remote queue definition for a send queue, and a transmission queue for receiving messages.  
  
 For information about the different MQSeries queues, see the IBM WebSphere MQ documentation.
