# Pipeline Templates
In addition to the default pipelines, [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] includes two pipeline templates: a receive pipeline template and a send pipeline template. From a BizTalk project in Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)], you can add a pipeline template to your project by using the **Add New Item** command on the **Project** menu. Each template has an associated policy file, which determines the pipeline's stages and indicates which pipeline components are allowed in the pipeline. While you cannot reorder the stages in a policy file, you can use Pipeline Designer to reorder the components within a stage.  
  
 A policy file specifies:  
  
-   The sequence of stages.  
  
-   The number of components allowed per stage.  
  
-   The execution mode of each stage.  
  
 The policy files for the pipeline templates are stored in *\<BizTalk Server installation directory\>*\Developer Tools\Pipeline Policy Files. Do not modify the policy files. To make changes to a pipeline, open the pipeline template and use Pipeline Designer to modify it. For more information about using Pipeline Designer, see [Using Pipeline Designer](../core/using-pipeline-designer.md).  
  
 The empty pipeline template files are stored in *\<BizTalk Server installation directory\>*\Developer Tools\BizTalkProjectItems, and are named BTSReceivePipeline.btp and BTSTransmitPipeline.btp. The file name extension .btp indicates that the file is a BizTalk Server pipeline and can be edited in Pipeline Designer.
