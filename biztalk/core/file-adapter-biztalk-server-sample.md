# File Adapter (BizTalk Server Sample)
The File Adapter sample is written in Microsoft Visual C# .NET to work with Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)]. It provides code to build either a dynamic or a static adapter.  However, the following procedure only outlines the static adapter. A static adapter is an adapter with a static set of schemas and no custom user interface. A dynamic adapter has a custom user interface and potentially a dynamic set of schemas. Both static and dynamic adapters use the Add Adapter Wizard to add their schemas to a BizTalk project.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The File adapter sample is not the same as the native FILE adapter that ships with [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)]. Thus when selecting the transport type in using this sample select "static" instead of FILE.  
  
 The dynamic adapter with a custom user interface and potentially dynamic set of schemas will require additional code in the adapter management side. To better understand use of the dynamic set of schemas, see [Dynamic Design-Time Adapter Configuration](../core/dynamic-design-time-adapter-configuration.md).  
  
## What This Sample Does  
 The sample adapter copies files from a file folder, submits to BizTalk as messages, or takes messages from [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] and drops to a file folder. It provides code to build either a dynamic or a static adapter; however, the following procedure only outlines the static adapter. A static adapter is an adapter with a static set of schemas and no custom user interface. A dynamic adapter has a custom user interface and potentially a dynamic set of schemas. Both static and dynamic adapters use the Add Adapter Wizard to add their schemas to a BizTalk project.  
  
 You can use the sample file adapter as a template on which to create other custom adapters.

## How to Use This Sample  
 Use the sample file adapter as a template on which to create other custom adapters.  
  
## Building This Sample  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  If the BizTalk installation is 64-bit or the location of installation is modified, OutboundAssemblyPath, InboundAssemblyPath, AdapterMgmtAssemblyPath would need to be changed accordingly.  
  
 Use the following procedures to build and initialize the File Adapter sample.  
  
#### To create a strong name key for the DotNetFileAdapter projects and the Base Adapter project  
  
1.  Start **Visual Studio Command Prompt**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Run the command prompt as an Administrator.  
  
2.  Change the current directory to the \<*Samples Path*\>**\AdaptersDevelopment\BaseAdapter\v1.0.2** directory.  
  
3.  At the command prompt, type **sn –k BaseAdapter.snk** and then press ENTER. This .snk file may already exist as a result of other samples being run previously. If so, you can go right to step 4 and skip this step.  
  
4.  Change the current directory to the \<*Samples Path*\>\\**AdaptersDevelopment\File Adapter\Runtime** directory.  
  
5.  At the command prompt, type **sn –k DotNetFileAdapter.snk** and then press ENTER.  
  
6.  At the command prompt, type **exit** and then press ENTER to close the command prompt window.  
  
#### To build the receiver run-time project  
  
1.  Click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to **Accessories**, and then click **Windows Explorer**.
