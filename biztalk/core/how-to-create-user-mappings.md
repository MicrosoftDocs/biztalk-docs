# How to Create User Mappings
Use this command to create one or more user mappings, as specified in the XML file. The following is an example XML file.  
  
```  
<sso>  
<mapping>  
<windowsDomain>domain</windowsDomain>   
<windowsUserId>WindowsUserName</windowsUserId>   
<externalApplication>Application name1</externalApplication>   
<externalUserId>App1UserName</externalUserId>   
</mapping>  
<mapping>  
<windowsDomain>domain</windowsDomain>   
<windowsUserId>WindowsUserName</windowsUserId>   
<externalApplication>Application name2</externalApplication>   
<externalUserId>App2UserName</externalUserId>   
</mapping>  
</sso>  
  
```  
  
 If a user account is changed, you must use this command to create a mapping for the new user account. You should also remove the old user mapping. For more information about removing a mapping, see [How to Delete User Mappings](../core/how-to-delete-user-mappings.md).  
  
 After you create a user mapping, you must enable it before you can use this mapping in the SSO system. For more information, see [How to Enable a User Mapping](../core/how-to-enable-a-user-mapping.md).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Only domain groups are supported for user mappings.  
  
### To create user mappings using the administration utility

2.  At the command line, go to the Enterprise Single Sign-On installation directory. The default installation directory is \<*drive*\>:\Program Files\Common Files\Enterprise Single Sign-On.  
  
3.  Type **ssomanage –createmappings *\<mappings file name\>***, where *\<mappings file name\>* is the name of file that contains the user mapping(s) you want to create.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  On a system that supports User Account Control (UAC), you may need to run the tool with Administrative privileges.  
  
### To create user mappings using the client utility
