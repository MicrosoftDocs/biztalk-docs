|      activity window       |                                                                                                   Defines the time period over which activity instance data is visible. The data is always changing because the point in time is always changing. After the data passes through the activity window you can move it to the BAM Archive database by running the Data Maintenance DTS/SSIS package. After you move it to the BAM Archive database, it is no longer available for queries on the BAM portal.                                                                                                   |

Aggregations support the rapid and efficient querying of a multidimensional database.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|         agreement          | The defining item in relationship configuration. An agreement is based on the underlying business process and party management artifacts, and is defined between your self profile and your partner’s profile. It consists of one or more addendums. Addendums define the business process used, the role of your organization, your partner’s role, and the parameters used in the relationship. Agreements can also refer to partner group profiles instead of individual partner profiles. This facilitates the management of partners that have identical trading relationships with your organization. |

|          artifact          |                                   Most often referred to as a part of a BizTalk application, which is a logical unit for a BizTalk solution. Artifacts are managed and deployed through the BizTalk Administration console. Examples are orchestrations, pipelines, message schemas, security certificates, business rule policies, and bindings. Artifacts are also the parts of a BizTalk project, another logical unit for a BizTalk solution. In this context, the artifacts are used to generate the assemblies in Visual Studio that make up the BizTalk solution.                                    |

|condition|The "IF" part of a rule, used to specify what conditions should be evaluated, that is, represented using a single logical expression that evaluates to true or false. A condition is extensible to support user-defined conditions.|  
|configuration cache refresh Interval|The interval, in seconds,  in which changes to general properties for a BizTalk group, such as the SMTP host, are picked up.). This interval is set as part of group configuration. When you start BizTalk Server, all items in BizTalk Server Administration, such as MessageBox databases, server properties, adapters, and connections to the Tracking database, are stored in the administration cache. By default, all items in the cache are refreshed every 60 seconds, except for the server database connections and server properties.|  
|Configuration database server name|A UI element. The name of the server on which the Management, or configuration, database is housed.|

|correlation ID|A randomly generated ID that is associated with a message and passed along for the lifetime of a given message.|  
|correlation set|An instance of a correlation type; that is, the listed properties for a message that are used to determine whether it belongs to a given instance of an orchestration.|
