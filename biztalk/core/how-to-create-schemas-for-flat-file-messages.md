# Create Schemas for Flat File Messages

## Overview
After creating an XML message schema as described in [Creating Schemas for XML Messages](../core/how-to-create-schemas-for-xml-messages.md), use the **Schema Editor Extensions** property of the **Schema** node to enable the flat file extension. Enabling the flat file extension adds a considerable number of properties to many of the node types within a schema. These properties are generally used to control how a flat file business document is translated to and from its equivalent XML business document, and their values are stored as XML Schema definition language (XSD ) annotations within the schema file. Using these properties properly takes some practice and a thorough understanding of which aspects of the flat file format they each govern. 

For conceptual and reference information about the flat file properties, see [Considerations When Creating Flat File Message Schemas](../core/considerations-when-creating-flat-file-message-schemas.md) and **Supplemental Node Properties for Flat File Schemas** [!INCLUDE[ui-guidance-developers-reference](../includes/ui-guidance-developers-reference.md)].
