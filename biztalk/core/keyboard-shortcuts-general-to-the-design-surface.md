# Keyboard Shortcuts General to the Design Surface
The following table describes the keyboard navigation that is general to both the Process Area and Port Surfaces areas of the design surface.  
  
|Key|Effect|  
|---------|------------|  
|TAB|Selection and focus moves to the shape with inactive selection in the next design surface area on the right (that is, the Process Area or Port Surface).<br /><br /> Example: Selection and focus is currently on a port in the left Port Surface. When the TAB key is pressed, selection and focus move to the shape that had inactive focus in the Process Area.|  
|SHIFT + TAB|Same as TAB, but in the opposite direction.|  
|PAGE DOWN|Scrolls the page down so that later parts of the orchestration are shown. Selection and focus do not change.|  
|PAGE UP|Same as the PAGE DOWN key, but in the opposite direction. Selection and focus do not change.|  
|SHIFT + PAGE DOWN|Horizontally scrolls the entire design surface to the left by set increments. Selection and focus do not change.|  
|SHIFT + PAGE UP|Same as SHIFT + PAGE DOWN except that the design surface scrolls to the right. Selection and focus do not change.|  
|ENTER|Performs the default action for the selection, which usually means shifting focus to the Properties grid.|  
|SPACE|Selects the shape that currently has the focus. There is no effect if the focus is on a shape connector.|  
|CTRL + SHIFT + F1|Toggles between expansion and collapse of the Smart Tag of a selected shape. UP and DOWN ARROW can then be used to move through the items of a Smart Tag. When expanded, the Enter or Space keys execute the related action of a Smart Tag item (as well as collapsing the Smart Tag).|  
|DELETE|Deletes the current selection.|  
|CTRL + MWHEEL UP|Displays a zoomed out view of the design surface.|  
|CTRL + MWHEEL DOWN|Displays a zoomed in view of the design surface.|
