|  Message Text   | The secret could not be loaded from the registry. The service account for the SSO service may have been changed or the secret may be corrupted. Restore the secret from a backup file.%r<br /><br /> MSID: %1 |
  
## Explanation  
 It is likely that an administrator in the system has changed the SSO Service account, making decryption impossible.  
  
## User Action  
 Find the person who changed the SSO Service account, and then restore the secret from a backup file. For more information on restoring the secret, see [Managing the Master Secret](../core/managing-the-master-secret.md).
