# AddResource Command: Postprocessing Script
To add a postprocessing script to a BizTalk application, you use the **AddResource** command and specify **System.BizTalk:PostProcessingScript** for the Type parameter. Running this command adds the script file to the BizTalk Management database. The script file is also displayed in the BizTalk Administration console, in the Resources folder of the application to which you added it. In addition, the file is listed when you use the [ListApp Command](../core/listapp-command.md).  
  
 A postprocessing script runs from the .msi file after the application import or installation, or before uninstallation. You can also use BTSTask to add a preprocessing script, which runs before application import or installation, or after uninstallation, as described in [AddResource Command: Preprocessing Script](../core/addresource-command-preprocessing-script.md). For more information about preprocessing and postprocessing scripts, see [Using Pre- and Post-processing Scripts to Customize Application Deployment](../core/using-pre-and-post-processing-scripts-to-customize-application-deployment.md).

If the path includes spaces, you must enclose it in double quotation marks (").|
