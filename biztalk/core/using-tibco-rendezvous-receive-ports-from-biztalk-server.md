# Using TIBCO Rendezvous Receive Ports from BizTalk Server
To use a receive port, you can provide a schema to [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] for the incoming messages. A receive port is configured to listen for a particular set of subject names. It uses a subject name with optional wildcard characters to match multiple subject names. You define different port operations in the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] orchestration for each possible subject that matches the given string.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The Adapter supports both orchestration and messaging scenarios.  
  
## Defining Schemas  
 For example, if the port is configured to listen to the subject name, **STOCK.MARKET.INDICES.>** ('**>**' is a wildcard character that means anything else to the right), it would be valid to define operations for subject names such as **STOCK.MARKET.INDICES.NYSE.SP500**, **STOCK.MARKET.INDICES.TSX.TSX60**, and so on. The adapter generates messages using the strategy described in [Data Type Mapping for Receive Handlers in TIBCO Rendezvous](../core/data-type-mapping-for-receive-handlers-in-tibco-rendezvous.md), and generates the root element name and namespaces based on the listen subject name and received message subject names respectively.  
  
 In the previous example, the adapter generates a message that looks like this for the SP500 event:  
  
```  
<ns:STOCK.MARKET.INDICES.NYSE.SP500 xmlns:ns='   
http://schemas.microsoft.com/TibcoRendezvous/Types/  
STOCK.MARKET.INDICES.NYSE.GTWILDCARD'  
xmlns:tibrv=' http://schemas.microsoft.com/TibcoRendezvous/Types' â€¦ >  
<message body>  
</ns: STOCK.MARKET.INDICES.NYSE.SP500>  
  
```  
  
 You must define a schema that uses the same conventions. For example:  
  
```  
<xsd:schema  
targetNamespace='   
  
http://schemas.microsoft.com/TibcoRendezvous/Types/STOCK.MARKET.INDICES.N  
YSE.GTWILDCARD'  
xmlns:xsd=' http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema'  
xmlns:tibrv=' http://schemas.microsoft.com/TibcoRendezvous/Types'>  
xmlns:b="http://schemas.microsoft.com/BizTalk/2003"  
<xsd:element name='STOCK.MARKET.INDICES.NYSE.SP500'>  
  
 <xs:annotation>  
   <xs:appinfo>  
     <b:recordInfo rootTypeName="STOCK_MARKET_INDICES_NYSE_SP500" />  
   </xs:appinfo>  
  
 </xs:annotation>  
<xsd:complexType>  
<SP500 message definitions goes here>  
</xsd:complexType>  
<xsd:element name='STOCK.MARKET.INDICES.TSX.TSX60'>  
  
 <xs:annotation>  
   <xs:appinfo>  
     <b:recordInfo rootTypeName="STOCK_MARKET_INDICES_TSX_TSX60" />  
   </xs:appinfo>  
  
 </xs:annotation>  
<xsd:complexType>  
<TSX60 message definitions goes here>  
</xsd:complexType>  
  
```  
  
 Note the use of the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)]**recordInfo/rootTypeName** annotation. This is to instruct the [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)]/BizTalk integration to use that name for the generated .NET Framework types, instead of the name that contains dots. You can specify anything. In the examples, the dots are replaced with underscores.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The dots cause invalid names to be generated by the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] development tools.
