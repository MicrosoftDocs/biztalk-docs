# Configuring Certificates for AS2
To help secure AS2 data transfer using encryption and digital signatures, you must have the appropriate certificates installed, in addition to the appropriate AS2 configuration on [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)]. This topic describes the certificates required, how to configure them, and common issues with them.

## Prerequisites
 You must be logged on as a member of the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administrators group.

## Certificates Required for AS2 Transport
 To help secure AS2 data transfer, you must add the appropriate certificate to the appropriate certificate store, and associate the certificates with the appropriate BizTalk artifacts. The following certificates are used to help secure AS2 messages:


|        Certificate Usage         |          Certificate Type           | Pipeline Component |                              User Context                              |                                                                                           Certificate Store                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Where Defined                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Certificate Signing for Outgoing Messages
 Outgoing AS2 messages are signed using a default certificate defined as part of the BizTalk Group properties. However, there could be scenarios where the party receiving the messages wants the messages to be signed with a private certificate that they provide or expect a different certificate to be used when signing outgoing messages for them. This scenario of signing outgoing messages using other certificates is enabled if you select the **Override Group Signature Certificate** in the **Signature Certificate** page of the one-way agreement tab of the **Agreement Properties** dialog box, and specify a signing certificate. If a certificate is specified as part of the AS2 agreement for a party, that certificate is used for signing outgoing messages. If no certificate is defined for the party, the default certificate specified as part of the BizTalk Group properties is used.

## Adding Certificates to the Certificate Stores
 For more information, see the "Displaying the Certificates Management Console" section of [Installing Certificates for the WCF Adapters](../core/installing-certificates-for-the-wcf-adapters.md), as well as the [Certificate Wizard Utility](../core/certificate-wizard-utility.md) topic.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The Personal certificate store will be available for message processing only if the user profile is loaded for the user whose logon credentials are associated with the host instance. The Personal store is used for signing and decryption certificates (the user's own private key). The user profile is loaded by default for the in-process host instance; however, the user profile is not loaded by default for the isolated host instance. You can have an application load the user profile for the isolated host. Alternatively, you can work around this issue by using the same logon for the in-process host instance and the isolated host instance.

## Generating Certificates
 Certificates can be obtained from a Certificate Authority (CA); however the steps to request a certificate can vary between CAs. Review the information provided on the Certificate Authorityâ€™s Web site before submitting any certificate requests.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Certificates used for AS2 transport must have the attributes required for their intended use. For signing and signature verification, the **Key Usage** attribute of the certificate must be **Digital Signature**. For encryption and decryption, the **Key Usage** attribute of the certificate must be **Data Encipherment** or **Key Encipherment**. You can verify the **Key Usage** attribute by double-clicking the certificate, clicking the **Details** tab in the **Certificate** dialog box, and checking the **Key Usage** field.

 You can also generate certificates in Windows Server 2008 by using Certificate Services, however your partner may only accept these certificates for test purposes as they are self-signed instead of signed by a public CA. For more information on using Certificate Services to request certificates, download **Windows Server 2008 Active Directory Certificate Services Step-By-Step Guide** from [Windows Server 2008 Step-by-Step Guides](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=187916) ([https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=187916](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=187916)).

### To configure a certificate for signing outgoing AS2 messages

1. In the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console, right-click the **BizTalk Group** node, and then click **Properties**.

2. In the console tree of the **Group Properties** dialog box, click **Certificate**.

3. In the **Certificate** pane, click **Browse**, find the certificate you want to use for signing, and then click **OK**.

   > [!NOTE]
   >  Instead of entering the common name of the certificate, you can enter just the thumbprint. You can get the thumbprint by double-clicking the certificate in the certificate store in MMC or in the file system, clicking the **Details** tab, clicking the **Thumbprint** field, and copying the thumbprint.

4. Click **OK**.

### To configure a certificate for signing outgoing AS2 messages for a specific party

1. In the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console, click the **Parties** node. From the **Parties and Business Profiles** pane, from the **Agreements** section, right-click the agreement that is created for exchanging messages with a specific party, and click **Properties**.

2. On a one-way agreement tab, click **Signature Certificates**.

3. Select the **Override group signing certificate** check box to use the certificate provided in this page for signing outgoing AS2 messages and MDN.

4. Click **Browse** to display the **Select Certificate** dialog box, where you select the signature certificate to apply to messages transmitted by this party.

5. The **Common Name** text box displays a description of the selected certificate.

6. The **Thumbprint** text box displays the thumbprint of certificate. The certificate thumbprint has the format HHHH HHHH HHHH HHHH HHHH HHHH HHHH HHHH HHHH HHHH, where H is a hexadecimal digit (a number from 0 through 9 or a letter from A through F).

7. Click **Remove Certificate** to remove the selected certificate.

8. Click **OK** to validate the changes and then close the dialog box.

### To configure a certificate for verifying the digital signature of an incoming AS2 messages

1. In the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console, open the **BizTalk Group** node, and then click the **Parties** node.

2. In the **Parties and Business Profiles** pane, right-click the party that you will be receiving signed messages from, and then click **Properties**.

3. In the console tree, click **Certificate**.

4. In the **Certificate** pane, click **Browse**, find the certificate you want to use for verifying the digital signature, and then click **OK**.

   > [!NOTE]
   >  Instead of entering the common name of the certificate, you can enter just the thumbprint. You can get the thumbprint by double-clicking the certificate in the certificate store in MMC or in the file system, clicking the **Details** tab, clicking the **Thumbprint** field, and copying the thumbprint.

5. Click **OK**.

### To configure a certificate for encrypting an outgoing AS2 messages

1. In the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console, open the **BizTalk Group** node, open the **Applications** node, and open the node of the **application** that contains the send port that you will be sending the encrypted message on.

2. Open the **Send Ports** node, right-click the send port, and then click **Properties**.

3. In the console tree, click **Certificate**.

4. In the **Certificate** pane, click **Browse**, find the certificate that you want to use for encryption, and then click **OK**.

   > [!NOTE]
   >  Instead of entering the common name of the certificate, you can enter just the thumbprint. You can get the thumbprint by double-clicking the certificate in the certificate store in MMC or in the file system, clicking the **Details** tab, clicking the **Thumbprint** field, and copying the thumbprint.

5. Click **OK**.
