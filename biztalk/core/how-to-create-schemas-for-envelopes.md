# Create Schemas for Envelopes

## Overview
After creating an XML message schema as described in [Creating Schemas for XML Messages](../core/how-to-create-schemas-for-xml-messages.md), set the **Envelope** property of the **Schema** node to **Yes**. Depending on certain characteristics of your envelope schema, such as whether there are multiple root nodes, you will need to set several other envelope-specific properties. For more information, see [Envelope Schemas](../core/envelope-schemas.md).  
  
 The body XPath property of the envelope points to the element that contains the document elements. The actual element where the XPath points to does not belong to the document.
