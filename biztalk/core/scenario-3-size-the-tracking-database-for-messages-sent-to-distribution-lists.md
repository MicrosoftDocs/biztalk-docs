# Scenario 3: Sizing the Tracking Database  for Messages Sent Out to Distribution Lists
In the following figure, you have a message that proceeds through an orchestration, is changed within the orchestration, and is then sent out to several different send ports through a distribution list.  
  
 ![Message through an orchestration to multiple ports](../core/media/biztalk-server-message-orch-multiple-ports.gif "BizTalk_Server_message_orch_multiple_ports")  
  
 **BizTalk Server message that proceeds through an orchestration and is sent out to several different ports**  
  
 Here are some of the facts concerning this scenario:  
  
- The message size is 10K.  
  
- You are not promoting any properties.  
  
- The number of messages you receive in a year is 3.5 million.  
  
- Tracking is turned on for all events. There are five events in this scenario:  
  
  -   Receipt of message M0  
  
  -   Output of message M1 from the receive port  
  
  -   Output of message M3 by the send port  
  
  -   Output of message M4 by the send port  
  
  -   Output of message M5 by the send port  
  
  Applying this information to the equation gives the following:  
  
```  
[(5*252 bytes) + (10*182 bytes) + (0*5(40 bytes + 0) * 3,500,000]/1024/1024  
[(1620 + 1820 + 0) * 3,500,000]/1024/1024 = 10280.61 MB ~ 10.04 GB per year  
```  
  
## Messages in an orchestration that are sent out to a distribution list with a single promoted property  
 In this example, let's promote a single property, approximately 10 bytes in size, as we did in an earlier scenario. The equation now looks like this:  
  
```  
[((5*150 bytes) + (10*230 bytes) + (1*5(52 bytes + 10 bytes)) * 3,500,000]/1024/1024  
[(750 + 2300 + 260) * 3,500,000]/1024/1024 = 11048 MB ~ 10.79 GB per year  
```  
  
 If we promote an additional property that is 20 bytes in size the equation now looks like this:  
  
```  
[((5*150 bytes) + (10*230 bytes) + ((1*5(52 bytes + 10 bytes) + (1*5(52 bytes + 20 bytes)) * 3,500,000]/1024/1024  
[(750 + 2300 + 670) * 3,500,000]/1024/1024 = 12417 MB ~ 12.13 GB per year  
```  
  
## Messages in an orchestration that are sent out to a distribution list with message body tracking activated  
 If you want to accommodate message tracking, the equation will look like the following for this example:  
  
```  
[3,500,000 * 6 * 5KB]/1024 = 102539.06 MB ~ 100.14 GB per year  
  
```
