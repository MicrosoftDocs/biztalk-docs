# How to Add Index Functoids to a Map
The **Index** functoid enables you to select information from a specific record in a series of looping records. Each **Index** functoid selects information from a single field.  
  
 For conceptual information about the **Index** functoid, see [Index Functoid](../core/index-functoid.md).  
  
### To add the Index functoid to a map and configure it  
  
1. With the [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] Toolbox active, click the **Advanced Functoids** tab to select that category of functoids.  
  
    The list of advanced functoids in the chosen category appears.  
  
2. Drag the **Index** functoid (![Small image showing the icon for the Index functoid.](../core/media/bts-tls-index.gif)) from the Toolbox to the appropriate location on a grid page.  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   >  The functoid will be placed on the displayed grid page. If you want to put the functoid onto a different grid page, you need to display the other grid page first.  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   >  If you are constructing a map using more than one functoid together, you need to consider their relative left-to-right placement. Functoids are executed from left to right. The output of a functoid can only be input to another functoid that is farther to the right.  
  
3. To establish the field input parameter for the **Index** functoid, create an input link by dragging a field within a looping record from the source schema to the **Index** functoid, or dragging the **Index** functoid to a field within the looping record in the source schema.  
  
4. To establish at least one index input parameter for the **Index** functoid, perform the following steps:  
  
   1.  With the **Index** functoid selected, click the ellipsis (**...**) button associated with the **Input Parameters** property in the **Properties** window.  
  
   2.  In the **Configure Index Functoid** dialog box, click the ![Adding constant input parameters to a functoid](../core/media/add-input-parameters.gif "Add_input_parameters") button.  
  
   3.  In the edit box, type the index input parameter as a numeric value. Repeat as necessary if additional index values are required, and then click **OK**.  
  
5. To use the output parameter from the **Index** functoid, create an output link by dragging the **Index** functoid to a field in the destination schema, or by dragging a field in the destination schema to the **Index** functoid.  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   >  As with other functoids, the output of the **Index** functoid can be used as input to another functoid.
