# Choice Group Nodes
In BizTalk Editor, you can insert a **Choice Group** node to contain other nodes (or entire subtrees of nodes), only one of which can appear in an instance message. A given instance message, if valid, will have only one of the choices present. The contained nodes must be nodes that correspond to XML elements, but cannot be nodes that correspond to XML attributes.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  In BizTalk Editor, the **Choice Group** node is represented with the string \<Choice\> in the schema tree view. If you set a reference to a **Choice Group** node, such as x, it is represented as \<Group:x\> in the schema tree view.  
  
## XSD representation  
 When a **Choice Group** node is inserted into a **Record** node, it is inserted at the end of any other child nodes within the **sequence**, **choice**, or **all** element in the **Record** node. The following example shows, in bold type, how a new **Choice Group** node is represented in the XML Schema definition (XSD) language as a **choice** element inserted at the end of the **sequence** element in a **Record** node (with nodes named to clarify their identity).  
  
```  
<xs:element name="ContainingRecord">  
    <xs:complexType>  
        <xs:sequence>  
            <xs:element name="ExistingFieldElement" type="xs:string" />  
        </xs:sequence>  
    </xs:complexType>  
</xs:element>  
  
```  
  
 By default, the **choice** element is given a **minOccurs** attribute value of zero (0), indicating that none of the choices need occur. You can change this value in the Visual Studio Properties window when the **Choice Group** node is selected in the schema tree view.  
  
 The following example shows the same **choice** element with the XSD **element** elements corresponding to two subordinate **Record** nodes.  
  
```  
<xs:element name="ContainingRecord">  
    <xs:complexType>  
        <xs:sequence>  
            <xs:element name="ExistingFieldElement" type="xs:string" />  
            <xs:choice minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1">  
                <xs:element name="usAddress">  
                    <xs:complexType>  
                        <xs:sequence>  
                        </xs:sequence>  
                    </xs:complexType>  
                </xs:element>  
                <xs:element name="foreignAddress">  
                    <xs:complexType>  
                        <xs:sequence>  
                        </xs:sequence>  
                    </xs:complexType>  
                </xs:element>  
            </xs:choice>  
        </xs:sequence>  
    </xs:complexType>  
</xs:element>  
```  
  
 In this example, two sibling **Record** nodes are used to describe the fact that an instance message will either have a record with United States address information in it, or a record with worldwide address information in it. Further, the **minOccurs** and **maxOccurs** properties of the **Choice Group** node have both been set to one (1) in the Visual Studio Properties window, resulting in the *minOccurs* and *maxOccurs* attributes of the **choice** element being set to one (1) in the XSD representation.
