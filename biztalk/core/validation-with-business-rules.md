# Validation with Business Rules
A common way to do validation is to construct a set of business rules using the Business Rules Framework. Then you use the Call Rules shape in the orchestration where you want to perform validation.  
  
 In the business process management application, the **Validation** orchestration uses business rules to test the validity of the order.  
  
 Using the Business Rules Framework enables you to change the rules without recompiling and redeploying the **Validation** orchestration. The trade-off is that for simple sets of rules, you may be able to save processing time by coding the logic in the orchestration.  
  
 For more information about using the Business Rules Framework, see [Creating and Using Business Rules](../core/creating-and-using-business-rules.md). For more information about the Call Rules shape, see [How to Use the Call Rules Shape](../core/how-to-use-the-call-rules-shape.md).
