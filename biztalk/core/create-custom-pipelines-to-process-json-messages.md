# Create custom pipelines to process JSON messages
> [!NOTE]
>  This tutorial applies to [!INCLUDE[prague](../includes/prague-md.md)] only.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] provides pipeline components that can be used to process JSON messages within a [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] application. In this step, we use those pipeline components to create custom pipelines that can be used when configuring a [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] application.  
  
## Create a custom receive pipeline  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] application, from the Solution Explorer, right-click the project, and point to **Add** > **New Item** > **Receive Pipeline**. Provide the pipeline name as `JSONToXmlReceivePipeline.btp`, and then click **Add**.  
  
2.  Within the **Decode** stage add the new **JSON decoder**. In the other stages and other pipeline components as shown in the screenshot, and save changes.

## Create a custom send pipeline  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] application, from the Solution Explorer, right-click the project, and point to **Add** > **New Item** > **Send Pipeline**. Provide the pipeline name as `XmlToJSONSendPipeline.btp`, and then click **Add**.  
  
2.  Within the **Encode** stage add the new **JSON encoder**. In the other stages and other pipeline components as shown in the screenshot, and save changes.
