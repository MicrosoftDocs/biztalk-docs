# Testing Policies
This section describes how you can test policies and explains the tracking information.  
  
 You can use Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] to monitor rule activities and track the overall progress of an orchestration that uses the Business Rules Framework. The tracking information for rules that you see in the Group Overview page is the same as the output of policy testing in the Business Rule Composer.  
  
 For more information about using tracking, see [How to Configure Tracking for a Policy](../core/how-to-configure-tracking-for-a-policy.md).
