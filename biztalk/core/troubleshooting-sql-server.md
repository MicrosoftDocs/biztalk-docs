# Troubleshooting SQL Server
The majority of Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] issues that affect Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] fall into one of the following categories:  
  
-   Connectivity-related problems  
  
-   Permissions-related problems  
  
-   Database-sizing problems  
  
 This topic discusses each of these categories and steps that you can take to resolve the associated problems.  
  
## Connectivity-Related Problems  
 The following issues are most commonly associated with connectivity problems between the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] computer and the [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] computer that houses the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] databases.  
  
#### Errors related to failed transactions or "Communication with the underlying transaction manager" errors are written to the BizTalk Server Application log  
  
##### Problem  
 Errors indicating an MSDTC transaction failure or a failure to communicate with the underlying transaction manager are written to the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Application log.  
  
##### Cause  
 MSDTC connectivity between [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)]and[!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] has failed.  
  
##### Resolution  
 For information about troubleshooting MSDTC connectivity between the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] computer and the [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] computer that houses the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] databases, see [Troubleshooting Problems with MSDTC](../core/troubleshooting-problems-with-msdtc.md).  
  
#### Error "A connection was successfully established with the server, but then an error occurred during the pre-login handshake" occurs when connecting to remote SQL Server databases on SQL Server 2008  
  
##### Problem  
 [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] loses connectivity with a remote [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] computer that houses the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] databases and an error message is generated:  
  
##### Cause  
 This problem may occur if one or more of the following conditions is true:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] is not configured to accept remote connections.  
  
-   The necessary protocols for [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] are not enabled on either the [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] computer or the [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] client computer that is running [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)].  
  
##### Resolution  
 Follow these steps to resolve this problem:  
  
-   The **SQL Server Surface Area Configuration** tool is not available on SQL Server 2008. To enable remote connections for [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] on a SQL Server 2008 computer follow the instructions in the SQL Server 2008 online help.  
  
-   Use the **SQL Server Configuration Manager** tool to enable the **TCP/IP** and/or the **Named Pipes** protocols on the [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] computer.  
  
    1.  Click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, and click **SQL Server Configuration Manager**.  
  
    2.  Click to expand **SQL Server Network Configuration** and then click **Protocols for MSSQLSERVER**.  
  
    3.  Right-click the **TCP/IP** protocol and then click **Enable**.  
  
    4.  Right-click the **Named Pipes** protocol and then click **Enable**.  
  
    5.  Close the **SQL Server Configuration Manager** tool.  
  
-   Use the **SQL Server Configuration Manager** tool to enable the **TCP/IP** and/or the **Named Pipes** protocols on the [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] client computer that is running [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)].  
  
    1.  Click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, and click **SQL Server Configuration Manager**.  
  
    2.  Click to expand **SQL Server Network Configuration** and then click **ClientProtocols**.  
  
    3.  Right-click the **TCP/IP** protocol and then click **Enable**.  
  
    4.  Right-click the **Named Pipes** protocol and then click **Enable**.  
  
    5.  Close the **SQL Server Configuration Manager** tool.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Ensure that at least one of the protocols on the [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] client computer that is running [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] matches the protocols enabled on the [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] computer.  
  
#### A BizTalk host instance fails and a "General Network" error is written to the Application log when the BizTalk Server-based server processes a high volume of documents  
  
##### Problem  
 When processing a high volume of documents, a BizTalk host instance fails, and a "General Network" error is written to the Application log.  
  
##### Cause  
 This issue occurs because Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsWinSvr2k8](../includes/btswinsvr2k8-md.md)] implements a security feature that reduces the size of the queue for concurrent TCP/IP connections to the server. This feature helps prevent denial of service attacks.  
  
##### Resolution  
 For more information about resolving this issue, see [Avoiding DBNETLIB Exceptions](../core/avoiding-dbnetlib-exceptions.md).  
  
## Permissions-Related Problems  
  
#### BizTalk Server run-time or design-time operations fail and a "cannot open database requested in login \<database\>" error is written to the Application log of the BizTalk Server or SQL Server computer  
  
##### Problem  
 A run-time or design-time operation fails and an error similar to the following is written to the application log of the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] computer:  
  
 Cannot open database requested in login \<*database*\>. Login fails.   
Login failed for user \<*username*\>.  
  
##### Cause  
 This error can occur if the specified account does not belong to the appropriate Windows group or [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] role.  
  
##### Resolution  
 Ensure that the specified account is a member of the appropriate Windows group or [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] role. For more information about the appropriate memberships, see [Windows Groups and User Accounts in BizTalk Server](../core/windows-groups-and-user-accounts-in-biztalk-server.md).  
  
## Database-Sizing Problems  
 If the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] databases grow unchecked then the performance of the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] environment will be adversely affected. Follow the steps below to manage the growth of the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] databases.  
  
#### The BizTalk Server MessageBox database is growing unchecked and impacting overall performance  
  
##### Problem  
 Growth of the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] MessageBox database is adversely affecting performance of the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] environment.  
  
##### Cause  
 This problem can occur if the SQL Agent jobs that maintain the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] databases are not running.  
  
##### Resolution  
 Ensure that the SQL Agent jobs that maintain the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] databases are running. See [Database Structure and Jobs](../core/database-structure-and-jobs.md) for a complete list of the SQL Agent jobs that are installed with [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)].  
  
#### The BizTalk Server tracking database is growing unchecked and impacting overall performance  
  
##### Problem  
 The [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] tracking database is growing unchecked and is adversely affecting the overall performance of the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] environment.  
  
##### Cause  
 This problem can occur if steps are not taken to purge and archive the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] tracking database.  
  
##### Resolution  
 Steps should be taken to purge and archive the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] tracking database. See [Archiving and Purging the BizTalk Tracking Database](../core/archiving-and-purging-the-biztalk-tracking-database.md) for more information.
