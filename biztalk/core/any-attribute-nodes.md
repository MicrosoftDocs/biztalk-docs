# Any Attribute Nodes
In BizTalk Editor, you can use an **Any Attribute** node to indicate a (known) element within an instance message for which zero or more unknown attributes may appear. This accommodates situations in which you know that a particular element will be present at a particular location within an instance message, but you are not sure exactly what attributes that element might include. If you place an **Any Attribute** node within the **Record** node associated with the relevant element, BizTalk can process that element, with the only requirement being that any associated attributes are syntactically correct (attributeName="attributeValue").  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  In BizTalk Editor, the **Any Attribute** node is represented with the string \<AnyAttribute\> in the schema tree view.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can control the degree to which the unknown portion of the message is validated as well-formed XML by using the **Process Contents** property. In many cases you may need to set the **Process Contents** property to **Skip** for the contents of an instance message at the location of the **Any Attribute** node to be processed. Retaining the default value of **Strict** for the **Process Contents** property will prevent instance message validation from passing.

## XSD representation  
 When an **Any Attribute** node is added to a **Record** node or to an **Attribute Group** node, a single XML tag is added to the corresponding XML Schema definition (XSD) language representation of the schema. In the following example, a new **Any Attribute** node, whose XSD representation is shown in bold, has been added to an existing **Record** node that already contains a **Field Element** node.  
  
```  
<xs:element name="ExistingRecord">  
    <xs:complexType>  
        <xs:sequence>  
            <xs:element name="ExistingFieldElement" type="xs:string" />  
        </xs:sequence>  
        <xs:anyAttribute />  
    </xs:complexType>  
</xs:element  
```  
  
 In the preceding example, the XSD representation of the new **Any Attribute** node adds an **anyAttribute** element to the end of the containing (**Record** node) **element** element, outside the **sequence** element and within the **complexType** element. This is where all **attribute** elements, other than those with an **Attribute Group** node, are added to their containing **element** elements.  
  
 Now, and assuming that the **Process Contents** property of the **Any Attribute** node is set to **Skip**, within an instance message governed by this schema fragment, an **ExistingRecord** element is expected, and it can contain any attributes so long as they are well-formed with respect to XML syntax. (To conform to the XSD fragment in this example, it must also contain the **ExistingFieldElement** element as well.)
