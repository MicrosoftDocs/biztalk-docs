# Host Instances
A *host instance* is the physical installation of a host in a BizTalk Server. An administrator uses Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) or the BizTalk Administration Console to install host instances. A BizTalk Server can support multiple host instances.  
  
 The following figure shows the relationship between servers, hosts, and host instances.
