# GetActivityName
Pushes the name of the current activity onto the stack.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
<wf:Operation Name="GetActivityName"/>  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 None.  
  
## Pushed Value  
 String containing the current activity name.  
  
## Remarks  
 Windows Workflow Foundation performs its work as a series of activities configured by the developer. Each of these activities is assigned a unique name within the workflow. You can intercept data for a specific activity by filtering based on its unique name.  
  
## Example  
 The following sample contains an event filter expression configured to find a specific activity—FoodAndDrinksPolicy—in a Closed workflow. This is done by using a combination of operations including `GetActivityName`, `GetActivityEvent`, and logical operations.  
  
```  
<ic:Filter>  
  <ic:Expression>  
    <wf:Operation Name="GetActivityName"/>  
    <ic:Operation Name="Constant">  
      <ic:Argument>FoodAndDrinksPolicy</ic:Argument>  
    </ic:Operation>  
    <ic:Operation Name="Equals"/>  
    <wf:Operation Name="GetActivityEvent"/>  
    <ic:Operation Name="Constant">  
      <ic:Argument>Closed</ic:Argument>  
    </ic:Operation>  
    <ic:Operation Name="Equals"/>  
    <ic:Operation Name="And"/>  
  </ic:Expression>  
</ic:Filter>  
```  
  
 This filter pattern is common with Windows Workflow Foundation interceptor configuration files.
