# Managing Aggregations
Aggregations are cumulative operations against a data set to derive a generally representative characteristic or description for that data set. This section describes how to manage different elements of an aggregation, such as indexes, activities, and real-time aggregations (RTAs).  
  
 For general information about aggregations, see [Aggregations in the BAM Portal](../core/aggregations-in-the-bam-portal.md) and [Aggregations on the BAM Portal Page](../core/aggregations-on-the-bam-portal-page.md).
